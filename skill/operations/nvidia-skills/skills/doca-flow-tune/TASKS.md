# DOCA Flow Tune — Tasks

**Where to start:** The verbs that carry real workflow content are
`## configure`, `## run`, `## modify`, `## test`, `## debug`, and
`## use`. `## install` and `## build` are routing stubs because the
binary is shipped pre-built; `## modify` is substantive for this
tool because the *output* of a tune session is a recommendation
that gets applied back to the surrounding `doca-flow` program via
the universal modify-a-sample workflow.

This file is loaded by [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) after
[`CAPABILITIES.md`](CAPABILITIES.md). It walks the agent through
the in-scope task verbs and the agent-side `## use` workflow, then
explicitly defers verbs that do not belong here.

For `doca_flow_tune`, the verbs that carry real workflow content
are `configure`, `run`, `modify`, `test`, `debug`, and `use`. The
other two (`install`, `build`) carry meaningful **routing stubs**
because the binary is shipped pre-built.

## install

`doca_flow_tune` is **shipped pre-built** with the DOCA install
when the Flow tune package profile is present. There is no
separate install workflow this skill owns.

Routing for nearby "install" questions:

- *"The binary isn't there — do I need to install something?"* →
  yes. Route to
  [`doca-setup ## configure`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure)
  for the DOCA install with the appropriate package profile, or
  to [`doca-setup ## no-install`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install)
  for the public NGC DOCA container path when the user has no
  install yet.
- *"I want a structured probe before installing"* → the
  detect → prefer → fall back → report contract per
  [`doca-structured-tools-contract`](../../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md)
  is the right surface; the structured helpers it documents
  (`doca-env --json` for version + libraries + drivers in one
  shot) are the cheapest pre-install reconnaissance.

The `## What this skill deliberately does not ship` block in
[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) forbids adding an install recipe here;
revisit that policy before changing this section.

## configure

`configure` for `doca_flow_tune` is *"decide the three-axis
configuration AND pick the operating mode AND populate the JSON
config file BEFORE invoking the binary"*. The three axes
(tuning axis × measurement × scope) are laid out in
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes);
the three modes (offline / online read-only / online
state-changing) are owned there as well. Skipping this verb is
the canonical Flow-tune failure mode.

Steps the agent should walk the user through, in order:

1. **Confirm DOCA is installed and the Flow library is present.**
   Run [`doca-setup ## test`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#test) and
   confirm `pkg-config --modversion doca-flow` resolves. If the
   user has no install yet, route to
   [`doca-setup ## no-install`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install)
   before any tune discussion. The tool has nothing to do if
   `doca-flow` is not present.
2. **Confirm a `doca-flow` application is running (online modes)
   or a captured config is on hand (offline mode).** Per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   operating-modes table; offline mode consumes a captured JSON
   only, online mode requires the application.
3. **Decide tune vs perf.** Per the *tune-vs-perf* boundary in
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes);
   if the user's question is *"what is the baseline number"*,
   route to [`doca-flow-perf`](../doca-flow-perf/SKILL.md) or
   [`doca-flow-dpa-perf`](../doca-flow-dpa-perf/SKILL.md) instead
   of this skill. Tune does not produce a primary baseline number.
4. **Axis 1 — pick the tuning axis.** Per the three-axis table in
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes),
   commit explicitly to which class of change is being explored
   (rule placement, resource hints / table sizing, hardware-
   offload mode). Naming one and dropping the others silently
   narrows the session.
5. **Axis 2 — pick the measurement.** Rule-install rate vs lookup
   latency vs hardware-counter delta. The measurement must match
   the tuning axis; the agent should quote *why* it picked the
   measurement so the user can challenge the framing.
6. **Axis 3 — pick the scope.** Confirm the PCI address set and
   the `flow_port_id` set the session will look at. The shipped
   `flow_tune_cfg_public.json` template documents the
   `monitor.hardware.pci_addresses` and
   `monitor.software[*].flow_port_id` fields as the scope-naming
   knobs; confirm against the live application's port set.
7. **Pick the operating mode.** Offline / online read-only /
   online state-changing per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes).
   The state-changing mode is high-stakes; the agent must surface
   the [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy`](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy)
   rules before recommending it.
8. **Populate the JSON config file.** Start from the shipped
   `flow_tune_cfg_public.json` template on the user's install (or
   `flow_tune_cfg_hardware_only.json` /
   `flow_tune_cfg_software_only.json` for the subset variants);
   set `outputs_directory`, the `network.server_uds` socket path,
   the `dumper` / `analyze` / `visualize` / `monitor` sections
   per the chosen scope and mode. The shipped templates are the
   schema source of truth on the user's installed version; do
   not invent field names from prose memory.
9. **Sanity check before any invocation.** Confirm with the user:
   what is the question (tune vs perf)? Which pipeline? Which
   tuning axis? Which measurement? Which mode? If any answer is
   unclear, stop and ask — do NOT run the tune binary against a
   fuzzy posture.

If steps 1-9 read clean, proceed to [`## run`](#run). If any step
surfaces a precondition failure, walk the error taxonomy in
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
before retrying.

## build

`doca_flow_tune` is **shipped pre-built** as part of every DOCA
install that includes the Flow tune package. There is no source
tree the external user is expected to compile, no build flags,
no `meson` or `make` workflow for the tool itself.

Routing for nearby "build" questions:

- *"The binary isn't there — do I need to build it?"* → no.
  Route to [`## install`](#install). The fix is to install (or
  re-install) DOCA with the right package profile.
- *"I want to build my own DOCA Flow tuning analyzer."* → not a
  `doca_flow_tune` question. Route to
  [`doca-programming-guide ## build`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#build)
  for the cross-library build pattern and to
  [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## build`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#build)
  for the Flow-specific build overlay; the tune binary is the
  shipped harness, a bespoke analyzer is a different artifact.
- *"I want the trace-build flavor of `doca-flow` so the tune
  attach role works."* → the trace-flavor question belongs to
  [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## build`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#build);
  this skill does not duplicate the Flow build recipe.

The `## What this skill deliberately does not ship` block in
[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) forbids shipping a build recipe for the
tune binary or wrappers around it.

## modify

`modify` for `doca_flow_tune` is substantive: the *output* of a
tune session is a recommendation, and applying the recommendation
is a `doca-flow` *program* change. The agent does not modify the
shipped tune binary; the agent modifies the surrounding
`doca-flow` application's code via the universal modify-a-sample
workflow.

The pattern:

1. **Read the analyze / visualize output as evidence, not as
   answer.** Per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](CAPABILITIES.md#observability),
   the analyze JSON and visualize mermaid file are *recommendations
   under named assumptions*; the named assumptions (chosen tuning
   axis, captured before-state, three-axis decision) are the
   provenance of the recommendation.
2. **Translate the recommendation into a Flow-program change
   proposal.** Per
   [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## modify`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#modify),
   identify which Flow API call in the program is the lever the
   recommendation moves (a pipe attribute, a resource-hint
   parameter, a steering-mode selection). If the recommendation
   does not correspond to a knob the program exposes, surface
   that as
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
   layer 5 (recommendation-unactionable) rather than guessing at
   a wider modification.
3. **Obtain explicit confirmation for this recommendation.**
   Present the exact recommendation, target pipe / scope,
   selected tuning axis, proposed minimum diff, expected
   measurement direction, and rollback snapshot. Ask the user
   to confirm this specific change before modifying the Flow
   program. Confirmation of one recommendation does not cover
   another; without confirmation, stop at the proposal.
4. **Apply the minimum diff.** Walk
   [`doca-programming-guide TASKS.md ## modify`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#modify)
   for the cross-library minimum-diff modification pattern; the
   shipped DOCA Flow samples on disk are the verified source of
   truth, the tune recommendation is the *direction* of the diff
   on top.
5. **Re-run the tune session against the post-change state.**
   The before / after pair is the only defensible artifact; a
   recommendation applied without a captured before snapshot and
   a captured after snapshot cannot be evaluated. The
   eval-loop overlay in [`## test`](#test) enforces this.

Routing for nearby "modify" questions:

- *"Can I patch the `doca_flow_tune` binary itself?"* → out of
  scope. The shipped binary is the contract; modifying it is a
  contributor question, not an external-consumer question.
- *"Can I edit the dumper CSV format?"* → no; the documented
  CSV format is the documented format. If the user wants a
  different post-processing surface, the right answer is *"read
  the shipped `hw_counters_csv_analyzer.py` and adapt the
  parsing for your downstream tool"*, but even the adapter is
  out of scope per
  [`SKILL.md ## What this skill deliberately does not ship`](SKILL.md#what-this-skill-deliberately-does-not-ship).

## run

The snapshot → analyze → visualize → propose loop. The full
invocation surface lives in the public DOCA Flow Tune guide;
this section names the *shape* of the flow, not verbatim
command lines (per
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy`](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy)
*"do not invent flags"*).

1. **Confirm the binary, version, and JSON config are
   consistent.** Per [`## configure`](#configure) steps 1-8.
   Quote `pkg-config --modversion doca-flow` and the tune
   binary's `--version` against
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## test`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#test)
   so the four-way match is anchored before invocation.
2. **Smoke run — offline first.** When a captured pipeline-
   description JSON is on hand, run the offline analyze /
   visualize chain against it as the cheapest read-only smoke.
   Goal: *the tool can parse the config, render the analyze
   output, and render the visualize output*. The smoke is not
   a usable recommendation; it is a precondition check.
3. **Online read-only snapshot.** When a live application is
   available, attach via the documented IPC channel (per the
   `network.server_uds` field on the user's installed
   templates), run the dumper / monitor for the configured
   duration, and capture the CSV + JSON + mermaid outputs into
   the directory named by `outputs_directory`. This is the
   *online-mode read-only smoke* per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   operating-modes table.
4. **Read the analyze and visualize outputs.** Per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](CAPABILITIES.md#observability),
   the analyze JSON is the structured recommendation surface
   and the visualize mermaid is the human-readable pipe layout.
   Quote what they said — do not paraphrase the recommendation
   away.
5. **Inspect the dumper CSV for soundness.** Per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
   layer 4, an exit-0 run with numbers is not enough — verify
   warm-up actually happened, verify the captured counters
   reflect steady state, verify outliers / distribution are
   captured alongside any single number.
6. **STOP here unless the user has committed to applying a
   recommendation.** Steps 1-5 are the read-only surface; the
   high-stakes step is [`## modify`](#modify) (apply the
   recommendation back to the Flow program) and is gated on
   the smoke in [`## test`](#test).
7. **For the exact, current invocation surface — mode flag
   names, JSON config field names, dumper CSV columns,
   analyze JSON schema, visualize mermaid format — read
   `--help`** on the installed binary and the shipped
   `flow_tune_cfg*.json` templates plus the public DOCA Flow
   Tune guide via
   [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA tools`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-tools).
   Do **not** invent any of these.

When recording the run for downstream consumers, write down: the
DOCA version, the host (host x86 / Arm, BlueField Arm, or NGC
container), the full JSON config file used, the exact command
line, the device target (PCI address set), and the full
unredacted dumper / analyze / visualize output. The downstream
[`## test`](#test) and [`## debug`](#debug) workflows depend on
those fields.

## test

`doca_flow_tune` is **a recommendation tool**, so its `## test`
verb is about *testing the recommendation* — i.e. confirming the
before / after pair is sound and reproducible — not unit-testing
the binary itself.

**`## test` is an iterative loop, not a one-shot pass.** Every
mutation — a Flow-program change derived from a recommendation, a
driver / firmware change under the application, a BlueField mode
flip, a DOCA reinstall — re-opens the smoke.

The smoke-before-bulk shape:

1. **Capture a pre-change snapshot.** Run the online read-only
   smoke per [`## run`](#run) steps 3-5; the resulting CSV +
   analyze JSON + visualize mermaid is the *before* leg.
2. **Confirm the four-way version match.** Quote the tune
   binary's `--version`, the application-side
   `pkg-config --modversion doca-flow`, and the host package
   version per
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## test`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#test).
   A measurement under a partial install is not a measurement of
   anything the operator can defend.
3. **Confirm, then apply the recommendation via
   [`## modify`](#modify).** Obtain the per-recommendation
   confirmation required by `## modify` step 3 before the
   minimum-diff change lands in the application's source;
   redeploy the application on its documented cadence.
4. **Capture a post-change snapshot.** Re-run step 1 against the
   redeployed application; the resulting outputs are the
   *after* leg.
5. **Diff the two legs.** Use the shipped `flow_json_diff.py` /
   `flow_mermaid_diff.py` helpers under the tool's `scripts/`
   directory for the structural and counter diff; quote the diff
   the script produced, do not paraphrase it.
6. **Only after steps 1-5 read clean** may the agent declare the
   tuning iteration converged on a real change. If the after-leg
   measurement does not move in the direction the recommendation
   predicted, reselect exactly one of the three axes and run one
   new confirmed recommendation. If that second attempt is also
   non-green, restore the pre-change snapshot via
   [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## rollback`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#rollback),
   report both diffs, and escalate the unresolved gap. Do not
   start a third tuning attempt.

Eval-loop overlay (rows apply to every tune session):

| Iteration trigger | What it looks like | What changes next iteration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smoke completed; analyze recommendation does not match the question | Could be the wrong tuning axis was selected, the wrong measurement was selected, or the scope is wrong | Reselect exactly one axis in [`## configure`](#configure), obtain fresh per-recommendation confirmation, and run once. If that second attempt is non-green, roll back and escalate; do not reselect another axis. |
| Online attach fails on a known-good Flow app | Attach-failed layer per [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy) layer 2; not a measurement-soundness issue | Walk [`## debug`](#debug) layer 2; do not loop on the dumper expecting different output |
| Before / after diff is empty when a Flow-program change shipped | Either the change did not deploy, or the captured before-leg snapshot was already the post-change state | Re-confirm the Flow application's running version, re-capture the before leg from a known-pre-change state |
| Recommendation says *"increase table size"* but the Flow program hard-codes the value | Recommendation-unactionable layer 5; not a tune bug | Modify the Flow program per [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## modify`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#modify) to expose the knob, then re-run the tune session |
| After-leg measurement is in the opposite direction from the prediction | Could be a real regression the recommendation introduced, or could be a different workload running on the device | Re-confirm workload stability, quote the diff, then reselect one axis and retry once with fresh confirmation. On a second non-green result, restore the pre-change snapshot and escalate through [`doca-debug ## debug`](../../doca-debug/SKILL.md); no third attempt. |

This skill does **not** ship a "test fixture" or pre-recorded
expected output. The expected output is install-, device-,
firmware-, application-, and DOCA-version-specific. See
[`SKILL.md ## What this skill deliberately does not ship`](SKILL.md#what-this-skill-deliberately-does-not-ship).

## debug

When `doca_flow_tune` fails to attach, produces empty output,
produces a recommendation that does not move the measurement, or
disagrees with the Flow application's own view, walk the
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
layers in order:

1. **Config-syntax.** Invocation / JSON config does not parse.
   Confirm flag / field exists on the installed binary and the
   shipped `flow_tune_cfg*.json` templates; confirm units /
   values are in the documented form. Do not infer from generic
   CLI / JSON intuition.
2. **Attach-failed (online mode).** Confirm the live Flow
   application is up via
   [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## test`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#test);
   confirm the `network.server_uds` path matches the
   application's actual setting; confirm filesystem permissions
   and namespace boundary. Re-attempt only after the application
   is on the snapshot.
3. **Pipe-not-found.** Confirm the pipe set against the Flow
   application's own view per
   [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## modify`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#modify);
   if the pipe is genuinely not created, the next move is the
   Flow program, not the tune binary.
4. **Measurement-unsound.** Walk the three sub-layers per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
   layer 4 — warm-up / steady-state, outliers / distribution,
   before / after pair captured — before quoting any
   recommendation.
5. **Recommendation-unactionable.** Surface the recommendation
   as a Flow-program-change proposal per [`## modify`](#modify);
   do not loop on tune trying to find a knob the program does
   not expose.
6. **Version.** Walk
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug)
   end-to-end with the four-way match captured. Common
   tune-specific symptom is a tune binary from a different DOCA
   train than the Flow application's linked library.
7. **Cross-cutting.** Hand off to
   [`doca-debug ## debug`](../../doca-debug/SKILL.md) for the
   cross-cutting debug ladder and
   [`doca-setup ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug) for
   the env-side layers.

In every case: **quote what the tool reported.** Do not
paraphrase the dumper CSV summary, do not reorder mermaid nodes,
do not summarize a recommendation into prose. The tune binary is
in the loop precisely to break the agent out of the
inference-from-datasheet trap.

## use

`## use` is the agent-side workflow for *consuming*
`doca_flow_tune` output as evidence inside a larger conversation
with the user — i.e. the workflow when the agent is the second
reader of a tune session the user (or a previous agent) ran.

The pattern:

1. **Read the four-tuple first.** Confirm the captured tune
   session names the command line + JSON config + DOCA version +
   device + as-deployed environment per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy`](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy)
   *"quote the four-tuple"* rule. A captured session that omits
   any leg is evidence that cannot be re-checked, and the agent
   should say so rather than draw inferences from it.
2. **Read the analyze / visualize outputs as scoped
   recommendations.** Per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](CAPABILITIES.md#observability),
   the analyze JSON's recommendation is conditioned on the
   chosen three-axis decision; an agent quoting the
   recommendation without re-stating the axes for the user is
   handing them an answer to an unstated question.
3. **Cross-check against the Flow application's own view.** Per
   the *quote, do not paraphrase* rule, the agent compares the
   captured tune session against the live Flow application's
   own counter / inspector surface per
   [`doca-flow CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](../../libs/doca-flow/CAPABILITIES.md#observability)
   when both are available. Disagreement is signal — it routes
   to [`## debug`](#debug) layer 6 (version) first.
4. **Route to [`## modify`](#modify) only after the agent
   confirms the recommendation maps to a knob the Flow program
   exposes.** Otherwise the recommendation is *recommendation-
   unactionable* per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
   layer 5; the right next step is a Flow-program proposal, not
   a tune re-run.
5. **Save the tune session alongside the perf baseline.** The
   tune recommendation is downstream of the perf baseline per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   tune-vs-perf table; quoting the recommendation without the
   baseline is half the picture and the
   [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug)
   ladder cannot pick up where the agent left off without both.

## Deferred task verbs

The verbs below are not `doca_flow_tune` work and should be
routed out before the agent does any of them under this skill's
name.

- **measure a Flow pipeline baseline** ⇒
  [`doca-flow-perf`](../doca-flow-perf/SKILL.md) (host-side) or
  [`doca-flow-dpa-perf`](../doca-flow-dpa-perf/SKILL.md) (DPA-
  offloaded). Tune does not produce a primary baseline number.
- **write a doca-flow application** ⇒
  [`doca-flow`](../../libs/doca-flow/SKILL.md), layered on
  [`doca-programming-guide`](../../doca-programming-guide/SKILL.md).
  Tune observes pipelines the program created; it does not
  create them.
- **install DOCA** ⇒
  [`doca-setup ## configure`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure)
  and [`## no-install`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install).
- **library-internal pipe / counter / inspector deep dive** ⇒
  [`doca-flow`](../../libs/doca-flow/SKILL.md). Tune transports
  the data the Flow library exposes programmatically; the deeper
  per-pipe semantics belong to the library.
- **streaming telemetry export of Flow KPIs to a production
  consumer** ⇒ not a `doca_flow_tune` feature, and tune is not
  positioned as a production telemetry surface. The DOCA
  Telemetry Service (DTS) is the documented telemetry surface;
  routing belongs in
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services).

## Command appendix

`doca_flow_tune`-specific invocation classes the verbs above
reach for. Every row is a CLASS — the agent must not invent
flags, JSON field names, or recommendation identifiers beyond
`--help` on the installed binary, the shipped
`flow_tune_cfg*.json` templates, and the public DOCA Flow Tune
guide.

**Infra-aware preamble (every row below).** Per the bundle's
detect → prefer → fall back → report contract documented in
[`doca-structured-tools-contract ## The agent behavior contract`](../../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md#the-agent-behavior-contract),
the agent should:

1. Probe for the matching structured helper FIRST (`doca-env --json`
   for version + devices + libraries + drivers + hugepages;
   `doca-capability-snapshot` for per-device capability flags;
   `version-matrix.json` for *"available since"* lookups).
2. If the probe succeeds, the structured tool's output is the
   authoritative answer and the agent SHOULD NOT also run the
   manual command in the row below. Report *"using structured
   `<tool>`"*.
3. If the probe fails, fall back to the manual command in the
   row. Report *"falling back to manual chain"*.
4. The schemas the structured tools emit are defined in
   [`doca-structured-tools-contract ## Schemas`](../../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md#schemas);
   the version-handling semantics are owned by
   [`doca-version`](../../doca-version/SKILL.md).

| Purpose (class) | Invocation (shape) | Owning step | Reads as healthy when … |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discover the documented flag surface | `doca_flow_tune --help` plus the public DOCA Flow Tune guide for long-form documentation | [`## configure`](#configure) step 4-7; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 1 | Prints the documented mode-flag inventory; the agent uses `--help` as the only source of truth for mode / scope flag names. |
| Read the shipped JSON config templates | Read `flow_tune_cfg_public.json`, `flow_tune_cfg_hardware_only.json`, `flow_tune_cfg_software_only.json` on the user's install | [`## configure`](#configure) step 8 | The templates' field set is the schema source of truth for the JSON the operator writes; do not infer fields not present in the templates. |
| Confirm the Flow library version on the application side | `pkg-config --modversion doca-flow` on the side the Flow app runs | [`## configure`](#configure) step 1; [`## test`](#test) step 2; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 6 | Matches the version reported by the tune binary's `--version`; disagreement = partial install (route to [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug) layer 2). |
| Run offline analyze / visualize against a captured config | The documented offline-mode invocation against a captured pipeline-description JSON | [`## run`](#run) step 2 | The analyze JSON and visualize mermaid render without error; the captured config is the only input. |
| Snapshot a live Flow pipeline (online read-only) | The documented online-mode invocation against a JSON config naming `network.server_uds` and the scope | [`## run`](#run) step 3 | The dumper CSV, analyze JSON, and visualize mermaid land in the `outputs_directory`; live Flow state is not changed. |
| Diff two captured tune sessions | `scripts/flow_json_diff.py` and `scripts/flow_mermaid_diff.py` from the shipped `scripts/` directory | [`## test`](#test) step 5 | The diff scripts produce a structural and counter diff that the agent quotes verbatim; never paraphrased. |
| Post-process the dumper CSV | `scripts/hw_counters_csv_analyzer.py` from the shipped `scripts/` directory | [`## run`](#run) step 5 | The analyzer reports per-counter statistics over the captured CSV; the agent quotes the analyzer's output. |
| Save a session snapshot for debug | Capture the full `outputs_directory` (CSV + JSON + mermaid + log files) plus the four-tuple of (cmd line, JSON config, DOCA version, device, env) | [`## test`](#test) step 1 + [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug) | The saved bundle is consumed by the cross-cutting debug ladder as the Flow-side evidence pair. |

Three cross-cutting rules for this appendix:

- **Never invent a `doca_flow_tune` flag, mode name, JSON
  config field name, or recommendation identifier.** `--help` on
  the installed binary plus the public DOCA Flow Tune guide via
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA tools`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-tools)
  plus the shipped `flow_tune_cfg*.json` templates on the user's
  install are the joint contract.
- **Smoke before bulk.** Every row presumes the offline smoke or
  the online read-only smoke succeeded first; a state-changing
  application of a recommendation without the smoke is the
  canonical dataplane-disruption failure mode.
- **Cross-link instead of duplicate.** Cross-cutting commands
  (`pkg-config --modversion`, `doca_caps --list-devs`, `dmesg`)
  live in [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## Command appendix`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md);
  Flow-application-side build / port / pipe commands live in
  [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## Command appendix`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md);
  the perf-side measurement commands live in
  [`doca-flow-perf`](../doca-flow-perf/SKILL.md) and
  [`doca-flow-dpa-perf`](../doca-flow-dpa-perf/SKILL.md); this
  appendix names only `doca_flow_tune`-specific invocations on
  top.

## Cross-cutting

A few rules that apply across every verb in this file, restated
here so they are visible at the point of action and not buried
in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md):

- The **public DOCA Flow Tune guide** plus the installed
  `--help` plus the shipped `flow_tune_cfg*.json` templates are
  the joint source of truth. When they disagree (e.g. a field
  landed in a release this skill was not written against), the
  *installed* templates win for the user's actual session.
- `doca_flow_tune` *is* one binary with two internal roles.
  The agent must say which role a session uses (offline /
  online read-only / online state-changing) before invocation
  and must surface that there is no separate *"server package"*
  and *"client package"* to install.
- **Quote the four-tuple, not just the recommendation.** Command
  line + JSON config + DOCA version + device + as-deployed
  environment is the minimum unit a tune recommendation is
  meaningful in.
- The **state-changing application of a recommendation is
  high-stakes**; the agent must label every operation as
  read-only (offline / online read-only) or state-changing
  (online application of recommendation via Flow-program
  modify-a-sample) and gate every state-changing operation on
  a clean smoke per [`## test`](#test).
- This skill **assumes a healthy DOCA install** (or the public
  NGC DOCA container) and a working `doca-flow` application
  (or a captured configuration of one). If either is in doubt,
  route to
  [`doca-setup`](../../doca-setup/SKILL.md) and
  [`doca-flow`](../../libs/doca-flow/SKILL.md) before running
  anything else here. For baselines that the recommendations
  optimize on top of, load
  [`doca-flow-perf`](../doca-flow-perf/SKILL.md) and / or
  [`doca-flow-dpa-perf`](../doca-flow-dpa-perf/SKILL.md)
  alongside.
