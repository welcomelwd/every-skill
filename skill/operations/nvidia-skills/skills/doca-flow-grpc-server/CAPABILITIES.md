# DOCA Flow gRPC Server — Capabilities

**Where to start:** `doca_flow_grpc` is a remote-control
gRPC surface in front of `doca-flow`. The pattern overview below
names the recurring server-side questions. Pick the pattern
first, then drill into the H2 that owns the substance. For the
*how* of executing each pattern, jump to [TASKS.md](TASKS.md).
For the underlying `doca-flow` API the server's RPCs program, see
[`doca-flow CAPABILITIES.md`](../../libs/doca-flow/CAPABILITIES.md).

This file is loaded by [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). It documents *what
state the server exposes*, *how the gRPC contract is defined and
where the authoritative `.proto` files live*, *what transport
posture the external proxy / sidecar / VPN owns*, *which versions
it ships in*, *the layered error and observability surfaces*,
and *the safety policy that treats the endpoint as an admin
attack surface*.

## Pattern overview

Every `doca_flow_grpc` question this skill teaches
resolves into one of FIVE patterns. The patterns are CLASSES —
they apply across every doca-flow control-plane deployment, not
one specific application.

| `doca_flow_grpc` pattern | Class shape | Where the substance lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Decide remote-vs-direct | Is a remote gRPC control plane the right answer, or should the client just link `libdoca_flow.so` directly? The agent must surface the trade-off (network boundary, language barrier, deployment topology) instead of defaulting to gRPC because it sounds modern. | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) remote-vs-direct decision + [TASKS.md ## configure](TASKS.md#configure) |
| 2. Locate the `.proto` contract | The `.proto` files are the AUTHORITATIVE gRPC contract. **Monorepo layout:** the Flow gRPC `.proto` files live under `doca/libs/doca_flow/grpc/` (`common.proto`, `doca_flow.proto`, and `packet_buffering/packet_buffering.proto`) — NOT under `doca/tools/flow_grpc_server/`. **Binary install layout:** they are shipped via the doca-flow include / share path on the installed tree (`pkg-config doca-flow --variable=prefix` for the prefix; agent should confirm via `find <prefix> -name '*.proto'` on the user's install rather than assume a hard-coded path). Inventing RPC names or message field shapes from generic gRPC intuition is the canonical hallucination failure. | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) `.proto`-as-contract bullet + [TASKS.md ## configure](TASKS.md#configure) |
| 3. Pick external protection / network segment | The shipped server stays plaintext. TLS, identity, and access policy are provided only by a capable external proxy, sidecar, or VPN; the plaintext hop remains on a trusted isolated segment. Per the [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy), this is an admin attack surface. | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) external-protection bullet + [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy) |
| 4. Smoke-before-bulk | Start → bind → confirm one client (in the client language the operator actually plans to use) can traverse the external layer, issue one read-only RPC, and confirm the underlying Flow application is the one being programmed. THEN, and only then, expose the endpoint to additional clients or mutating RPCs. | [TASKS.md ## test](TASKS.md#test) + [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy) smoke-before-bulk rule |
| 5. Diagnose connect / RPC failures | Walk the layered error taxonomy in [`## Error taxonomy`](#error-taxonomy) — server-not-started / server-binding-failed / external-layer-rejected / RPC-call-error / Flow-precondition-failed / version / cross-cutting — for one diagnostic retry, then stop if it remains non-green. | [`## Error taxonomy`](#error-taxonomy) + [TASKS.md ## debug](TASKS.md#debug) |

Two cross-cutting rules that apply to *every* pattern above:

- **The `.proto` file is the contract.** Every concrete RPC
  name, message field name, and field type the agent quotes
  must come from the shipped `.proto` files on the user's
  installed version (or, equivalently, from the public DOCA
  Flow gRPC Server page on `docs.nvidia.com` for the same
  release). Inventing RPC names from generic gRPC patterns
  (*"`ListPipes`"*, *"`AddRule`"*) is the canonical
  hallucination failure for this skill.
- **State-changing RPCs are dataplane-affecting.** An RPC that
  creates / mutates / deletes pipes or entries does to Flow
  state exactly what a direct `libdoca_flow.so` call would
  do. The agent must label every RPC as read-only or
  state-changing and gate every state-changing RPC on a
  clean smoke per [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy).

## Capabilities and modes

`doca_flow_grpc` is a **single CLI binary built from the DOCA
source tree** (`executable('doca_flow_grpc', ..., install: false)`,
gated by `flag_enable_grpc_support`), plus the `.proto` files
under `libs/doca_flow/grpc/` that define its
gRPC contract and (per the shipped `packet_buffering/` and
`dpa_device/` source subtrees) optional companion components
for configurations that need packet buffering or DPA-side
helpers. The interaction model is *operator starts the
plaintext server with appropriate device + Flow + bind
configuration behind the external security layer; clients
dial through that layer and call the documented RPCs*.

### Remote-vs-direct decision

The first question the agent must surface before recommending
this tool at all.

| Surface | When to reach for it |
| --- | --- |
| Direct link to `libdoca_flow.so` in the controlling process (see [`doca-flow`](../../libs/doca-flow/SKILL.md)) | The controlling process is C / C++ and runs in the same address space (or the same host with shared libraries available); a network boundary is not required. |
| **`doca_flow_grpc`** (this skill) | The controlling process is in a different language than C / C++ (and language bindings are not available), OR runs on a different host / network segment from the BlueField / DPU, OR the deployment topology requires a centralized control plane addressing multiple BlueFields. |

The downstream rule: do not default to gRPC because it sounds
modern. A direct library link in the same process is simpler,
faster, and has a smaller attack surface; gRPC is the right
answer only when the deployment topology genuinely requires a
network boundary.

### The `.proto` file is the authoritative gRPC contract

The shipped DOCA install contains the `.proto` files that
define every RPC method, every request / response message, and
every field on the gRPC surface. Those files are the source of
truth on the user's installed version; nothing else (not a
public docs page snapshot, not agent memory, not a generic gRPC
pattern) is.

The agent's rule:

- Locate the `.proto` files on the user's install (under the
  tool's source tree shipped with DOCA; the exact path is
  install-specific and the agent should not invent it).
- Generate client stubs with the standard gRPC tooling for
  the client language — `protoc` plus the language-specific
  gRPC plugin per the [gRPC quickstart](https://grpc.io/docs/)
  index on `grpc.io`.
- Cite the `.proto` file when naming an RPC method or a
  message field; never quote a name from prose or memory.

### External security layer and network segment

> **CRITICAL (Run-12 + R13).** The shipped `doca_flow_grpc`
> binary hard-codes `grpc::InsecureServerCredentials()` (gRPC
> C++ **server-side** API); the C++ `doca_flow_grpc_client`
> binary hard-codes `grpc::InsecureChannelCredentials()` (gRPC
> C++ **client-side** API); the Python client uses
> `grpc.aio.insecure_channel(...)`. The substantive "no TLS / no
> mTLS / no token-auth" posture is identical across all three;
> the correct symbol name on the **server** side is
> `InsecureServerCredentials`, NOT `InsecureChannelCredentials`
> (a Grep against `tools/flow_grpc_server/server/` will return
> the server-side symbol). The "Auth" and
> "TLS" concerns are **NOT** in-binary knobs — there is no
> shipped flag, config file, env var, or build option that
> turns on TLS or mTLS or token-auth on this server today. The
> only sound posture is **plaintext-on-a-trusted-segment behind
> an external TLS/identity layer** (a TLS-terminating reverse
> proxy, a service mesh sidecar, a WireGuard tunnel, etc.).
> The decision the operator makes is therefore: *which external
> hardening layer* will gate this plaintext endpoint — NOT which
> in-binary auth/TLS knob to flip.

The operator must choose the external protection and the
network segment before exposing the endpoint:

| Decision | Operator's call | Constraint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **External protection** | A capable TLS / identity-enforcing proxy, service-mesh sidecar, or VPN | This layer owns certificates, tokens, client identity, and authorization. None are `doca_flow_grpc` binary knobs. |
| **Plaintext hop** | The path from the external layer to `doca_flow_grpc` | Must remain on a trusted isolated segment; do not expose it directly. |
| **Network segment** | Loopback, an internal management VLAN, or a control-plane-only subnet | The agent never invents an IP address or interface and never asserts an endpoint is safe on `0.0.0.0`. |

If only a subset of RPCs should be reachable, enforce that
subset in a capable external proxy that can inspect and allow
specific gRPC methods. The shipped binary provides no
per-method authorization knob; do not claim that it does.

### Language bindings

gRPC is a multi-language ecosystem. The languages the standard
gRPC tooling covers include — per the
[gRPC language support](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/) index on
`grpc.io` — C++, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, C#, Node.js, Android,
Objective-C, PHP, Dart, Kotlin, and (via community plugins) Rust.
For any of those languages, the client is generated by
`protoc` + the language-specific gRPC plugin from the shipped
`.proto` files; this skill does not pin a "supported language"
list of its own — the gRPC ecosystem's coverage is the contract.

### Optional companion components

Per the shipped source tree, the tool can be paired with two
optional companions:

- **packet_buffering/** — a packet-buffering helper for
  configurations that need it. Whether to enable it is a
  deployment-shape decision that depends on the surrounding
  Flow application's traffic pattern.
- **dpa_device/** — a DPA-side helper for configurations
  that involve DPA-offload paths on a DPA-capable device.
  Cross-references
  `doca-dpa` and
  [`doca-flow-dpa-perf`](../doca-flow-dpa-perf/SKILL.md) for
  the underlying DPA programming model and performance
  surface.

The exact configuration field names and CLI shape live on the
user's installed binary's `--help` plus the public DOCA Flow
gRPC Server page on `docs.nvidia.com`.

## Version compatibility

For the canonical DOCA version-detection chain, the four-way
match rule, NGC container semantics, and the headers-win-over-
docs rule, see [`doca-version`](../../doca-version/SKILL.md).
The body lives there; this skill does not duplicate it.

**The `doca_flow_grpc`-specific overlay** is:

- **The server rides the `doca-flow` library version it
  links against.** A `doca-flow` library `*.so` from one
  DOCA train paired with a gRPC server binary from another
  is a partial-install hazard per
  [`doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](../../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility).
  The four-way match per
  [`doca-version TASKS.md ## test`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#test)
  applies without modification.
- **The `.proto` contract is versioned with the DOCA install.**
  RPC method names, message fields, and field types can shift
  across DOCA releases. Clients generated from one release's
  `.proto` files cannot be assumed to work against a server
  binary from another release; if the contract changed, the
  client must be regenerated.
- **Where it runs.** The server runs on whichever side has the
  `doca-flow` library installed (host x86 / Arm, BlueField
  Arm, or NGC container with the Flow trace flavor present).
  The client can run anywhere with gRPC tooling for the
  client language plus network reachability to the server's
  endpoint.
- **gRPC ecosystem versioning is independent of DOCA's
  versioning.** Per the
  [gRPC versioning policy](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/)
  on `grpc.io`, the gRPC libraries themselves track their own
  versions; the agent's rule is *"use the gRPC library
  version your language ecosystem currently recommends, plus
  the `.proto` files from the user's DOCA install"*.

## Error taxonomy

`doca_flow_grpc`'s error surface is broader than a
local-only tool because the tool both serves remote clients and
exposes Flow state. The error layers the agent should
distinguish, in escalating order:

1. **Server-not-started.** The Flow setup is in place but
   the gRPC server process is not running. Cause: the
   operator did not start the binary, the binary crashed,
   or a precondition (Flow library missing, device not
   bound) blocked startup. Routing: confirm DOCA is
   installed via
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## configure`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#configure)
   and the Flow library is present per
   [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## test`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#test);
   confirm the binary's own logs.
2. **Server-binding-failed.** The init ran but the server
   could not bind the configured network address / port.
   Cause: another process holds the port, the configured
   address does not exist on the host, or the process lacks
   permission to bind it. Certificate and token failures
   belong to the external security layer, not this binary.
   The server's own error log is ground truth; do not
   guess. Routing: confirm the address / port against the
   operator's deployment config; route
   env-side issues to
   [`doca-setup ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug).
3. **External-layer-rejected.** The client did not traverse
   the selected proxy, sidecar, or VPN. Diagnose that layer
   using its own logs and configuration; do not map its
   certificate, token, or policy failures onto
   `doca_flow_grpc`, and do not suggest an in-binary fix.
4. **RPC-call-error.** The client traversed the external
   layer and issued an RPC, but the server returned a
   gRPC status code other than `OK`. The right move is to
   match the status code to the documented RPC contract in
   the `.proto` files — `INVALID_ARGUMENT` means the
   request message is malformed; `NOT_FOUND` means the
   requested pipe / entry does not exist; `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
   means a Flow-side precondition (pipe not created,
   validate-before-commit not performed) blocked the
   operation. Routing for the Flow-side preconditions:
   [`doca-flow TASKS.md ## modify`](../../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#modify)
   plus
   [`doca-flow CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](../../libs/doca-flow/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy).
5. **Flow-precondition-failed.** The RPC was syntactically
   valid but the underlying Flow application is not in a
   state to accept it (port not started, pipe not created,
   another mutation in flight). The right move is the
   doca-flow side, not the gRPC server side.
6. **Version.** Cross-cutting partial-install / mixed-
   version layer per
   [`doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](../../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility).
   Symptoms: the server's `.proto` contract does not match
   the client-side generated stubs (the client was
   generated from a different DOCA release's `.proto`);
   the server binary version disagrees with the Flow
   library version it links. Walk
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug)
   end-to-end.
7. **Cross-cutting.** All layers above are clean and the
   client still cannot use the server. The cause is below
   DOCA — driver, firmware, BlueField mode, network
   reachability, kernel-level firewall. Hand off to
   [`doca-debug ## debug`](../../doca-debug/SKILL.md) and
   [`doca-setup ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug).

The debug loop permits one diagnostic correction and one
retry. If the same request remains non-green after that retry,
stop, preserve the server log + client status + external-layer
log, and escalate; do not widen access or continue retrying.

The gRPC server itself uses the cross-library
`DOCA_ERROR_*` values when calling into `doca-flow`; the agent
maps those into the layers above before quoting them.

## Observability

`doca_flow_grpc` exposes three observability surfaces
the agent should consult, in order:

- **Server logs.** The binary's own log output (per
  `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL` and the standard DOCA logging surface; see
  [`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](../../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#observability))
  is the first source of truth for server-side errors.
  Bind start / bind failure / per-RPC accept and reject
  lines live here.
- **Client-side gRPC status codes.** Every failed RPC the
  client sees carries a standard gRPC status code per the
  [gRPC status codes](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/status-codes/)
  reference on `grpc.io`. The agent must quote the code
  (`UNAVAILABLE` / `UNAUTHENTICATED` / `INVALID_ARGUMENT` /
  `NOT_FOUND` / `FAILED_PRECONDITION` / etc.) verbatim;
  paraphrasing the code is the canonical lost-fidelity
  failure.
- **The live Flow application's observability surface.** Per
  [`doca-flow CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](../../libs/doca-flow/CAPABILITIES.md#observability),
  the Flow library exposes pipe / entry / counter / inspector
  state programmatically. When the gRPC RPC succeeds but the
  user's downstream behavior is wrong, this is where the
  diagnosis continues.

For the env-side counters that bound the deployment (link
state, PCIe, IB), reach for
[`doca-setup CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](../../doca-setup/CAPABILITIES.md#observability).

## Safety policy

> **Overlay on the bundle-wide hardware-safety meta-policy.** The rules below are this skill's per-artifact overlay on the cross-cutting rules in [`doca-hardware-safety` CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy](../../doca-hardware-safety/CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy) (specifically [### Per-artifact overlay pattern](../../doca-hardware-safety/CAPABILITIES.md#per-artifact-overlay-pattern)). When the two layers disagree, the stricter wins; when either layer says STOP, the agent stops.

Exposing `doca_flow_grpc` in production is a
**deliberately high-stakes posture** — it is an admin attack
surface attached to the dataplane:

- **Treat the endpoint as a privileged surface.** Bind it on
  a trusted segment (loopback, an internal management VLAN, a
  control-plane-only subnet) behind a capable external proxy,
  sidecar, or VPN that enforces TLS and identity before any
  client beyond a local smoke client. The shipped binary
  remains plaintext behind that layer. Recommend the
  operator confirm *who can reach the endpoint* before
  declaring it exposed.
- **Transport security is external only.** The proxy,
  sidecar, or VPN owns TLS, identity, and any RPC-subset
  policy. `doca_flow_grpc` exposes no certificate, token,
  TLS, or per-method authorization configuration.
- **Smoke-before-bulk is mandatory.** Before pointing a fleet
  of clients (or any production client) at the server, the
  agent runs the start → bind → one-client-smoke → read-only-
  RPC sequence in [`TASKS.md ## test`](TASKS.md#test). A
  server exposed without that sequence is a guess against a
  possibly-unbound endpoint, a possibly-misconfigured
  external protection layer, or a possibly-mismatched
  contract.
- **State-changing RPCs are dataplane-affecting.** Every RPC
  that creates / mutates / deletes pipes or entries does to
  Flow state exactly what a direct `libdoca_flow.so` call
  would do. The agent must label every RPC as read-only or
  state-changing and must NOT issue a state-changing RPC
  before a clean read-only smoke.
- **Never widen access as a workaround.** If a client cannot
  reach the server or an RPC is rejected, walk
  [`## Error taxonomy`](#error-taxonomy) once and retry once;
  then stop and escalate if still non-green. Do not bypass
  the external layer or widen the bind address to `0.0.0.0`.
- **Do not invent RPC names, message field names, or
  endpoint paths.** The shipped `.proto` files on the user's
  installed version are the contract; prose-derived names
  are the most common hallucination failure for this skill.

## Public-source pointer

The single canonical public source for `doca_flow_grpc`
is the **DOCA Flow gRPC Server** page on `docs.nvidia.com`,
reachable through
[`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA tools`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-tools).
The second authoritative source on the user's install is the
shipped `.proto` file set under the tool's source tree. For
generic gRPC ecosystem documentation (auth, status codes,
language bindings, versioning), the canonical source is
[`grpc.io`](https://grpc.io/) — the public DOCA Flow gRPC
Server page does not duplicate that ecosystem documentation.
For the `doca-flow` API the server programs, see
[`doca-flow`](../../libs/doca-flow/SKILL.md) plus the public
DOCA Flow guide reached the same way.
