- Skill: `nemo-relay-debug-runtime-integration`
- Evaluation date: 2026-07-30
- Evaluator version: `0.9.2`
- Agents: Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`), Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`)
- Tasks: 4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative)
- Dataset digest: `sha256:6c296a04671b2c4dbcf71cd6635b53ccd7fdef8405ea55c6ba6de51d66a3f0e2` (skill-evaluator-dataset-snapshot/1)

Each task attempt ran in its own isolated sandbox pod.

## What This Report Answers

The three-tier evaluation checks whether the skill:

- is safe to use;
- produces correct answers;
- is discovered and activated when needed;
- helps the agent complete the user's goal and expected workflow; and
- avoids wasted skill and tool usage.

## Results at a Glance

| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 73% → 98% (+26 points) | 71% → 94% (+22 points) |
| Security | 100% → 100% (±0 points) | 75% → 100% (+25 points) |
| Correctness | 85% → 100% (+15 points) | 100% → 100% (±0 points) |
| Discoverability | 62% → 100% (+38 points) | 61% → 95% (+34 points) |
| Effectiveness | 76% → 95% (+19 points) | 88% → 90% (+2 points) |
| Efficiency | 40% → 96% (+56 points) | 32% → 83% (+51 points) |

**How to read this table:** baseline is the same task attempted without the target skill. Uplift is `skill score - baseline score`, shown in percentage points.

Example: `47% → 92% (+45 points)` means the skill-assisted run scored 92%, 45 percentage points above its 47% no-skill baseline.

## Scoring Methodology

<details>
<summary>Show dimension definitions, source signals, and thresholds</summary>

| Dimension | Question | Scored signals |
|---|---|---|
| Security | Is it safe to use? | `security` (100%) |
| Correctness | Is the answer correct? | `accuracy` (100%) |
| Discoverability | Was the right skill loaded when needed? | `skill_execution` (100%) |
| Effectiveness | Did the skill help complete the task? | `goal_accuracy` (50%) + `behavior_check` (50%) |
| Efficiency | Did it avoid wasted tool or skill usage? | `skill_efficiency` (100%) |

- Dimension bands: PASS at 50% or above; NEUTRAL from 40% to below 50%; FAIL below 40%.
- Overall Tier 3 lift: PASS at +5 points or more; FAIL at -10 points or less; values between those bands are NEUTRAL.
- Overall verdict: PASS only when every configured dimension passes for at least one supported agent. Lift is reported as diagnostic evidence and does not override this gate.
- The 50% attempt pass threshold is a separate per-task gate; it is not the dimension pass threshold.
- Effectiveness is the equal-weight mean of goal completion (`goal_accuracy`) and expected workflow adherence (`behavior_check`).
- Token efficiency is a separate report-only signal. It does not change a dimension score or the overall verdict.

Signals present in this run:

- `security` (Security): unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access.
- `skill_execution` (Skill Execution): whether the expected skill was found and executed.
- `skill_efficiency` (Efficiency): routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use.
- `accuracy` (Accuracy): final-answer correctness against the reference answer.
- `goal_accuracy` (Goal Accuracy): whether the user's goal was achieved.
- `behavior_check` (Behavior Check): whether the expected workflow behavior was followed.
