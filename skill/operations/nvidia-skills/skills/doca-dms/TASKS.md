# DOCA Management Service — Tasks

**Where to start:** The order is `configure → build → modify → run →
test → debug`. The `## test` verb is an iterative loop, not a
one-shot pass — see the eval-loop overlay in `## test` below. For DMS,
`build` and `modify` are about *daemon configuration* (SystemD unit,
flags, YANG-instance fragments), not about compiling source.

These verbs cover the in-scope DMS operational workflows for an
external operator deploying and using DMS. Every step assumes the
operator has consulted the live public DMS guide on `docs.nvidia.com`
and is using it as the authoritative reference; this file prescribes
the *order* and *what to look up where*, not a copy-paste runbook.
If the version-matched live guide is unavailable, inspect the
installed `dmsd --help`, SystemD unit, and installed documentation.
If none is available for the installed release, stop and report the
version/source gap; do not fall back to remembered flags or paths.

## configure

Preparing the management endpoint and choosing a deployment shape.

1. **Confirm the env is healthy first.** This skill expects DOCA to be
   installed at the management endpoint (host, BlueField Arm, or pod
   image base). If that has not been verified, run
   [`doca-setup ## test`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#test) first. If
   the user has no install yet, route to
   [`doca-setup ## no-install`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install)
   for the public NGC DOCA container path. Do not return until the
   `doca-setup ## test` install/version, capability, and smoke checks
   are green for the management endpoint; run that check once. If it
   errors or cannot complete under its documented timeout, abort the
   DMS workflow and route the captured result to
   `doca-setup ## debug`; do not retry from this skill. A package merely being
   present is not sufficient.
2. **Identify the deployment shape.** Read the public DMS guide's
   "Service Deployment" section and map the user's situation to one of
   the documented shapes (Host non-DPU / BlueField Arm / Kubernetes
   pod). Each shape has its own "Prerequisites" subsection — read it
   before any further step.
3. **Identify the management protocol scope.** Confirm whether the
   user needs gNMI (data configuration), gNOI (system operations), or
   both. gNMI Subscribe streaming IS supported (`STREAM` with `SAMPLE`
   1s–60s and `ONCE`; only `POLL` / `Aggregation` are Unimplemented per
   `gnxi/gnmi/server.go`). For a turnkey, productized
   telemetry-aggregation surface separate from DMS's own gNMI
   Subscribe, route to the DOCA Telemetry Service (DTS) instead.
4. **Plan the authentication mode.** Choose one of the four
   documented modes (localhost-only / PAM / credentials / mTLS) and
   read the *Security Best Practices* subsection before committing.
   Localhost-only is for development only and must not be exposed.
   Record the bind scope, credential/certificate source, server trust
   policy, client-auth requirement, and `-allowed_users` behavior from
   the live guide; reject a plan that weakens any of those compared
   with the matching documented recipe.
5. **Plan user authorization.** Identify the human/service users who
   will issue DMS commands over gRPC and ensure they are in the
   `-allowed_users` list (default `root`; enforced by `isUserAllowed`
   in `gnxi/utils/credentials/credentials.go`). The `dmsgroup` Unix
   group is a separate, `dmspe`-only gate — add a user to it only if
   they also need to invoke the `dmspe` privileged helper directly on
   the endpoint.

## build

DMS is a service, not a library. There is no DMS *application*
artifact for the operator to build — the daemon (`dmsd`/`dmspe`) ships
with the DOCA install, and clients are standard gNMI/gNOI tooling that
the operator already has.

If the user is asking how to build a **gNMI/gNOI client** in their own
language, the right routing is:

- **C / C++** — generic gRPC + gNMI/gNOI client patterns. Outside DMS
  scope. The DMS-specific contribution is the path inventory and the
  operation list documented in `CAPABILITIES.md ## gNMI client surface`
  and `## gNOI client surface`.
- **Other languages (Go / Python / Rust / …)** — same answer. Use
  the standard gNMI/gNOI client libraries for that language; DMS does
  not author wrappers and does not maintain language-specific clients.

If the user is instead asking about building **a DOCA application** in
the general sense (linking against `libdoca-*`), that is *not* a DMS
question — route them to
[`doca-programming-guide ## build`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#build)
and the matching `libs/<library>` skill.

## modify

DMS does not have a "modify a sample" workflow analogous to DOCA
libraries; there is no DMS sample program a user starts from. The
DMS analog of "modify" is **adapt the documented launch / auth /
deployment recipe to the user's environment**:

1. **Start from the documented recipe.** Identify the public guide's
   recipe that matches the user's deployment shape and authentication
   mode. Quote it; do not author a new one.
2. **Diff against the user's environment.** Note the specific
   substitutions the user must make: hostnames, certificate paths,
   `allowed_users` lists for PAM mode, port assignments,
   network-exposure decisions.
3. **Apply minimum-change.** Change only what the user's environment
   forces. Every additional deviation from the documented recipe
   widens the surface for an unintended exposure.
4. **Re-validate against the Security Best Practices subsection.**
   Each substitution is a chance to accidentally weaken the documented
   posture. Re-check the five recorded controls from configure step 4:
   bind scope, secret/certificate source, server trust, client auth,
   and `-allowed_users`. Any unapproved widening (for example binding
   localhost-only mode to `0.0.0.0`) is a stop condition.

## run

Bringing up `dmsd` and exercising it.

1. **Decide SystemD vs manual launch.** SystemD is the documented
   recommended path for production. Manual launch is appropriate for
   bring-up, debugging, and walking the documented advanced
   configurations.
2. **Apply the documented launch flags.** Flag inventory lives under
   "DMS Server Flags (`dmsd`)" in the public guide, partitioned into
   General & Provisioning / Authentication & Security / Authentication
   Method / Security flag families. Quote flags from the live guide;
   do not infer flags from generic gRPC knowledge.
3. **Verify the daemon is reachable.** Use a documented gNMI `Get`
   against a known-supported State path as a connectivity probe.
   "Documented" matters: a `Get` against an unsupported path returns
   an error from `dmsd` regardless of whether the daemon is healthy.
4. **Verify authorization works as expected.** Confirm a user in the
   `-allowed_users` list can issue gRPC commands and a user outside it
   cannot. If the test fails, the failure is at the authorization
   layer, not the protocol layer — see `## debug` step 2.
5. **Issue the user's first real `Set` against a documented path.**
   Then `Get` the corresponding State path to confirm the change
   landed. The `Set` / `Get` pattern across Configuration vs State
   branches is the documented validation idiom.

For gNOI operations: read the operation's documented sub-operation
list first, then issue. Operations like `OS install`, `Reboot`, and
`Factory-reset` change the managed device state in non-trivial ways —
the operator should know which sub-operation they are invoking and
why.

> **⚠️ Destructive and irreversible — confirm before issuing.** `OS
> install`, `Reboot`, `Factory-reset`, and managed-file deletion are service-impacting and
> cannot be undone: they can take a production BlueField or ConnectX
> offline or wipe its configuration. Before issuing any of them the
> agent MUST (1) verify the target device identity and (2) obtain
> authorization bound to that target and action: an explicit user reply
> in an interactive session or an approved-system authorization artifact
> in unattended execution. Otherwise stop with `confirmation_required`. Never issue them
> speculatively or as an implicit side effect of another task.

## test

DMS has no "compile and unit-test" workflow — testing is operational.

**`## test` is a bounded iterative loop, not a one-shot pass.** Every
configuration mutation (auth mode, listener, `-allowed_users`
membership, persistency setting) re-opens the smoke sweep. Skipping the re-run
after a mutation is the failure mode this loop replaces. Permit one
mutation-and-rerun cycle total per test invocation, regardless of which
back-edge or failure class consumes it. If the second sweep reveals any
failure, including a different failure class, do not take another
back-edge. Return a diagnostic bundle to the operator containing all
smoke results, collected debug-layer outputs, and the capability
snapshot when step 4 completed; otherwise state that the snapshot was
not reached. Mark the result `requires_human_decision` instead of
iterating again or invoking another skill automatically.

**Green criteria:** the daemon returns the expected shape for a
documented `Get`; the configured auth mode rejects the documented
negative request (or, for localhost-only mode, the listener is
loopback-only and unreachable remotely); the required isolated
persistency probe survives restart and
is rolled back; and the capability snapshot matches the selected
deployment shape.

The eval-loop overlay (rows apply to every DMS deployment, not just one
topology):

| Step | Why this is a loop, not a step | Where the substance lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 → ## modify → 1 | Capability-snapshot drift often reveals an as-deployed gap that needs a configuration change; apply the minimum documented recipe change in `## modify`, then restart the test sweep at step 1 | [`## test`](#test) step 4 |
| 2 → ## debug | When the auth-mode smoke does NOT reject what it should, the deployment is unsafe — escalate to `## debug` immediately, do not run later steps | [`## debug`](#debug) |
| 3 → ## run step 2 → 1 | When persistency does not survive restart, re-check the documented persistency launch flag/state-file configuration in `## run` step 2, then restart the test sweep at step 1 | [`## run`](#run) step 2 |
| 1..4 → ## run | Each loop iteration ends with a documented smoke; if all four pass, hand off to live `## run` traffic | [`## run`](#run) |

The agent's rule: every mutation re-opens the sweep. A
configuration change followed by "it probably still works" is exactly
the failure mode the iterative loop is here to prevent.

The destructive-operation gate remains active inside both `## test`
and `## debug`: no OS install, reboot, factory reset, or managed-file
deletion may be used as a probe or recovery action without re-verifying the exact target and
obtaining confirmation for that specific operation.

1. **Smoke-test the daemon.** After launch (`## run` step 3), confirm
   the daemon answers a documented gNMI `Get` and returns expected
   shape.
2. **Smoke-test the auth mode.** For credentialed modes, confirm the
   chosen mode rejects unauthenticated/unauthorized requests as documented.
   For mTLS, this means an explicit "request without cert is
   rejected" check. For PAM, this means an "user not in `allowed_users`
   is rejected" check. Localhost-only has no authentication: its
   negative test is that `dmsd` is bound only to loopback and cannot be
   reached through a non-loopback interface.
3. **Smoke-test persistency only on an isolated test path.** If the
   deployment relies on persistency, have the operator select a
   documented, reversible path on a test-only interface/instance,
   snapshot its current value, set a distinct test value, restart
   `dmsd`, verify the value survives, then restore and verify the
   snapshot. If no isolated reversible path exists, skip the mutation
   and mark persistency `not_tested`; when persistency is required this
   keeps the sweep not-green and blocks completion. Never improvise a
   "benign" value on production state.
4. **Capability snapshot.** Save the *as-deployed* answer to: which
   gNMI paths your environment supports, which gNOI operations your
   environment supports, which auth mode is active, who is in the
   `-allowed_users` list. This snapshot is the artifact that lets
   future debug sessions skip rediscovery.

## debug

Layered diagnosis. Walk the layers in this order; do not skip down
without clearing the layer above.

1. **Transport layer.** Is the gRPC channel even reaching `dmsd`?
   Symptoms: `UNAVAILABLE`, `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, TLS handshake
   failures. Causes: wrong host/port, firewall, daemon not running,
   TLS material misconfigured. Resolution: confirm `dmsd` is running
   (SystemD status or process list), confirm the listener address
   matches the client's target, confirm TLS material if mTLS mode is
   in use.
2. **Authentication / authorization layer.** Symptoms:
   `UNAUTHENTICATED`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, "user not authorized".
   Causes: wrong credentials, user not in the `-allowed_users` list
   (applies to ALL auth modes, enforced by `isUserAllowed`),
   certificate issuer not trusted by `dmsd`. Resolution: walk the
   documented authentication-mode troubleshooting in the public guide
   for the specific mode in use.
3. **Path / operation layer.** Symptoms: `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, "path
   not found", "operation not supported". Causes: the path is not in
   the DMS-supported set, the operation is not in the documented
   gNOI list, or an unsupported gNMI Subscribe MODE was attempted
   (`POLL` / `Aggregation` are Unimplemented; `STREAM` / `SAMPLE`
   1s–60s and `ONCE` ARE supported).
   Resolution: re-read the supported-paths reference and the gNOI
   operation list in `CAPABILITIES.md`. If the path or operation is
   genuinely not in the public set, the answer is "not supported" —
   not "invent a workaround".
4. **Backend / underlying-tool layer.** Symptoms: the operation
   reached `dmspe` and the underlying tool (e.g. `mlxconfig`, OS
   installer, file system) returned an error. Resolution: extract
   the underlying-tool error from the response and consult that
   tool's own documentation. Preserve the raw gRPC status code,
   message, and documented details fields verbatim. If the selected
   release documents no nested error field, capture the complete
   sanitized response and stop rather than guessing which substring
   belongs to the backend. Return that response as the diagnostic
   artifact and mark the diagnosis blocked pending the underlying
   tool's documentation. DMS is the conduit, not the source of truth
   for the underlying tool's failures.
5. **State persistency layer.** Symptoms: a previously-set value
   does not survive a daemon restart. Resolution: confirm automatic
   recording is enabled (it can be disabled per the docs), confirm
   the configuration-persistency file is writable and not being
   overwritten by an external process, then consult the documented
   state restoration mechanism.
6. **Library-level errors.** If DMS is acting as a thin wrapper over
   a DOCA library call and that library returned `DOCA_ERROR_*`, the
   relevant cross-library taxonomy lives in
   [`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](../../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy).
   The library-specific overlay (e.g. for Flow) lives in the
   matching `libs/<library>` skill.

## Command appendix

DMS-specific commands the verbs above reach for, grouped by purpose
so the agent picks the right family without searching prose. Every
row is a class — the agent must not invent flags beyond what the row
names; flag discovery is `--help` on the installed binary or the
SystemD unit file, not prose recall.

| Purpose | Command (class shape) | Owning step | Reads as healthy when … |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Daemon lifecycle (SystemD) | `systemctl status dmsd` / `start` / `stop` / `restart` | [`## run`](#run) | `active (running)` with no recent restart loops. |
| Daemon launch (manual) | `dmsd --help` first, then the documented flag set | [`## run`](#run) | Daemon binds the documented listener and emits the expected startup banner. |
| Daemon logs (frontend) | `journalctl -u dmsd --since "5 min ago"` or the documented log file | [`## debug`](#debug) layer Transport/Auth | Lines present for the request window; no auth-rejection storm. |
| Daemon logs (backend) | The documented `dmspe` log destination | [`## debug`](#debug) layer Backend | Backend execution lines present; tool stderr captured. |
| Sanity gNMI Get | A gNMI `Get` on a path copied verbatim from the installed/public DMS guide for this release; do not substitute a generic OpenConfig example | [`## test`](#test) step 1 | Returns the expected typed value. |
| Sanity gNMI Set | A gNMI `Set` on a documented, reversible path selected by the operator on a test-only interface/instance; snapshot first, then restore and verify as in test step 3 | [`## test`](#test) step 3 | Returns success; subsequent `Get` reflects the test value, then the restored snapshot. |
| gNOI sanity (read-only) | A gNOI `System.Time` (or equivalent read-only op the guide lists) | [`## test`](#test) step 1 | Returns the expected time / status. |
| Auth-mode negative test | Credentialed mode: request without credentials. Localhost-only: connection attempt through a non-loopback interface | [`## test`](#test) step 2 | Credentialed mode rejects as documented; localhost-only is unreachable off loopback. |
| Persistency check | Set a value, restart `dmsd`, re-`Get` | [`## test`](#test) step 3 | The previously set value survives the restart. |
| Capability snapshot | A documented gNMI `Get` enumerating supported paths / ops | [`## test`](#test) step 4 | Output matches the deployment-shape capability matrix. |
| Cross-cutting health | `ss -tlnp \| grep dmsd` (port listener), `ps -ef \| grep dmsd` | [`## debug`](#debug) layer Transport | Daemon listens on the documented port; one `dmsd` process. |

Three cross-cutting rules for this appendix:

- **Never invent a DMS flag.** The public guide is the contract;
  `dmsd --help` against the installed binary is the only secondary
  source. Prose-derived flags are the most common hallucination
  failure for this skill.
- **Frontend logs before backend logs.** When triaging, read
  `journalctl -u dmsd` (or the documented frontend log) first; only
  drop to `dmspe` once the frontend confirms the request reached the
  backend.
- **Cross-link instead of duplicate.** Cross-cutting commands (the
  read-only triple, `dmesg`, `mlxconfig -d <pcie> q`) live in
  [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## Command appendix`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#command-appendix);
  this appendix names only the DMS-specific ones.

## Deferred task verbs

- **Installing DOCA on the management endpoint** — out of scope here.
  Route to [`doca-setup ## configure`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure)
  for env preparation and
  [`doca-setup ## test`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#test) for install
  health verification, or
  [`doca-setup ## no-install`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install)
  for the public NGC DOCA container Path 0 if there is no DOCA install
  yet.
- **Building a custom DOCA application** — not a DMS question. Route
  to [`doca-programming-guide ## build`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#build)
  for the canonical build pattern, plus the matching `libs/<library>`
  skill for the API surface.
- **Turnkey telemetry aggregation** — out of scope for DMS. DMS's own
  gNMI Subscribe DOES stream (`STREAM` / `SAMPLE` 1s–60s and `ONCE`;
  only `POLL` / `Aggregation` are Unimplemented); for a productized
  telemetry-aggregation surface, route to the DOCA Telemetry Service
  (DTS), discoverable through
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).
- **Library-internal API questions** (Flow pipe construction, RDMA
  queue setup, …) — outside DMS. Route to the matching
  `libs/<library>` skill.

## Cross-cutting

- The public DMS guide is the single source of truth. Any flag,
  path, operation, or auth-mode detail the agent quotes must come
  from there, not from generic gNMI / gNOI / gRPC knowledge.
- DMS is currently **beta** with GA scoped to SPC-X use cases. Treat
  any "what is the long-term roadmap" question as out of scope and
  defer to the live public guide.
- Localhost-only auth is **never** safe to expose externally.
- All operational guidance must preserve the documented two-process
  separation (`dmsd` low-priv frontend, `dmspe` privileged backend).
- For URL routing to the DMS guide and other public DOCA documentation,
  see [doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services).
