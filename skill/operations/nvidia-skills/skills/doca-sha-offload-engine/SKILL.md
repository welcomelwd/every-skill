  Use this skill when wiring the DOCA SHA Offload Engine

# DOCA SHA Offload Engine

**Where to start:** This is a tool skill for the OpenSSL
ENGINE shipped in the DOCA SOURCE tree under
`doca/tools/sha_offload_engine/` and INSTALLED on the host
under `${DOCA_DIR}/tools/doca_sha_offload_engine/` as
`libdoca_sha_offload_engine.so`. The directory-name shift
(`sha_offload_engine` in the source layout vs
`doca_sha_offload_engine` in the install layout) is an
NVIDIA packaging convention, not a bundle inconsistency;
both forms appear below and are the same artifact at
different lifecycle stages — quote whichever the prompt is
about (build-from-source vs runtime-load). It is **not a CLI** —
it is a shared object loaded by an OpenSSL-based
application or by `openssl` itself, that re-routes SHA-1 /
SHA-256 / SHA-512 (one-shot only, via the `EVP_Digest`
interface) onto the DOCA SHA hardware path. Open
[`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md) and start at
[`## configure`](TASKS.md#configure) for the PCIe-address
configuration and the OpenSSL prerequisites; jump to
[`## run`](TASKS.md#run) for the *"load the engine and
prove it actually runs"* flow. Open
[`CAPABILITIES.md`](CAPABILITIES.md) when the question is
*what the engine actually offloads vs falls back to*,
*when the engine is a perf win vs not*, or *how to verify
offload actually engaged*. If DOCA is not installed yet,
route to [`doca-setup`](../../doca-setup/SKILL.md) first.
If the user is building a new SHA pipeline from scratch
(not wrapping an existing OpenSSL-based one), this skill
is the wrong surface — route to
[`../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md`](../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md)
instead.

## Example questions this skill answers well

The CLASSES of `doca-sha-offload-engine` questions this
skill is built to answer, each with one worked example.
The class is the load-bearing piece; the worked example
is one instance.

- **"I have an existing OpenSSL-based pipeline doing SHA;
  can I offload the SHA to DOCA without rewriting the
  app?"** — worked example: *"the app uses
  `EVP_DigestInit_ex` / `EVP_DigestUpdate` /
  `EVP_DigestFinal_ex` against `EVP_sha256()`; can I
  drop in DOCA-SHA offload via an engine load?"*.
  Answered by the *"when this engine is the right
  surface"* rule in
  [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
  + the engine-load mechanics in
  [`TASKS.md ## configure`](TASKS.md#configure).
- **"Did the engine actually load? Or did OpenSSL just
  fall back to software SHA?"** — worked example: *"my
  `openssl dgst` invocation completed; how do I know
  DOCA SHA actually did the work and OpenSSL did not
  silently use the software path?"*. Answered by the
  *"prove the engine actually ran"* pattern in
  [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](CAPABILITIES.md#observability)
  (the SHA-224 negative test and the `-engine_impl`
  flag) + the verification flow in
  [`TASKS.md ## test`](TASKS.md#test).
- **"For what message-size range is the engine offload a
  win vs CPU SHA?"** — worked example: *"my pipeline
  hashes 4 KB blocks at a time; is the engine a win
  there, or does the round-trip to DOCA SHA cost more
  than the CPU hash itself?"*. Answered by the
  message-size-window rule in
  [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
  + the `openssl speed` perf-comparison pattern in
  [`TASKS.md ## test`](TASKS.md#test).
- **"What SHA algorithms does the engine actually
  support — and what happens for the ones it does not?"**
  — worked example: *"my pipeline mixes SHA-1, SHA-256,
  SHA-512, and SHA-224 — what does the engine do for
  each?"*. Answered by the algorithm-coverage matrix in
  [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes).
- **"Should I use this engine, or call doca-sha
  directly?"** — worked example: *"I am writing a new
  service from scratch; does the engine save me work or
  does it add complexity I do not need?"*. Answered by
  the *"engine vs library"* selection table in
  [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes).
- **"What OpenSSL versions does the engine require, and
  what about OpenSSL 3.x's deprecation of the ENGINE
  API?"** — worked example: *"my host has OpenSSL 3.0;
  will the engine still load?"*. Answered by the version
  overlay in
  [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility)
  (verified surface: the engine is documented for
  OpenSSL 1.1.1f on Ubuntu 20.04 and OpenSSL 3.0.2 on
  Ubuntu 22.04 per the shipped `readme.md`).

## Audience

This skill serves **external developers and operators who
have an existing OpenSSL-based pipeline doing SHA hashing
and want to offload SHA onto DOCA SHA without rewriting
their application against the doca-sha C API**.
Concretely:

- A developer integrating DOCA SHA acceleration into a
  service that already uses `EVP_Digest` for SHA-1 /
  SHA-256 / SHA-512.
- An operator deploying an `openssl dgst` / `openssl
  speed` based pipeline and wanting to measure the win
  from DOCA SHA offload without changing the pipeline's
  invocation surface.
- An SRE / performance engineer producing a *"this is
  the engine-offload win vs CPU SHA on this message-size
  mix"* artifact to inform a code-change decision (e.g.
  *"should we adopt the engine as-is, or rewrite to
  doca-sha for finer control?"*).
- An AI agent answering *"can I drop DOCA SHA into this
  OpenSSL-based app without code changes"* honestly —
  with the verified algorithm-coverage matrix, the
  message-size window, and the verification pattern that
  proves the engine actually ran.

It is **not** for users building a new SHA pipeline from
scratch (route to
[`../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md`](../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md)),
**not** for users wanting MD5 / SHA-2-224 / SHA-3 /
HMAC-SHA offload (the engine does not implement those —
the verified surface per the engine's source is one-shot
SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 via `EVP_Digest`), and **not** a
substitute for the public DOCA SHA programming guide.

## Language scope

The DOCA SHA Offload Engine is shipped as a **C dynamic
shared object** (`libdoca_sha_offload_engine.so`) built
from `doca/tools/sha_offload_engine/{engine/doca_sha_offload_engine.c,
lib/doca_sha_offload_lib.{c,h}}` via `meson`. Its
*consumer* interface is OpenSSL's ENGINE API; any
language that calls OpenSSL (C, C++, Rust via `openssl`
crate, Python via `cryptography` and `pyca/cryptography`'s
backend, Node via `node:crypto`) can therefore *use* the
engine, provided the language binding either calls
`ENGINE_load_dynamic` / `ENGINE_by_id` directly or honors
an OpenSSL `engines` config that loads it. The skill's
language-neutral contribution is the engine-load mechanics
and the verification pattern; the OpenSSL ENGINE API is
the contract.

## When to load this skill

Load this skill when the user is — or the agent needs to
— deploy the DOCA SHA Offload Engine into an OpenSSL-based
pipeline on a host with DOCA installed and a SHA-capable
device. Concretely:

- Wiring the engine into an existing OpenSSL-based
  application or `openssl` CLI invocation, with the
  intent of no source-level code changes (or only the
  minimum `ENGINE_load_dynamic` / `ENGINE_by_id` block
  shown in the verified `readme.md`).
- Verifying the engine actually engaged for the
  hot-path digests (the *"is offload real or did OpenSSL
  fall back to software"* question).
- Characterizing the message-size range over which the
  engine is a perf win vs the CPU `sha1` / `sha256` /
  `sha512` paths.
- Deciding between *"adopt the engine"* (existing
  pipeline, minimal change) and *"rewrite to doca-sha"*
  (new pipeline, fine-grained control needed).

Do **not** load this skill for users building a new
SHA-pipeline from scratch — route to
[`../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md`](../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md).
Do not load this skill for users wanting algorithms the
engine does not implement (MD5, SHA-3, SHA-224, HMAC-SHA,
streaming/incremental SHA via `EVP_DigestUpdate` chains
that the engine treats as one-shot only).

## What this skill provides

This is a **thin loader**. Substantive material lives in
two companion files:

- `CAPABILITIES.md` — what the engine offloads (verified:
  one-shot SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512 via the OpenSSL
  `EVP_Digest` high-level interface), what it does NOT
  offload (anything else — including SHA-224, MD5,
  SHA-3, HMAC-SHA, and any chained
  `EVP_DigestInit_ex` / `EVP_DigestUpdate` /
  `EVP_DigestFinal_ex` pattern that the engine implements
  by buffering and then calling DOCA SHA in one shot at
  `Final`), the engine-vs-library selection rule, the
  message-size-window rule for when offload is a perf
  win, the verified ctrl-cmd surface (`set_pci_addr`),
  the version overlay (OpenSSL ≥ 1.1.1; the engine's
  shipped tests cover OpenSSL 1.1.1f and OpenSSL 3.0.2
  per the `readme.md`; OpenSSL 3.x deprecates the ENGINE
  API but still supports it via the legacy code path),
  the layered error taxonomy, the observability surface
  (the *"prove offload engaged"* pattern using the
  SHA-224 negative test and `-engine_impl`), and the
  safety overlay.
- `TASKS.md` — step-by-step workflows for the in-scope
  task verbs: `install`, `configure` (PCIe address
  selection — the engine defaults to `03:00.0` and
  exposes the `set_pci_addr` ctrl-cmd plus a build-time
  override per the shipped `test_cmdline_mode/readme.md`),
  `build` (the `meson` flow), `modify` (refuses source
  patching; modify the load-time invocation and the
  PCIe address instead), `run` (load the engine via
  `openssl engine dynamic`; the verification pattern;
  the OpenSSL programmatic `ENGINE_load_dynamic` block),
  `test` (the *"prove the engine ran"* SHA-224 negative
  test; the `openssl speed` perf comparison; the
  message-size window characterization), `debug` (walk
  the error taxonomy layer by layer), `use` (the
  engine-vs-library decision for the user's specific
  pipeline), plus a `Deferred task verbs` block.

The skill assumes a host where DOCA is already installed,
OpenSSL ≥ 1.1.1 is present (`libssl-dev` or equivalent),
and the deploying user can access the selected DOCA SHA PCIe device. Verify
device visibility and run the engine-load smoke as that same user before
integration; if either fails with a permission error, stop and route to
`doca-setup` rather than guessing a group, ACL, or `sudo` policy.

## What this skill deliberately does not ship

This skill is **agent guidance**, not a samples or
scripts bundle. It deliberately does not contain — and
pull requests should not add:

- **Pre-written OpenSSL ENGINE application source code**
  beyond the verbatim verified block in the shipped
  `readme.md` (the `ENGINE_load_dynamic` /
  `ENGINE_by_id` / `ENGINE_ctrl_cmd_string` /
  `ENGINE_init` / `ENGINE_set_default_digests` sequence,
  cross-referenced into [`TASKS.md ## run`](TASKS.md#run)).
  The shipped readme is the worked example.
- **A `samples/`, `bindings/`, or `reference/`
  subtree.** This is a thin loader for a shipped
  shared-object; substantive material lives in the
  shipped `readme.md` and the doca-sha library docs.
- **Performance numbers from agent memory.** The
  message-size-window where the engine wins is
  device-, firmware-, OpenSSL-version-, and
  workload-specific. The `openssl speed` comparison
  pattern in [`TASKS.md ## test`](TASKS.md#test) is the
  way to capture it on the user's actual hardware;
  quoting a number from memory is the cross-platform
  failure mode this skill exists to prevent.
- **Wrappers, parsers, or scripts** in any language
  that consume the engine's stdout or the `openssl
  speed` output format.

## Loading order

1. Read this `SKILL.md` first to confirm the user's
   question is in scope (the user actually has an
   existing OpenSSL-based pipeline and wants to offload
   to DOCA SHA *without* code changes; if the user is
   building from scratch, route to
   [`../../libs/doca-sha/`](../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md)).
2. **For what the engine offloads vs falls back, the
   engine-vs-library selection rule, the message-size-
   window rule, the version overlay, the error taxonomy,
   the observability surface (and the prove-offload-
   actually-engaged pattern), and the safety overlay,
   see [CAPABILITIES.md](CAPABILITIES.md).**
3. **For step-by-step workflows — `install`,
   `configure`, `build`, `modify`, `run`, `test`,
   `debug`, `use` — see [TASKS.md](TASKS.md).**

## Related skills

- [`../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md`](../../libs/doca-sha/SKILL.md) —
  the underlying DOCA SHA library. The engine is a
  thin OpenSSL-ENGINE wrapper around doca-sha; when the
  user needs fine-grained control over the SHA task
  surface (partial-hash, custom buffer permissions,
  cap-query for unusual message sizes), the library is
  the right answer. The engine wraps the *one-shot*
  task; the library exposes both one-shot and partial-
  hash per
  [`../../libs/doca-sha/CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes`](../../libs/doca-sha/CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes).
- [`doca-version`](../../doca-version/SKILL.md) — the
  canonical version-detection chain. The engine has a
  TWO-axis version overlay (DOCA-side and OpenSSL-side);
  the version skill carries the four-way match rule
  this skill layers on top of.
- [`doca-debug`](../../doca-debug/SKILL.md) — the
  cross-cutting debug ladder. The engine surfaces its
  own error taxonomy; when the cause is below DOCA
  (driver, firmware), the taxonomy hands off here.
- [`doca-setup`](../../doca-setup/SKILL.md) — env
  preparation, install verification, the `libssl-dev`
  install path, and the NGC DOCA container path.
- [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md) —
  routing to the public DOCA SHA documentation set on
  `docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/` and to the OpenSSL
  ENGINE / `openssl-engine` upstream documentation on
  `openssl.org`.
- [`doca-hardware-safety`](../../doca-hardware-safety/SKILL.md) —
  the bundle-wide hardware-safety meta-policy. The
  engine binds to a specific PCIe device; the
  `set_pci_addr` ctrl is the artifact-specific overlay,
  but any host-side change underneath (firmware burn,
  BFB reflash) runs through the meta-policy.
