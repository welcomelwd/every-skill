# DOCA BlueField-4 deployment — Tasks

**Where to start:** The executable bring-up path is `configure -> run ->
test -> debug`. The lint-required `build` and `modify` anchors below
are routing stubs reached only when the user asks those questions —
they are not steps in BF4 day-1 bring-up. There is no application
artifact to build or sample to modify in a platform bring-up; those
questions live in the application-deployment skills and
[`doca-programming-guide`](../doca-programming-guide/SKILL.md). This
skill owns getting a bare BlueField-4 to a Grace OS installed and
firmware at the target level, driven from the BMC. The `## test` verb
is the post-install / post-update verification sweep.

These verbs cover the in-scope BF4-bring-up workflows for an external
operator standing up a new BlueField-4 through its BMC. Every step
assumes the operator has consulted the live public BlueField/DOCA
documentation and release notes (reachable through
[`doca-public-knowledge-map ## Public documentation entry points`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#public-documentation-entry-points))
and the Redfish / PLDM / UEFI standards; this file prescribes the
*order* and *what to look up where*, not a copy-paste runbook. Every
MUTATING step (PLDM burn, ISO reflash, power cycle, BMC factory reset)
loads [`doca-hardware-safety`](../doca-hardware-safety/SKILL.md)
ALONGSIDE.

## configure

Preparing to bring up the BlueField-4 and confirming every
precondition BEFORE any boot, transfer, or burn.

1. **Confirm out-of-band BMC reachability.** The whole flow is driven
   from the BMC. Confirm BMC SSH works ({bmc-user} / {bmc-password},
   supplied by the operator — never invented), and that the DPU's OOB
   serial console is reachable via `obmc-console-client`. Without an
   OOB path the bar for proceeding is "stop, establish OOB first" per
   [`doca-hardware-safety ## Out-of-band access classes`](../doca-hardware-safety/CAPABILITIES.md#out-of-band-access-classes).
2. **Host the ISO.** Download the BlueField/DOCA bundle ISO (and, for
   the Grace-Ubuntu path, the Grace Ubuntu image and any cloud-init
   config ISO) from the public NVIDIA download surface, and host it at
   {iso-uri} on your own HTTP/HTTPS server. For a remote HTTPS source
   used by Redfish Virtual Media, confirm it allows unauthenticated
   access, supports HTTP `HEAD`, and that the BMC has the server
   certificate in its truststore using the BMC's documented
   certificate-store query. If trust cannot be verified, stop before
   transfer; do not improvise certificate-install commands.
3. **Pick the install method.** Per the install-method table in
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes):
   UEFI HTTP Boot (recommended — fewest moving parts), PXE Boot (when
   you already have DHCP+TFTP or need a custom `bf.cfg`), or Redfish
   Virtual Media (fully out-of-band; needs a recent dpu-bmc version).
   For Virtual Media, read the installed dpu-bmc version from the
   documented Redfish/BMC inventory surface and compare it with the
   minimum in the current public BF4 deployment guide. If either value
   is unavailable, do not use Virtual Media; choose UEFI HTTP Boot or
   PXE when one fits. If Virtual Media is mandatory, stop and escalate
   the missing version evidence rather than assuming support.
   The choice feeds [`## run`](#run). If local BMC-eMMC Virtual Media
   is selected, preflight the combined local payload and stop if it
   exceeds 5 GB. For Grace Ubuntu, also record that the BMC-facing
   URIs must be exactly `image.iso` and `config.iso`.
4. **Capture the target versions.** Read the target bundle-ISO build,
   NIC firmware level, and SBIOS / ERoT / BMC component versions from
   the **public BlueField/DOCA release notes** (route via
   [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md)).
   Do NOT quote a pre-release firmware version from memory; record the
   release-notes targets as the verification baseline used in
   [`## test`](#test).
5. **Plan the rollback and the maintenance window.** Every burn /
   reflash / power cycle is MUTATING. Capture the pre-change state
   (current FirmwareInventory, current `/etc/mlnx-release` if Grace is
   already up), agree a maintenance window, and confirm the OOB path
   survives a failed change — all per
   [`doca-hardware-safety ## modify`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#modify),
   loaded ALONGSIDE.
6. **Select optional branches explicitly.** Decide from the public
   release notes whether this bring-up requires the
   [`### pldm-firmware-update`](#pldm-firmware-update) branch, and
   decide whether the target is the
   [`### grace-ubuntu-cloud-init`](#grace-ubuntu-cloud-init) branch.
   Do not infer either branch from hardware generation alone.
7. **Resolve action inputs.** Before entering any mutating sub-step,
   confirm that every placeholder required by that action has a
   concrete, operator-supplied or live-discovered value. Stop before
   an upload, attach, burn, reset, or power cycle if any required
   credential, URI, image, EID, or task ID is unresolved.

## build

BF4 platform bring-up has **no application artifact to build**. The
binaries, service containers, and DOCA libraries a workload uses are
not built here.

- If the user is asking how to build a DOCA-linked binary or a service
  to deploy once Grace is up, route to
  [`doca-programming-guide ## build`](../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#build),
  then to
  [`doca-bare-metal-deployment`](../doca-bare-metal-deployment/SKILL.md)
  or
  [`doca-container-deployment`](../doca-container-deployment/SKILL.md)
  to deploy it.
- If the user is asking how to assemble the bundle ISO or the
  firmware `.fwpkg` themselves, that is NVIDIA-internal release
  engineering — out of scope. The operator downloads the published
  artifacts from the public NVIDIA download surface.
- The H2 stays so the verb order is intact; the answer is *there is no
  build step in platform bring-up — you download published artifacts
  and install them.*

## modify

BF4 platform bring-up has **no "modify a sample program" workflow**.
The bring-up analog of "modify" is **re-walking the bring-up after a
change**, and any change to firmware *configuration* leaves this verb:

1. **A firmware-config change is a hardware-state change.** Adjusting
   NV-config / mode toggles (e.g. via `mlxconfig set`) or burning new
   firmware is MUTATING and is owned by
   [`doca-hardware-safety ## modify`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#modify);
   this skill does not redefine that discipline. Control returns to
   [`## configure`](#configure) once the change is complete and
   verified.
2. **A re-install or re-flash is a fresh bring-up.** Re-pointing the
   boot path at a new ISO, or re-pushing a `.fwpkg`, re-opens the
   verification sweep — re-walk [`## run`](#run) then
   [`## test`](#test).
3. **A change to the cloud-init seed is a fresh Grace-Ubuntu install.**
   Editing the CIDATA seed means re-attaching `config.iso` and
   re-installing; re-walk
   [`### grace-ubuntu-cloud-init`](#grace-ubuntu-cloud-init).
4. **Modifying a workload's source belongs elsewhere.** Source changes
   to a DOCA application route to
   [`doca-programming-guide ## modify`](../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#modify);
   they are not a platform-bring-up concern.
5. The H2 stays for verb-order parity; the substantive routing is
   above.

## run

Bringing the BlueField-4 up: install the bundle ISO onto Grace via the
chosen method, update platform firmware via PLDM when required, and
(optionally) install a Grace Ubuntu image with cloud-init. Each
sub-anchor below is one documented flow. Reach the OOB console via BMC
SSH + `obmc-console-client` before starting any of them, and load
[`doca-hardware-safety`](../doca-hardware-safety/SKILL.md) ALONGSIDE.
The bundle-ISO methods and the Grace-Ubuntu path are alternative OS
targets selected in [`## configure`](#configure); run one OS-install
path. The PLDM firmware-update branch may accompany either when the
release notes require it.
Before **each** mutating upload, attach, burn, reset, or power cycle,
show that exact action and blast radius and obtain confirmation for
that specific action. After confirmation, resume only the sub-step
that triggered the gate; one confirmation never authorizes later
mutations.

### method-a-uefi-http-boot

The recommended OS-install method — no PXE / DHCP / TFTP needed.

1. Host the bundle ISO at {iso-uri} on your HTTP server.
2. Reach the DPU OOB console via BMC SSH + `obmc-console-client`.
3. Reboot Grace and enter UEFI.
4. Go Device Manager -> Network Device List -> select the OOB MAC ->
   HTTP Boot Configuration -> set the Boot URI to {iso-uri} -> save.
5. Go Boot Manager -> select the UEFI HTTP entry -> boot the
   installer.
6. Watch the install on the OOB console; then do the shared
   post-install in [`### post-install`](#post-install).

### method-b-pxe

Use when you already have PXE infrastructure or need a custom `bf.cfg`.

1. Stand up / confirm a PXE server: DHCP + TFTP + the ISO.
2. Reach the DPU OOB console via BMC SSH + `obmc-console-client`.
3. In Boot Manager, set next boot to the OOB IPv4 net device.
4. Select the DOCA arm64 menu, then the ISO, and boot the installer.
5. Watch the install on the OOB console; then do
   [`### post-install`](#post-install).

### method-c-redfish-virtual-media

Fully out-of-band; needs a recent dpu-bmc version. No physical access.

1. If uploading to local BMC eMMC, verify the combined local payload
   is no more than 5 GB; otherwise stop and use remote hosting. Then
   show the exact upload and blast radius, obtain confirmation for
   this upload, and use the Redfish SimpleUpdate API.
2. Attach it via Redfish VirtualMedia; Grace then sees USB
   mass-storage devices. Confirm the media reports `"Inserted": true`.
3. Set BootSourceOverride to USB (Once / UEFI).
4. Reset Grace; monitor via `obmc-console-client`.
5. Do [`### post-install`](#post-install), and **detach the media**
   when done.

### pldm-firmware-update

Update BMC / NIC firmware / SBIOS / ERoT via PLDM over Redfish. Every
step here is MUTATING — `doca-hardware-safety` is loaded ALONGSIDE.

1. **NIC firmware from the host (only when explicitly required).**
   Use the host-side `flint` path only when the public release notes
   for the selected bundle explicitly require it; otherwise skip this
   step rather than guessing. When required, program from the host and
   power cycle. Route each mutation through
   [`doca-hardware-safety ## modify`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#modify).
2. **Push the bundle.** Upload the `.fwpkg` ({fw-image}) via a Redfish
   multipart `POST` to the UpdateService update-multipart endpoint.
3. **Monitor the Task.** Poll the returned Task ({task-id}):
   `TaskState` Running -> Completed, `PercentComplete` to 100; a
   `Messages` Exception or a non-Completed terminal state is failure
   (drop to [`## debug`](#debug) layer 3). Use the Task's documented
   retry/timeout guidance when present. Otherwise, classify it as
   stalled when `TaskState`, `PercentComplete`, and `Messages` are
   unchanged across two consecutive observations at an
   operator-approved polling interval; approval means an explicit
   interval value for this Task. Those are the only two
   observations permitted. If no interval is approved, do not poll:
   stop with `confirmation_required`, ask the operator to approve an
   interval, and remain stopped until one is supplied. In either case
   there is no open-ended polling loop.
4. **Verify pending images.** `pldmtool fw_update GetFwParams -m
   {eid}` and compare `ActiveComponentVersionString` against
   `PendingComponentVersionString` per component — Pending differs
   from Active before activation.
5. **Activate.** Show the exact power-cycle action and blast radius
   and obtain separate confirmation (e.g. `ipmitool power cycle`);
   re-run GetFwParams and confirm Active now equals the release-notes
   target. Do not add a BMC factory reset as a generic "clean state"
   step; perform one only when a version-matched public recovery
   procedure explicitly requires it and the operator requests and
   separately confirms that exact reset.

### grace-ubuntu-cloud-init

Install a Grace Ubuntu image (optionally seeded by cloud-init) via
Redfish Virtual Media.

1. **Prepare the cloud-init seed (optional).** Build the seed as an
   ISO with volume label `CIDATA`.
2. **Choose hosting and preflight it.** Local — calculate the image
   plus seed size before transfer and proceed only when it is no more
   than 5 GB combined on BMC eMMC. Remote — host on an HTTPS server that allows
   unauthenticated access and supports HTTP `HEAD`, with the server
   certificate in the BMC truststore.
3. **Transfer + attach.** For each action, show the exact transfer or
   attach and blast radius and obtain action-specific confirmation;
   then transfer via Redfish SimpleUpdate and attach via Redfish
   VirtualMedia. The URIs are fixed to `image.iso` and
   `config.iso` — original filenames do not matter. Confirm
   `"Inserted": true`.
4. **Boot.** Show and separately confirm the boot-state change and
   reset with their blast radii. Set BootSourceOverride to USB and
   reset Grace, OR
   manually pick the OpenBMC Virtual Media Device from the UEFI Boot
   Manager.
5. **Verify + detach.** Verify the installed OS build from Grace,
   verify the expected cloud-init user/key/hostname when a seed was
   supplied, and cross-check component versions via Redfish
   FirmwareInventory. Then eject / detach and confirm
   `"Inserted": false`. **Never eject mid-install.**

### post-install

Shared across every OS-install method:

1. First login with the image's **documented default credentials**,
   then **immediately change them**.
2. Set a strong root password.
3. Validate the installed build with `cat /etc/mlnx-release`.
4. **Detach all virtual media** (Method C / Grace-Ubuntu) to avoid a
   boot loop; confirm `"Inserted": false`.
5. Hand off to [`## test`](#test) for the full verification sweep.

## test

BF4 bring-up has no compile-and-unit-test workflow — verification is
operational against the BMC and Grace. **`## test` is the sweep run
after every install or firmware change**; skipping it after a change
is the failure mode this verb replaces.

Run each check that applies to the path performed. A PLDM-only update
requires checks 2, 3, and 6; OS, Virtual Media, and cloud-init checks
apply only when those paths were performed.

1. **OS install took (OS-install paths only).** `cat
   /etc/mlnx-release` on Grace reports the release-notes target build
   string, and the OOB console shows a clean boot to a login prompt.
   Default credentials have been changed.
2. **Firmware update took.** The Redfish Task reported `TaskState`
   Completed with `PercentComplete` 100 and no Exception; after the
   activation power cycle, `pldmtool fw_update GetFwParams -m {eid}`
   shows Active equal to the target (Pending cleared) for every
   updated component.
3. **Versions match the release notes.** The Redfish FirmwareInventory
   per-component versions equal the targets captured in
   [`## configure`](#configure) step 4 — not an assumed value. Compare
   it with `pldmtool GetFwParams` from step 2; if they disagree,
   re-query both sources once. If they still disagree, stop and
   escalate to the operator with both values, the OOB-console
   evidence, and the bring-up snapshot for manual adjudication; do
   not choose one or declare success.
4. **Virtual media detached (Virtual Media paths only).** Any Virtual
   Media resource reports `"Inserted": false`, and Grace does not
   re-enter the installer on a subsequent reset (no boot loop).
5. **Cloud-init applied (Grace-Ubuntu path only).** The customization
   from the CIDATA seed (user, SSH key, hostname) is present on the
   booted Grace OS.
6. **Capture the bring-up snapshot.** Record which method was used,
   the install build string, the per-component firmware versions, and
   the OOB-console / Task evidence — the artifact that lets a later
   debug session skip rediscovery and is the rollback baseline.

If any check fails, drop to [`## debug`](#debug) at the matching
layer; do not declare the bring-up complete on a single green signal.

## debug

Layered diagnosis. Walk the layers in this order; do not skip down
without clearing the layer above. The six layers match
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy).

1. **Boot-source layer.** ISO never starts: UEFI HTTP Boot cannot
   fetch the Boot URI, the PXE menu never appears, or the Virtual
   Media device is absent from the Boot Manager. Confirm {iso-uri} is
   reachable from the OOB network and serves the ISO; confirm the OOB
   MAC matches the Network Device List entry; (Method C) confirm the
   media was attached before the reset. Evidence: the OOB console via
   `obmc-console-client`.
2. **Virtual-media-attach layer.** InsertMedia fails or
   `"Inserted": false`; Grace sees no USB mass-storage device. Check
   the dpu-bmc version supports Redfish Virtual Media; confirm the
   SimpleUpdate transfer completed (Method C local) or that the remote
   HTTPS source allows unauthenticated access, supports HTTP `HEAD`,
   and has its certificate in the BMC truststore; confirm the combined
   local payload is within 5 GB.
3. **Firmware-Task layer.** The multipart `POST` was accepted but the
   Task stays Running, ends with an Exception, or stalls
   `PercentComplete`. Read the Task `Messages`; verify the `.fwpkg`
   is the correct, uncorrupted bundle and targets present components;
   do NOT re-push or power-cycle blindly. If the Task remains stalled,
   capture the complete Task resource and `Messages`, stop this
   workflow, and escalate with the bring-up snapshot and OOB-console
   evidence. Any recovery that re-burns, resets, or power-cycles MUST
   be planned through `doca-hardware-safety` and separately confirmed
   by the operator — a stalled firmware Task is HIGH-STAKES per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy`](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy).
4. **Activation layer.** `pldmtool fw_update GetFwParams -m {eid}`
   still shows Pending differing from Active after the Task completed:
   identify that the component needs a power cycle, but do not treat
   it as a non-mutating debug correction. Stop this sweep, route the
   exact power cycle through `doca-hardware-safety`, obtain separate
   operator confirmation, and resume at [`## test`](#test) only after
   the approved action.
5. **Cloud-init layer (Grace-Ubuntu).** The OS installed but the
   cloud-init seed did not apply: confirm the seed ISO volume label is
   exactly `CIDATA` and that both `image.iso` and `config.iso` were
   attached under their fixed URIs.
6. **Boot-loop layer.** Grace re-enters the installer / Virtual Media
   on every reset: the install media was never detached. Detach all
   virtual media, confirm `"Inserted": false`, and clear / re-point
   the boot override. This is the most common day-1 self-inflicted
   loop.

For any cross-cutting host-side issue on the machine that talks to the
BF4 (kernel, drivers, PCIe link state), drop to
[`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug). For any
mutating recovery action (re-burn, reflash, factory reset), route to
[`doca-hardware-safety`](../doca-hardware-safety/SKILL.md).

**Debug-loop bound.** Walk the six-layer sweep once, apply at most one
evidence-backed, non-mutating correction: the exact failed observed
value must map to an explicit read-only/configuration remedy written
in that same numbered layer above; no inferred or cross-layer remedy
qualifies. Then re-run
[`## test`](#test).
If the same layer remains non-green, STOP and escalate with the bring-up
snapshot, Task resource and `Messages`, `pldmtool` output, and OOB-console
capture. Do not start another sweep or improvise a mutating recovery.
The activation-layer power cycle is a separately confirmed mutating
recovery, does not consume this non-mutating correction, and resumes at
`## test` rather than continuing the debug sweep. If that single
post-action test is not green, stop and escalate; do not re-enter
debug or request another power cycle.

## Deferred task verbs

- **BlueField-3 (BF3) bring-up** — out of scope here. This skill is
  BlueField-4-specific (Grace, the dpu-bmc Redfish surface, the BF4
  install methods). Route to `doca-bf3-deployment`.
- **Running an application on an already-working BlueField** —
  out of scope. A DOCA service container routes to
  [`doca-container-deployment`](../doca-container-deployment/SKILL.md);
  a DOCA-linked binary launched directly routes to
  [`doca-bare-metal-deployment`](../doca-bare-metal-deployment/SKILL.md).
  This skill hands off once Grace is installed and firmware is at the
  target level.
- **Library-API questions** (constructing a DOCA-Flow pipe, an RDMA
  queue pair, interpreting a `DOCA_ERROR_*` code) — out of scope.
  Route to the matching `libs/<library>` skill via
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## Library- and module-specific guides`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#library--and-module-specific-guides).
- **Env preparation on the installed Grace OS** (hugepages,
  `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` / `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, devlink mode, representor
  visibility) — out of scope here. Route to
  [`doca-setup ## configure`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure); this
  skill stops at "Grace installed, firmware at target."
- **The hardware-change meta-policy itself** (preflight, OOB-console
  discipline, maintenance window, rollback for any PLDM burn / ISO
  reflash / power cycle / BMC factory reset) — owned by
  [`doca-hardware-safety ## modify`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#modify).
  This skill always loads it ALONGSIDE and adds only the BF4
  sequencing; it never redefines the meta-policy.
- **Fleet-scale / orchestrated DPU provisioning** (DOCA Platform
  Framework, NVIDIA Network Operator) — out of scope per the bundle's
  non-goals. Route via
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## Externally-productized DOCA software`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#externally-productized-doca-software--not-in-this-bundle-but-here-is-where-to-route).
