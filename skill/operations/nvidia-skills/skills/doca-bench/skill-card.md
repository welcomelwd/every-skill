## Description: <br>
Run doca_bench (DOCA 2.7.0 or newer) to measure throughput, bulk latency, precision latency, or maximum bandwidth for RDMA, Compress, AES-GCM, SHA, DMA, EC, Ethernet, Comch, or GPUNetIO on a host or BlueField Arm. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers who need a reproducible, vendor-supported way to measure DOCA library performance on their actual install and device, including baseline capture, regression testing, and cross-library throughput comparison. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 4 evaluation tasks (3 positive skill-activation, 1 negative). <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies that the agent loaded the expected skill and workflow. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Checks routing quality, decoy avoidance, and redundant tool usage. <br>
- `accuracy`: Grades final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Checks whether the overall user task completed successfully. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies expected behavior steps, including safety expectations. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) | Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | 4 | 100% (+0%) | 100% (+0%) |
| Correctness | 4 | 100% (+25%) | 100% (+20%) |
| Discoverability | 4 | 97% (+34%) | 95% (+45%) |
| Effectiveness | 4 | 100% (+81%) | 86% (+44%) |
| Efficiency | 4 | 91% (+37%) | 78% (+53%) |
