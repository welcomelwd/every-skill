# DOCA Verbs workflows

**Where to start:** The verbs run `configure → build → modify → run
→ test → debug`. EVERY workflow below begins by re-confirming the
drop-down decision in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) — if the matching
higher-level DOCA library ([`doca-rdma`](../doca-rdma/SKILL.md) /
[`doca-eth`](../doca-eth/SKILL.md) /
[`doca-rmax`](../doca-rmax/SKILL.md)) covers the user's case, the
right answer is to stop and climb back up, not to walk these verbs.
The `## test` verb is an iterative loop (smoke → narrow → loop back
if the WR-flag set, QP feature set, or completion path changed),
not a one-shot pass.

Read this file when the loader sent you here from
[SKILL.md](SKILL.md). For the higher-level-library-vs-doca-verbs
split, the libibverbs-vs-doca-verbs boundary, the verbs object
model, capability discovery, error taxonomy, observability, and
safety policy that these workflows assume, see
[CAPABILITIES.md](CAPABILITIES.md). For the foundation primitives
(`doca_dev`, `doca_pe`, `doca_ctx`, `doca_mmap`, `doca_buf`,
`doca_log`) every verbs context rests on, see
[`doca-common`](../doca-common/SKILL.md). For the cross-library
DOCA patterns layered under everything below (the universal
lifecycle, the cross-library `DOCA_ERROR_*` taxonomy, the
modify-a-shipped-sample workflow), see
[`doca-programming-guide`](../../doca-programming-guide/SKILL.md).

Each verb below describes the **shape of the workflow**, not a
copy-paste recipe. The agent's job is to walk the user through the
steps in order, verifying preconditions before recommending the
next call.

## install

DOCA Verbs is part of the standard DOCA host install — installing
`doca-verbs` in isolation is not a thing. The install verb routes
to [`doca-setup`](../../doca-setup/SKILL.md) for the env / install
chain, and to
[`doca-public-knowledge-map ## Layout of an installed DOCA package`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#layout-of-an-installed-doca-package)
for the on-disk layout the rest of this file assumes.

The agent's checks before declaring the install ready for any
raw-verbs work:

1. **`pkg-config --modversion doca-verbs` returns a semver
   string** — if the query fails, the verbs library is not
   installed on this host. Route to
   [`doca-setup ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug) layer 1
   (install).
2. **`pkg-config --modversion doca-common` agrees** with the
   `doca-verbs` version per the four-way match rule in
   [`doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](../../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility).
   A verbs-only upgrade against an older `doca-common` install is
   a partial-install hazard.
3. **The verbs headers are resolvable** under
   $(pkg-config --variable=includedir doca-common) (`doca_verbs.h`
   plus the adjacent `doca_verbs_*.h` family) per the
   headers-win-over-docs rule in
   [`doca-version`](../../doca-version/SKILL.md).
4. **The selected workload has a usable device.** For RDMA-class
   QP workloads, `ibv_devinfo` (with sudo) returns at least one
   device row with `state: PORT_ACTIVE`, the same precondition as
   [`doca-rdma`](../doca-rdma/SKILL.md). For Ethernet-SQ/RQ
   workloads, `doca_caps --list-devs` returns the selected
   Ethernet-capable `doca_dev`; its exact queue feature is then
   gated by the device-level query in `## configure` step 5.

If any of the four checks fails, **stop** — this skill's workflows
assume the install is healthy, and a partial install is a
[`doca-setup`](../../doca-setup/SKILL.md) concern.

## configure

Goal: bring up a `doca-verbs` context on a host or BlueField, with
a QP / CQ / PD / MR / SRQ / AH set the user has explicitly chosen,
*after* confirming the drop-down decision is correct.

Steps the agent should walk the user through:

1. **Re-confirm drop-down.** Ask: *"have you confirmed the matching
   higher-level DOCA library ([`doca-rdma`](../doca-rdma/SKILL.md)
   for RDMA work, [`doca-eth`](../doca-eth/SKILL.md) for Ethernet
   queues, [`doca-rmax`](../doca-rmax/SKILL.md) for timing-precise
   media) does not expose the verb / opcode / WR flag / QP
   attribute / SRQ option / CC-group hint / Ethernet-queue option
   you need?"* If no — stop, route back. If yes — ask the user to
   name the specific thing the higher-level surface does not
   cover; that name is the load-bearing input for steps 4 and 5.
   This step is the cheapest place to catch the *"recommended raw
   verbs unnecessarily"* failure mode.
2. **Read the verbs symbols from the user's install.** The
   `doca_verbs_*` symbol surface is install-bound (and shipped
   under the experimental ABI tier on this release); the agent
   must not quote symbols from memory. Direct the user to
   $(pkg-config --variable=includedir doca-common) for the verbs
   headers and to `ls /opt/mellanox/doca/samples/` for the
   shipped samples that demonstrate the live API. Per
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility](CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility),
   the headers win over the docs when they disagree.
3. **Confirm the installed DOCA version.** Use the procedure in
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## configure`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#configure).
   Quote the version observed (`pkg-config --modversion
   doca-verbs` AND `pkg-config --modversion doca-common`, both
   matching `doca_caps --version`); do not assume "latest". A
   verbs-only upgrade against an older `doca-common` install is a
   partial-install hazard per
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility](CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility).
4. **Bring up the doca-common foundation FIRST.** Walk the
   universal foundation skeleton in
   [`doca-common TASKS.md ## use`](../doca-common/TASKS.md#use):
   `doca_devinfo_create_list` → pick devinfo → `doca_dev_open` →
   `doca_pe_create`. Without this foundation in place, the
   verbs-layer steps below have nothing to attach to.
5. **Capability-query the SPECIFIC verb / option the user named
   in step 1.** Call `doca_verbs_query_device(devinfo, &dev_attr)`
   and inspect the matching `doca_verbs_device_attr_get_*` for
   what the user wants — `_get_is_qp_type_supported` for the QP
   type; `_get_max_qp_wr` / `_get_max_sge` / `_get_max_inline_data`
   for QP sizing; `_get_is_ece_supported`,
   `_get_is_cc_group_supported`, `_get_is_cqe_inline_supported`,
   `_get_is_ordering_semantic_supported`,
   `_get_is_send_dbr_mode_supported`,
   `_get_is_dpa_external_datapath_supported`,
   `_get_is_gpu_external_datapath_supported` for the feature
   flags; the Ethernet-queue family
   (`_get_max_eth_sq_wr_num`, `_get_max_eth_rq_wr_num`,
   `_get_is_eth_sq_ts_source_type_supported`,
   `_get_is_eth_rq_ts_source_type_supported`,
   `_get_is_eth_rq_srq_supported`,
   `_get_is_allow_multi_pkt_send_wqe_supported`,
   `_get_is_plane_index_supported`) when the user is dropping to
   doca-verbs for an Ethernet-queue case. If the relevant flag is
   false (or the max is zero) — that is the answer. The user's
   device / firmware / DOCA version does not support what they
   wanted, and dropping to raw verbs cannot manufacture support
   that the cap-query denies. Climb back up to the matching
   higher-level library if it covers a viable alternative. **Free
   the handle** with `doca_verbs_device_attr_free` after
   snapshotting.
6. **Sketch the verbs object set BEFORE any code.** Which
   `doca_verbs_context`? Which `doca_verbs_pd`? Which
   `doca_verbs_qp`(s), with which feature set (transport type,
   QP type, ECE / CC-group / CQE-inline / ordering-semantic
   choices)? Which `doca_verbs_cq`(s), with which
   completion-handling path (DOCA progress engine vs manual
   `doca_verbs_bridge_poll_cq` vs comp-channel event delivery —
   pick one explicitly per
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability](CAPABILITIES.md#observability))?
   Which `doca_verbs_srq`(s)? Which `doca_verbs_ah_attr` for IB
   or RoCE routing? Which MR(s) covering which memory? If any of
   those are unclear, stop and ask — do not invent.
7. **Configure the verbs context.** Walk the universal Core
   lifecycle (`cfg-create → cfg-set-* → init → start → use →
   stop → destroy`, per
   [`doca-common CAPABILITIES.md ## ctx`](../doca-common/CAPABILITIES.md#ctx));
   apply the verbs-specific setters in the order the headers
   require. The high-level shape is:
   `doca_verbs_context_create(dev, &ctx)` → `doca_verbs_pd_create(ctx, &pd)`
   → if selected, `doca_verbs_comp_channel_create(ctx, &chan)` and
   `doca_verbs_cq_attr_set_comp_channel` on the CQ attributes →
   CQ init-attr / create → QP init-attr / create →
   `doca_pe_connect_ctx(pe, ctx_as_doca_ctx)` BEFORE
   `doca_ctx_start` → drive the QP state machine via
   `doca_verbs_qp_modify(qp, qp_attr)` through the transitions
   the QP type requires. Per the no-mixing rule in
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy),
   do not pull any `ibv_*` handle into this context.
8. **Sanity check before any WR submission.** Confirm with the
   user: which QP, which CQ it reports to, which MR(s) the WR
   will reference, which WR opcode + flags. If any of those are
   unclear, stop and ask — raw verbs amplifies the cost of
   guessed parameters.

If any step fails with a `DOCA_ERROR_*`, route through the error
taxonomy in
[CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
before retrying.

## build

Goal: produce a binary that links `doca-verbs` against the user's
installed DOCA, using the canonical cross-library build pattern.

The build pattern for any DOCA C/C++ consumer is **identical**
across libraries — `pkg-config` for include + link flags, meson
or CMake as the build system — and is fully documented in
[`doca-programming-guide TASKS.md ## build`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#build).
This skill carries only the raw-verbs-specific overlay:

| Slot | Value for doca-verbs | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pkg-config` module name | `doca-verbs` (NOT `doca-rdma`; NOT `libibverbs`; NOT `doca-eth` even when the workload is Ethernet-side) | The library's `.pc` file installed by the DOCA host packages. A typo to `doca-rdma` silently links the wrong library; a fallback to `libibverbs` puts the user on the wrong side of the boundary in [CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy) |
| Required runtime libs | `libdoca_common` plus the verbs runtime referenced by `pkg-config --libs doca-verbs` | The raw-verbs library depends on Core (`doca-common`); it does NOT auto-pull `doca-rdma` / `doca-eth` / `doca-rmax`, and adding any of them on the link line as a *"just in case"* hides the drop-down decision the agent and user already made |
| Header check | The verbs headers resolvable under $(pkg-config --variable=includedir doca-common) (`doca_verbs.h` and the adjacent `doca_verbs_*.h` family) | If `pkg-config --cflags doca-verbs` resolves but the include is missing, the install is partial — route to [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug) |
| Minimum required DOCA version | Query with `pkg-config --modversion doca-verbs`; never hardcode in build files | Cross-version build/runtime mixing breaks per [CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility](CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility), and verbs-only upgrades are a documented partial-install pattern. The doca-verbs ABI is on the experimental tier and may shift between releases |
| Coexistence with the higher-level library on the same link line | Allowed only if BOTH libraries are independently used in the same binary; never *just in case* | Adding `doca-rdma` (or `doca-eth` / `doca-rmax`) to a binary that only uses `doca-verbs` is a code-smell that suggests the drop-down was not actually needed |

For non-C consumers (Rust, Go, Python), the link surface is the
same `*.so` files; the FFI wrapper layer is the language-specific
binding and is out of scope for this skill — but the five slots
above are still the load-bearing inputs the wrapper needs.

## modify

Goal: take a shipped DOCA Verbs sample as the verified starting
point and apply a minimum-diff modification to express the user's
intent — OR, for the libibverbs-porting case, walk the integration
path step by step (this is the load-bearing case for this skill in
particular).

The universal modify-a-shipped-sample workflow lives in
[`doca-programming-guide TASKS.md ## modify`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#modify).
Use it as-is for the *modify-a-sample* path. The verbs-specific
overlays are the *modify-from-sample schema fill* AND the
*libibverbs-porting block* below.

**Modify-from-sample schema fill — the five slots the agent must
elicit from the user before recommending any code-level edit:**

| Slot | What the agent asks the user | Verbs-specific consideration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Starting sample | Which sample under the installed DOCA samples tree? Run `ls /opt/mellanox/doca/samples/` and pick the one whose QP shape (reliable vs unreliable; connected vs unconnected; RDMA-side vs Ethernet-side) most closely matches the user's intent | Pick the closest in *QP shape* (RC / UC — the only QP types this release defines) and *completion-handling path* (DOCA PE vs manual CQ poll vs comp-channel event, per [CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability](CAPABILITIES.md#observability)). Do NOT bridge across both axes in a single modify pass — a smaller diff is always safer than a re-architecture |
| 2. Verbs / opcodes added or removed | Which WR opcodes? Which QP features (ECE, CC-group, CQE-inline, ordering-semantic, send-DBR-mode)? Which SRQ options? Which AH attributes? Which Ethernet-queue options (TS-source-type, plane-index, multi-pkt-send-WQE, flush-in-error)? | Each added opcode / WR flag / QP attribute / SRQ option / AH attribute / CC-group hint / Ethernet-queue option needs its own `doca_verbs_device_attr_get_*` query from `## configure` step 5 against the active `doca_devinfo` before any code-level change |
| 3. MR / PD changes | Which MR(s) / PD(s) change? | Refer to the no-mixing rule in [CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy) — if the user is tempted to reuse an `ibv_pd` / `ibv_mr` from existing code, the porting block below is the right path |
| 4. Completion-handling change | Switch PE → manual CQ poll → comp-channel, or vice versa? | This is a re-architecture, not a tweak. If yes, recommend the user start from the sample that already uses the target path instead of patching one over |
| 5. QP type / queue sizing | Change QP type (RC / UC) or queue depths? | Same option set as [`doca-rdma`](../doca-rdma/SKILL.md) when relevant; re-run `## configure` step 5 — QP-type support is device-conditional even at the verbs level (`doca_verbs_device_attr_get_is_qp_type_supported`) |

**Libibverbs porting block — what the agent walks the user through
when they arrive with existing `ibv_*` code.** This is NOT a
textual replacement; it is an integration into the DOCA Core
model:

1. **Confirm the case really wants `doca-verbs`, not the matching
   higher-level DOCA library.** Most libibverbs ports land cleaner
   on the higher-level surface because the task abstractions cover
   the case once the user names what they actually do. Re-walk
   the drop-down decision in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) before any
   porting work. A worked instance: a libibverbs codebase that
   sends `IBV_SEND_INLINE` from a custom QP attribute likely maps
   to `doca-rdma` with the matching `doca_rdma_task_send_*`
   abstraction and a per-task inline-data flag; only if that
   abstraction does NOT expose the inline path does the user need
   to drop to `doca-verbs` and set the verbs-side equivalent
   (`doca_verbs_qp_init_attr_set_max_inline_data` + a WR with the
   inline flag).
2. **Replace `ibv_context` ownership with `doca_dev` ownership.**
   The device handle the verbs context consumes is `doca_dev`,
   discovered through the standard DOCA Core path
   (`doca_dev_open` on a `doca_devinfo`), not through
   `ibv_open_device`. Mixing the two handles on the same hardware
   resource is the no-mixing rule in
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy).
3. **Build the verbs context.** Call
   `doca_verbs_context_create(dev, &ctx)`; create the PD with
   `doca_verbs_pd_create(ctx, &pd)`; create the CQ(s) via the
   `doca_verbs_cq_attr_*` + `doca_verbs_cq_create` family; create
   the QP via the `doca_verbs_qp_init_attr_*` +
   `doca_verbs_qp_create` family; drive the QP state machine to
   the in-use state with `doca_verbs_qp_modify` using a
   `doca_verbs_qp_attr` built via the
   `doca_verbs_qp_attr_*` setters; build the AH attributes via
   `doca_verbs_ah_attr_*` setters and attach to the QP via
   `doca_verbs_qp_attr_set_ah_attr` for RoCE or IB QPs.
4. **Integrate with the DOCA Core lifecycle.** Wrap the verbs
   object set in a `doca_ctx_*` lifecycle per
   [`doca-common TASKS.md ## configure`](../doca-common/TASKS.md#configure).
   Calls that lived in `ibv_*` setup move into the
   verbs-init-attr / qp-attr / ctx-start path; calls that lived
   in cleanup move into the destroy path (reverse order —
   destroy the QP before the CQ before the PD before the
   context).
5. **Drive completions through the DOCA progress engine.** Replace
   the libibverbs CQ-polling loop with `doca_pe_progress` against
   the verbs context, per
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability](CAPABILITIES.md#observability).
   If the user has a documented reason to keep manual CQ polling,
   the verbs-side equivalent is `doca_verbs_bridge_poll_cq`; if
   the user has a documented reason to use event-driven delivery,
   the verbs-side equivalent is `doca_verbs_comp_channel_create`
   + `doca_verbs_get_cq_event` + `doca_verbs_ack_cq_events`. The
   agent must make the choice explicit, not let it drift.
6. **Map every `ibv_*` error path onto `DOCA_ERROR_*`.** Per the
   raw-verbs error overlay in
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy),
   including the `IO_FAILED → inspect the CQE` rule.

The agent emits an *intent description + the five filled slots*
(modify-from-sample case) or *the six-step porting walk*
(libibverbs case); the *actual* unified diff against the sample
source is produced by the modify-from-sample renderer (deferred to
a future round). Until the renderer ships, the agent walks the
user through the diff line-by-line against the sample source they
read on disk, and has the user paste back the result for
validation.

## run

Goal: actually execute the built binary against the user's
installed DOCA on a host or BlueField, including a peer to connect
to (for QP-class workloads) or a traffic generator (for
Ethernet-queue-class workloads).

Steps the agent should walk the user through:

1. **Confirm the peer / traffic source is reachable.** For
   QP-class workloads, raw verbs needs a peer; the peer's RDMA
   stack and transport must match what this side asked for
   (IB / RoCE; QP type RC / UC and feature set per `## configure` step 5). A
   solo run produces a misleading hang. For Ethernet-queue-class
   workloads, the traffic generator (host-side `pktgen`, a remote
   sender, the DPU-side `doca-flow` rules feeding the queue) must
   be set up first.
2. **Run the listening side first.** Same shape as
   [`doca-rdma TASKS.md ## run`](../doca-rdma/TASKS.md#run) — the
   listening side must be in its accept-ready state before the
   connecting side starts. Raw verbs does not change that
   ordering.
3. **Capture the structured log.** Set `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL=trace` (or
   `--sdk-log-level DEBUG`) for the first run per the two-tier
   model in
   [`doca-common CAPABILITIES.md ## log`](../doca-common/CAPABILITIES.md#log).
   This is the cheapest way to make verbs-layer lifecycle
   transitions visible on first failure.
4. **Confirm completions are arriving on the chosen path.** A run
   that submits WRs but produces no CQEs is almost always one of:
   a missing `doca_pe_progress` call (DOCA PE path), a missing
   `doca_verbs_bridge_poll_cq` call (manual path), or a missing
   `epoll`/`doca_verbs_get_cq_event` chain (comp-channel path).
   Confirm the chosen path from
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability](CAPABILITIES.md#observability)
   is actually being driven on both sides.

## test

Goal: prove the configured raw-verbs context can actually move data
correctly between the two sides on the user's hardware, and that
the specific verb / opcode / WR flag / QP attribute that justified
the drop-down actually fires the way the user expected.

This is **a loop, not a one-shot pass.** Each iteration narrows
either the cap-query, the QP / WR setup, the completion-handling
path, or the user's no-mixing-with-libibverbs hygiene. The loop
terminates when either (a) the user's intended raw-verbs pattern
flows end-to-end with the expected completions, or (b) the agent
has narrowed the failure cause to a layer outside `doca-verbs`
itself (driver / firmware / network / *the higher-level library
was the right answer all along*) and escalated to the matching
skill.

Iteration shape — the smoke-before-scale principle is
non-negotiable for raw verbs:

1. **One QP, one WR, one completion.** The cheapest possible
   smoke. Bring up exactly ONE `doca_verbs_qp`, post exactly ONE
   WR (matched on the peer where two-sided), drain exactly ONE
   completion through the chosen path
   ([CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability](CAPABILITIES.md#observability)).
   If this fails, do not scale up — narrow.
2. **Re-confirm the cap-query passed for THIS device.** Re-run
   `doca_verbs_query_device` + the matching
   `doca_verbs_device_attr_get_*` for the specific verb / opcode
   / WR flag / QP attribute against the active `doca_devinfo`. If
   false → that's the answer; the user's device or DOCA version
   does not support the verb. Update the user's intent, climb
   back to the matching higher-level library, or update the
   install. Free the handle with `doca_verbs_device_attr_free`.
3. **Verify completion-handling path is wired.** If the agent
   picked the DOCA PE path: confirm `doca_pe_progress` is in the
   user's main loop on both sides. If the agent picked the
   manual CQ poll: confirm the `doca_verbs_bridge_poll_cq` loop
   runs and reads CQEs. If the agent picked the comp-channel
   path: confirm `doca_verbs_req_notify_cq` is called to arm the
   channel, the OS handle from `doca_verbs_comp_channel_get_handle`
   is `epoll`'d, and `doca_verbs_get_cq_event` /
   `doca_verbs_ack_cq_events` complete the cycle. The most common
   failure mode here is *picked one path in `## configure` but
   the user wrote a different path in the main loop*.
4. **Inspect the CQE on `DOCA_ERROR_IO_FAILED`.** Per the
   raw-verbs error overlay in
   [CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy),
   IO_FAILED means *the submit succeeded but the completion
   reports an error*. The answer is in the CQE error field; the
   agent must direct the user there before recommending any
   code-level change.
5. **Confirm the no-mixing-with-libibverbs hygiene.** If the user
   was porting libibverbs code, walk the porting block from
   [`## modify`](#modify) and confirm no leftover `ibv_*` call
   touches an object owned by `doca-verbs`. Mixed handles are the
   highest-cost-to-find raw-verbs bug.

Eval-loop overlay — why this is a loop, not a one-shot pass:

| Iteration trigger | What it looks like | What changes next iteration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DOCA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` on the verb / attribute / option we expected to work | A `doca_verbs_device_attr_get_*` returned true at configure time, but the runtime rejects the WR or the modify call | Re-run the same `doca_verbs_query_device` + matching `doca_verbs_device_attr_get_*` against the active selected `doca_devinfo`; verify that the queried attribute, selected device, and requested runtime configuration still match. If support is absent, climb back up or update the environment |
| `DOCA_ERROR_IO_FAILED` on the WR | Submit returned `DOCA_SUCCESS`; completion arrives with error status | Stop reading the submit return; read the CQE error field. The cross-cutting taxonomy ladder in [`doca-debug ## debug`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug) takes over from the CQE error |
| Submit succeeded but no completion at all | One of: the PE is not progressed, the `doca_verbs_bridge_poll_cq` loop is missing, the comp-channel is not armed (`doca_verbs_req_notify_cq` not called) or its handle is not `epoll`'d, or the peer disconnected silently | Map to the path picked in [CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability](CAPABILITIES.md#observability); only ONE of PE / manual / comp-channel should be active on this CQ |
| Intermittent `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE` on `doca_verbs_qp_modify` / WR submit | QP state transitions misordered | Re-walk the verbs object lifecycle from [CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes); raw verbs exposes the QP state machine directly via `doca_verbs_qp_modify` + `_set_current_state` / `_set_next_state`, and the agent must confirm each transition's precondition |
| Same code that worked yesterday now fails with `NOT_PERMITTED` | RDMA stack module loads / user group / ulimits regressed | Route to [`doca-setup TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug); this is an env regression, not a verbs code change |
| The user's case turned out to be covered by the higher-level library after all | The drop-down was unnecessary; the smoke surfaced a higher-level alternative | This is a successful outcome of the loop. Climb back up to [`doca-rdma`](../doca-rdma/SKILL.md) / [`doca-eth`](../doca-eth/SKILL.md) / [`doca-rmax`](../doca-rmax/SKILL.md) and retire the raw-verbs path |

Loop terms are exact: an iteration's **kind** is the `Iteration
trigger` row selected above; its **prescribed change** is that row's
`What changes next iteration` action; and its **evidence** is the
cap-query, QP state, submit result, and selected completion-path
capture taken before and after that change. The outcome is
**resolved** when the named smoke turns green, **shape-changed** when
the re-run selects a different trigger row or materially changes
that evidence, and **unchanged** when the prescribed change was
applied but the re-run selects the same trigger row with the same
outcome and materially unchanged evidence. The baseline occurrence
and that post-change re-run are the two consecutive iterations; on
`unchanged`, stop and escalate to
[`doca-debug ## debug`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug) with the
captured layer-1-through-5 evidence.

## debug

Goal: when a `doca_verbs_*` call returns a `DOCA_ERROR_*` (or the
program doesn't make forward progress), narrow the cause to a
specific layer and act on it.

The cross-library debug ladder lives in
[`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug).
Walk through it in order — install → version → build → link →
runtime → program → driver — *before* recommending
raw-verbs-specific fixes. This skill's overlay names the
raw-verbs-specific manifestation at layers 5 (runtime) and 6
(program):

**Layer 5 (runtime) — raw-verbs overlay.**

- Walk the QP state machine: was the QP transitioned through every
  state the verbs surface requires before the first WR was posted?
  Out-of-order transitions return `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE`, not a
  self-describing symptom. Query the current state via
  `doca_verbs_qp_query` to confirm where the QP actually is.
- Confirm exactly ONE completion-handling path is active on the
  CQ — the DOCA progress engine OR `doca_verbs_bridge_poll_cq` OR
  the `doca_verbs_comp_channel` chain, never two. Mixed paths
  drop completions silently.
- On `DOCA_ERROR_IO_FAILED`, the submit return is not the answer.
  Direct the user to the CQE error field per
  [CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy).
- Wire `doca_verbs_get_async_event_handle` +
  `doca_verbs_get_async_event` + `doca_verbs_ack_async_event` into
  the run loop if the symptom looks like a device-level event
  (QP fatal error, port state change) — those will not surface on
  the data-plane CQ.

**Layer 6 (program) — raw-verbs overlay.**

- **No mixing with libibverbs.** This is the single
  highest-frequency raw-verbs program bug. Search the user's code
  for any `ibv_*` call that touches an object owned by
  `doca-verbs`; route to the porting block in
  [`## modify`](#modify) when found.
- Lifecycle order: configure → start → use → stop → destroy.
  Out-of-order returns `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE`. The most common
  case in verbs context is destroying an MR or PD before the QP
  that referenced it, or destroying the `doca_verbs_context`
  before the per-object handles it owned.
- Cap-query mismatches: the program's selected device, queried
  attribute, or requested runtime configuration does not match
  the device-level capability snapshot. Re-run the query against
  the active `doca_devinfo` per
  [CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
  cap-query rule.
- **Climb-back-up check.** Before exhausting a layer-6 debug
  session, ask: *does the higher-level
  [`doca-rdma`](../doca-rdma/SKILL.md) /
  [`doca-eth`](../doca-eth/SKILL.md) /
  [`doca-rmax`](../doca-rmax/SKILL.md) cover this case? If yes,
  is the raw-verbs path still required?* Sometimes the cheapest
  fix at layer 6 is to drop the raw-verbs path entirely.
- Freed-handle hygiene: confirm `doca_verbs_device_attr_free` was
  called after every `doca_verbs_query_device`. A slow leak shows
  up as memory growth across reconfiguration cycles and is easy
  to miss in short smoke runs.

Once the layer is identified, route to the matching debug verb on
the matching skill: install / build / link / driver to
[`doca-setup ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug);
cross-cutting runtime to
[`doca-debug ## debug`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug);
program-layer Core-context patterns to
[`doca-programming-guide TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#debug);
higher-level RDMA-layer patterns the user might climb back to,
to [`doca-rdma TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-rdma/TASKS.md#debug);
higher-level Ethernet-queue patterns to
[`doca-eth TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-eth/TASKS.md#debug);
higher-level Rivermax patterns to
[`doca-rmax TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-rmax/TASKS.md#debug).

## use

Goal: walk the **verbs object-use sequence** — the exact sequence
of `doca_verbs_*` calls that follows a healthy
[`## configure`](#configure) on the live raw-verbs context.

This verb is the *use-the-verbs-context* counterpart to
[`## configure`](#configure): it names the sequence so the agent
can quote it the same way every time, whether the user is on the
RDMA-side, the Ethernet-queue side, or porting from libibverbs.

The use sequence, in order, on top of the doca-common foundation
walked in [`doca-common TASKS.md ## use`](../doca-common/TASKS.md#use):

1. **`doca_verbs_context_create(dev, &ctx)`** — wrap the
   `doca_dev` opened in [`doca-common TASKS.md ## use`](../doca-common/TASKS.md#use)
   step 4 in a verbs context. The `ctx` handle is the root of
   the per-library object set.
2. **`doca_verbs_pd_create(ctx, &pd)`** — create the protection
   domain. Every QP / MR / AH attached to this verbs context
   lives inside this PD.
3. **(Optional) Create the completion channel.** If the user
   picked the comp-channel completion path (per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](CAPABILITIES.md#observability)),
   call `doca_verbs_comp_channel_create(ctx, &chan)`. The channel
   must exist before the CQ that will use it.
4. **Create the CQ(s).** Build a `doca_verbs_cq_attr` via the
   `doca_verbs_cq_attr_create` + `_set_*` family (size, overrun,
   collapsed, entry size). For the comp-channel path, attach the
   already-created channel with
   `doca_verbs_cq_attr_set_comp_channel` BEFORE
   `doca_verbs_cq_create(ctx, cq_attr,
   &cq)`. One CQ per send / receive direction is the common case;
   shared send-and-receive CQs are valid when the user has named
   that as the shape.
5. **(Optional) Create the SRQ(s).** Build a
   `doca_verbs_srq_init_attr` via the `doca_verbs_srq_init_attr_create`
   + `_set_*` family, then `doca_verbs_srq_create(ctx, init_attr,
   &srq)`. Use when multiple QPs share a receive queue.
6. **(Optional) Create the CC group.** If the user is attaching
   a congestion-control group, build a
   `doca_verbs_cc_group_attr` via `doca_verbs_cc_group_attr_create`
   + `_set_hint`, then `doca_verbs_cc_group_create(ctx, group_attr,
   &cc_group)`. Attach to the QP via
   `doca_verbs_qp_attr_set_cc_group` during the QP modify.
7. **Build the QP.** `doca_verbs_qp_init_attr_create(&init_attr)`
   → call the `doca_verbs_qp_init_attr_set_*` setters to wire
   `set_pd(pd)`, `set_send_cq(send_cq)`, `set_receive_cq(receive_cq)`,
   `set_sq_wr(...)`, `set_rq_wr(...)`, `set_send_max_sges(...)`,
   `set_receive_max_sges(...)`, `set_max_inline_data(...)`,
   `set_qp_type(...)`, plus any feature-specific setter the
   cap-query allowed (`set_send_dbr_mode`, `set_ordering_semantic`,
   `set_cqe_inline`, `set_dpa`, …) → `doca_verbs_qp_create(ctx,
   init_attr, &qp)`. Destroy the `init_attr` after with
   `doca_verbs_qp_init_attr_destroy` (it holds only the init-time
   spec; the QP object owns its own state).
8. **Drive the QP state machine.** Build a `doca_verbs_qp_attr`
   via `doca_verbs_qp_attr_create` + `_set_current_state` /
   `_set_next_state` plus the per-state required setters (path
   MTU / PKey index / port num / SQ-PSN / RQ-PSN / dest QP num /
   AH attributes / atomic mode / retry / RNR / timeout for an RC
   QP; the subset varies by QP type). Apply each transition via
   `doca_verbs_qp_modify(qp, qp_attr)` until the QP is in the
   in-use state (RTS for RC). Destroy the `qp_attr` after with
   `doca_verbs_qp_attr_destroy`.
9. **Connect the PE.** `doca_pe_connect_ctx(pe, ctx_as_doca_ctx)`
   so completions on this context surface through
   `doca_pe_progress`. This step must happen BEFORE
   `doca_ctx_start`; the verbs context's `doca_ctx *` is
   accessible through the standard DOCA Core bridge accessors.
10. **`doca_ctx_start(ctx_as_doca_ctx)`** — transition the verbs
    context to RUNNING. From this point WR submission is allowed.
11. **Post WRs.** The submit family is the `doca_verbs_bridge_*`
    surface: `doca_verbs_bridge_post_send(qp, wr, ...)` for send
    WRs, `doca_verbs_bridge_post_recv(qp, wr, ...)` for receive
    WRs, `doca_verbs_bridge_post_srq_recv(srq, wr, ...)` for SRQ
    receives. The submit return is `DOCA_SUCCESS` /
    `DOCA_ERROR_*`; on success the WR is in flight and completion
    is reported on the chosen completion path.
12. **Drain completions.** PE path: `doca_pe_progress(pe)` in the
    main loop. Manual path: `doca_verbs_bridge_poll_cq(cq, ...)`
    in the main loop. Comp-channel path: `doca_verbs_req_notify_cq`
    to arm → `epoll`/`poll` on the
    `doca_verbs_comp_channel_get_handle` fd → on event,
    `doca_verbs_get_cq_event(chan, ...)` to drain →
    `doca_verbs_ack_cq_events(cq, n)` to ACK → re-arm with
    `doca_verbs_req_notify_cq`.
13. **(Optional) Wire async events.** `doca_verbs_get_async_event_handle(ctx)`
    returns an OS handle; `epoll` it and call
    `doca_verbs_get_async_event` / `doca_verbs_ack_async_event` on
    fire to surface device-level events (QP fatal, port state
    change) that do not appear on the data-plane CQ.
14. **Shutdown.** Drain inflight WRs (loop the chosen completion
    path until quiet); transition the QP through the destroy-
    appropriate state (typically ERR via
    `doca_verbs_qp_modify(qp, qp_attr_to_err)`); `doca_ctx_stop`;
    destroy in reverse order — QP → SRQ → CQ → CC group → comp
    channel → PD → `doca_verbs_context_destroy(ctx)`. Per
    [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy`](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy),
    destroying a parent (PD, context) before its children (QP,
    CQ) is `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE`.

The agent's rule: **the order of the selected objects is the
contract.** Optional steps 3, 5, and 6 impose ordering only when
their objects are used: a completion channel precedes its CQ, and
an SRQ or CC group precedes the QP configuration that references
it. Violating a selected object's API preconditions can return
`DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE`; misordering step 14 destroy-targets can do
the same. The cost of getting the order right once is much lower
than the cost of debugging a misordered destroy in production.

## Deferred task verbs

The following verbs are out of scope for this skill but are
commonly asked in the same conversations. Route them as follows so
the agent does not invent guidance:

- **install.** Installing DOCA, choosing packages, post-install
  verification, `pkg-config` wiring — defer to
  [`doca-setup`](../../doca-setup/SKILL.md) and to the
  install-tree layout in
  [doca-public-knowledge-map ## Layout of an installed DOCA package](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#layout-of-an-installed-doca-package).
  The [`## install`](#install) anchor in this file holds only the
  per-skill readiness checks; the deep install chain itself lives
  in `doca-setup`.
- **deploy.** Deploying raw-verbs-using applications at scale,
  Kubernetes operator workflows, multi-tenant RDMA isolation —
  out of scope for Phase 1 and reserved for a future platform
  skill. For single-host first-run testing, the right verb in
  this skill is [`## run`](#run).
- **rollback.** Coordinated rollback across multiple hosts /
  DPUs — out of scope. For a single in-session raw-verbs
  configuration rollback, the right verb in this skill is
  destroying the verbs context (`doca_verbs_context_destroy`
  after every per-object `_destroy`) and re-running
  [`## configure`](#configure) with corrected parameters.
- **kernel-level driver install / firmware burn.** Out of scope
  for this skill. Route to
  [`doca-hardware-safety`](../../doca-hardware-safety/SKILL.md)
  for the meta-policy and to
  [`doca-setup TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug)
  driver layer for the env-side recovery story.
- **Climb back to the matching higher-level library for a use
  case it actually covers.** Not a verb in this skill at all —
  that conversation belongs in
  [`doca-rdma TASKS.md ## configure`](../doca-rdma/TASKS.md#configure)
  (or [`doca-eth`](../doca-eth/SKILL.md) /
  [`doca-rmax`](../doca-rmax/SKILL.md)). This skill's job is to
  *recognize* when the climb-back is the right answer, then hand
  the conversation off.

## Command appendix

Every command below is **cross-cutting on DOCA Verbs** — it answers
a recurring class of question that comes up in the verbs above. The
agent should treat the *class* as load-bearing; the worked example
is a single instance. Run-as user is the unprivileged user unless
noted. Rows that need elevated privileges call that out explicitly.

**Infra-aware preamble (every row below).** Per the bundle's
detect → prefer → fall back → report contract documented in
[`doca-structured-tools-contract ## The agent behavior contract`](../../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md#the-agent-behavior-contract),
the agent should:

1. Probe for the matching structured helper FIRST (`doca-env
   --json` for version + devices + libraries + drivers in one
   shot; `doca-capability-snapshot` for per-device capability
   flags; `version-matrix.json` for *"available since"* lookups).
2. If the probe succeeds, the structured tool's output is the
   authoritative answer and the agent SHOULD NOT also run the
   manual command in the row below. Report *"using structured
   `<tool>`"*.
3. If the probe fails, fall back to the manual command in the row.
   Report *"falling back to manual chain"*.
4. The schemas the structured tools emit are defined in
   [`doca-structured-tools-contract ## Schemas`](../../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md#schemas);
   the version-handling semantics (four-way match, NGC,
   headers-win) are owned by
   [`doca-version`](../../doca-version/SKILL.md).

| Command (worked example) | Owning step | Class of question it answers | What healthy output looks like |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pkg-config --modversion doca-verbs` | [`## configure`](#configure) step 3; [`## build`](#build) | What is the build-time raw-verbs version? | A semver string matching `pkg-config --modversion doca-common` AND `doca_caps --version`. Disagreement = verbs-only partial install (route to [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug) layer 2) |
| `pkg-config --cflags --libs doca-verbs` | [`## build`](#build) | What include + link flags does the linker need? | Includes resolve under $(pkg-config --variable=includedir doca-common); libs include the verbs runtime plus `-ldoca_common`; should NOT auto-pull `-ldoca-rdma` or `-ldoca-eth` |
| `ls /opt/mellanox/doca/samples/` | [`## modify`](#modify) slot 1 | Which DOCA samples ship in this install — and which one is the closest starting point for the user's QP shape / completion-handling choice? | A list of sample subdirectories; the user picks the closest in QP shape + completion path |
| `ls $(pkg-config --variable=includedir doca-common)  \| grep doca_verbs` | [`## configure`](#configure) step 2 | Which `doca_verbs_*.h` headers are installed (the headers-win-over-docs anchor)? | A list including `doca_verbs.h` and any adjacent `doca_verbs_*.h` files the release ships |
| `doca_caps --list-devs` | [`## configure`](#configure) step 4 | Which devices on this host can be used as a `doca_dev`? | One row per visible device with PCIe address and capability flags; raw verbs needs at least one row, same as the higher-level RDMA / Eth / Rmax libraries |
| `doca_caps --version` | [`## configure`](#configure) step 3; [`## test`](#test) step 2 | What is the *runtime* DOCA version on this host? | A semver string matching `pkg-config --modversion doca-verbs` |
| `cat /opt/mellanox/doca/applications/VERSION` | [`## configure`](#configure) step 3; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 1 | What does the install tree itself claim its version is? | A semver string matching the other two version sources |
| `dmesg \| tail -n 40` (sudo) | [`## debug`](#debug) layer 7 | What did the kernel / driver log around the last raw-verbs call? | Empty or recent benign messages. Repeated mlx5 / IB errors → driver-layer bug; route to [`doca-setup ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug) |
| `ibv_devinfo` (sudo) | [`## configure`](#configure) step 5; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 7 | What does the underlying `libibverbs` see for this device? | One device row with `state: PORT_ACTIVE` and a sane MTU. **NOTE:** running `ibv_devinfo` is a diagnostic; it does NOT license the program to also call `ibv_*` against a `doca-verbs`-owned object (per the no-mixing rule in [CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy)) |
| `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL=trace ./<binary>` | [`## run`](#run) step 3 | What did the structured DOCA logger emit for the first failing call? | A trace-level line on every lifecycle transition and every WR submission. Silence after submit = chosen completion-handling path not driven |
| `<binary> --sdk-log-level DEBUG 2> doca.log` | [`## run`](#run) step 3 | Same as above via SDK-tier setter | A flood of DOCA library internal trace; the user's own DEBUG lines remain controlled by the app tier per the two-tier model in [`doca-common CAPABILITIES.md ## log`](../doca-common/CAPABILITIES.md#log) |

For commands shared across libraries (`pkg-config --modversion`,
`doca_caps`, `cat /opt/mellanox/doca/applications/VERSION`,
`DOCA_LOG_LEVEL` / `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL_SDK`) the cross-library overlay
is in
[`doca-debug TASKS.md ## Command appendix`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#command-appendix);
this table adds the raw-verbs-specific rows on top.

Three cross-cutting rules for this appendix:

- **Never invent verbs symbols or flags.** The verbs ABI is large,
  version-gated, and shipped under the experimental tier on this
  release; `ls
  $(pkg-config --variable=includedir doca-common)  | grep doca_verbs`
  on the user's install is the only safe source.
- **Never paraphrase a verbs `DOCA_ERROR_*`.** Quote
  `doca_error_get_descr()` verbatim — the layer-classifier in
  [`doca-debug ## debug`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug) layer 5
  needs the exact text.
- **Cross-link instead of duplicate.** Cross-cutting commands (the
  read-only triple, `dmesg`, `mlxconfig -d <pcie> q`) live in
  [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## Command appendix`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#command-appendix);
  this appendix names only the raw-verbs-specific ones.
