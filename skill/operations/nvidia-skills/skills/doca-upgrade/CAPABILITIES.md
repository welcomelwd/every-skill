# DOCA upgrade — capabilities, version compatibility, errors, observability, safety

**Where to start:** Pick the H2 anchor that matches your question
(what an upgrade covers / how the target release is chosen / which
failure modes to recognize / how to prove the upgrade happened /
the upgrade-specific safety overlay) and read that section
end-to-end. The tables in each section are the load-bearing content;
the prose is interpretation.

Read this file when the loader sent you here from
[SKILL.md](SKILL.md). For the *how* of executing each workflow, jump
to [TASKS.md](TASKS.md). The version-detection chain this skill
consumes is owned by
[`doca-version`](../doca-version/SKILL.md); the hardware / firmware /
reboot discipline this skill delegates to is owned by
[`doca-hardware-safety`](../doca-hardware-safety/SKILL.md).

## Pattern overview

Every planned-upgrade question resolves into **detect what is
installed → report the gap to the target → ASK for explicit
confirmation → only then walk a guided upgrade.** A failed/partial
upgrade instead resolves into **capture the current state → classify
the failure → apply one documented corrective action → re-verify or
rollback/escalate**. The patterns are CLASSES — they apply across
every DOCA release, every upgrade mode, and every host kind.

| Upgrade pattern | Class shape | Where the substance lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Detect + discover the gap | Read the installed version (via `doca-version`) and the available target release (via the public release notes) and state the delta | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) + [TASKS.md ## configure](TASKS.md#configure) |
| 2. Report + confirm | Present installed, target, and cost; STOP; obtain explicit user confirmation before any command runs | [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy) confirmation gate + [TASKS.md ## run](TASKS.md#run) |
| 3. Walk the guided upgrade | Execute the mode-appropriate steps; delegate every hardware / firmware / reboot step to `doca-hardware-safety` | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) mode table + [TASKS.md ## run](TASKS.md#run) |
| 4. Verify the upgrade landed | Re-run the four-way match (via `doca-version`) and prove the new version is what is loaded | [`## Observability`](#observability) + [TASKS.md ## test](TASKS.md#test) |
| 5. Diagnose a failed / partial upgrade | Map the symptom (partial upgrade, source drift, host/BFB skew, aborted transaction) to a recovery action | [`## Error taxonomy`](#error-taxonomy) + [TASKS.md ## debug](TASKS.md#debug) |

Two cross-cutting rules that apply to *every* pattern above:

- **Never upgrade automatically.** The agent detects and reports;
  the user decides. No upgrade command runs until the user has seen
  the gap report and explicitly confirmed (see
  [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy)).
- **Surface sunset / deprecation status before recommending more
  investment.** When the gap report touches a component that may be
  on a deprecation track, route the user to the public release notes
  to confirm lifecycle status rather than recommending continued
  investment.

## Capabilities and modes

An "upgrade" is not one operation. The agent identifies which
**upgrade mode** the user is in before reporting the gap, because
the mode determines the steps, the rollback shape, and which
hardware-touching steps (if any) are delegated to
[`doca-hardware-safety`](../doca-hardware-safety/SKILL.md).

| Upgrade mode | What moves | What it touches | Who owns the touching step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Host apt upgrade** | The host-side DOCA packages (`doca-common`, the per-tool packages, `doca-host`) move to a newer release | Userspace packages; may pull a new kernel module / DKMS / OFED step | The apt-source path is owned by [`doca-setup ## configure`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure); the precheck is [`doca-version ## apt-source consistency`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#apt-source-consistency) |
| **BFB reflash** | The BlueField OS image and DPU-side DOCA install move to a newer BFB | The BlueField OS image, the DPU PCIe surface, every hosted service container; a link-breaking, reboot-class change | Delegated entirely to [`doca-hardware-safety ## modify`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#modify); never redefined here |
| **Container image tag bump** | An NGC DOCA container deployment moves from one tag to a newer one | The container image only; the host packages and BFB are independent anchors | The tag-selection rule is owned by [`doca-setup`](../doca-setup/SKILL.md); the version inside the new tag is verified via [`doca-version ## test`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#test) |
| **Downgrade / rollback** | The host packages, BFB, or container tag move *back* to a prior release (e.g. for a bug repro or a regression rollback) | The same surfaces as the forward modes, in reverse | Same delegation as the forward mode; the rollback discipline overlays [`doca-hardware-safety ## debug`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#debug) |

The agent's rule: **identify the mode, then report the gap for that
mode.** A host apt upgrade and a BFB reflash are different changes
with different blast radii even when they move the same release
number; the agent does not conflate them.

### Sunset / deprecation awareness

When the agent detects what is installed, part of the gap report is
checking whether an installed component is on a deprecation / sunset
track. The team has flagged DOCA App Shield and the DOCA Flow
Inspector service — both now policy-excluded from this public
bundle (see [AGENTS.md `## Non-goals`](../../AGENTS.md#non-goals-questions-the-agent-should-recognize-and-refuse-politely)
item 7) — as worked examples to watch on this front. The discipline is:

- Treat a possible sunset as a finding to **surface**, not a fact to
  assert from memory. The authoritative statement of a component's
  lifecycle status is the public release notes, reached via
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## Public documentation entry points`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#public-documentation-entry-points)
  (DOCA Release Notes) — the agent routes the user there to confirm.
- When a component does appear to be sunsetting, the agent does NOT
  recommend continued investment in it as part of an upgrade. It
  surfaces the sunset status, points at the public migration / docs
  path via
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md),
  and lets the user decide whether to upgrade-in-place or migrate.
- This is class-shaped: DOCA App Shield and the Flow Inspector
  service are the worked examples, but the discipline applies to any
  component whose release notes mark it deprecated.

## Version compatibility

For the canonical DOCA version-detection chain, the four-way match
rule, NGC container semantics, and the headers-win-over-docs rule,
see [`doca-version`](../doca-version/SKILL.md). The body lives there;
this skill does not duplicate it.

**The upgrade overlay** is:

- **The gap is `installed → target`.** The installed version comes
  from the four-source chain in
  [`doca-version ## Capabilities and modes`](../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes);
  the target release is the one the user wants, confirmed against the
  public release notes — never a version string from agent memory.
- **The target must be a supported pairing.** Before recommending a
  move, the agent confirms the `installed → target` jump is inside
  the window NVIDIA documents in the
  [DOCA Compatibility Policy](https://docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/doca-compatibility-policy/index.html)
  (cited once via
  [`doca-version ## Version compatibility`](../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility)).
  If the target is outside that documented window, or the policy and
  target release notes do not document the exact requested jump,
  report it as unsupported and STOP; do not recommend or execute the
  move or synthesize an intermediate-release ladder. Route the user
  through `doca-public-knowledge-map` to the release-matched policy
  and ask for a documented supported path, or keep the current
  release in place.
- **Host, BFB, firmware, and container tag are independent anchors.**
  An upgrade that moves one anchor must bring the others into a
  supported pairing; a move that leaves them skewed is a failed
  upgrade, caught by the post-upgrade four-way match in
  [`## Observability`](#observability).
- **Never quote a version literal from memory.** The version-handling
  anti-hallucination rules in
  [`doca-version ## Safety policy`](../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy)
  apply here without modification.

## Error taxonomy

The upgrade-level failure modes the agent should recognize and
disambiguate before continuing. For the cross-library `DOCA_ERROR_*`
taxonomy itself, see
[`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy);
the rows below are the *upgrade-level* causes that bubble up as
those errors.

| Symptom | Most-likely upgrade cause | First action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Some DOCA packages moved to the target release; others did not | **Partial upgrade** — the package set converged unevenly (a held package, a missing per-tool package, or an interrupted run) | Re-detect the four sources per [`doca-version ## debug`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug); converge the package set on one release before any other diagnosis |
| `apt-cache policy doca-common` shows a Candidate from a different release than what is installed | **Apt-source drift** — the configured source channel disagrees with the installed release | Reconcile the apt source first per [`doca-version ## apt-source consistency`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#apt-source-consistency); do not upgrade until the source matches the intended target |
| After the upgrade, `pkg-config`/`doca_caps` report the new release but `bfver` still reports the old BFB | **Host/BFB version skew post-upgrade** — the host moved but the BFB did not | The BFB reflash is the missing step; route it to [`doca-hardware-safety ## modify`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#modify), and re-verify per [`doca-version ## test`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#test) |
| `dpkg` reports an interrupted / half-configured transaction; further `apt` invocations refuse to proceed | **Aborted transaction / `dpkg` interrupted** — the upgrade run was interrupted mid-flight | Recover the package database per the documented `dpkg`/`apt` repair path before retrying; see [TASKS.md ## debug](TASKS.md#debug) for the recovery ladder |
| Upgrade completed but the program now returns `DOCA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` / builds against a symbol the runtime lacks | **Build/runtime skew after upgrade** — the runtime `*.so` and the headers/`pkg-config` are now from different releases | Same partial-install diagnosis owned by [`doca-version ## debug`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug); reconverge, do not patch around in code |
| Downgrade left the host on the older release but a co-tenant workload now fails | **Rollback blast radius** — the downgrade affected shared host state | Treat the rollback with the same discipline as the forward move; route any hardware-touching rollback step to [`doca-hardware-safety ## debug`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#debug) |

## Observability

The upgrade observability surface is the set of commands that prove
whether the upgrade *did or did not* happen. There is no DOCA
"upgrade counter"; the visibility comes from comparing the version
state before and after against the sources
[`doca-version`](../doca-version/SKILL.md) owns. The agent reads the
same chain before the upgrade (to establish the baseline) and after
(to prove the move).

| Phase | Signal | What it tells the agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-upgrade | The four-source detection chain + four-way match status, captured per [`doca-version ## configure`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#configure) | The baseline the post-upgrade state is compared against; without it the agent cannot prove the move happened |
| Pre-upgrade | `apt-cache policy <pkg>` / the configured apt source channel | Whether the host *will* resolve to the intended target before any command runs; the apt-source precheck owns this |
| Post-upgrade | The same four-source chain re-read, plus the four-way match per [`doca-version ## test`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#test) | Whether the install converged on the target release and is internally consistent; a partial result is a failed upgrade |
| Post-upgrade | The BFB version (`bfver`) on BlueField hosts | Whether the BFB moved in step with the host packages, or is now skewed |
| Post-upgrade | The structured one-shot `doca-env --json` `version.consistent` field when present, per [`doca-structured-tools-contract ## Schemas`](../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md#schemas) | The four-way match pre-computed in one read; prefer it when the host has the helper |

The agent prefers the structured one-shot when present and falls
back to the manual chain `doca-version` documents otherwise. The
load-bearing rule: **prove the upgrade with the same sources before
and after; a claim that the upgrade "worked" without a post-upgrade
four-way match is not evidence.**

## Safety policy

This skill's safety surface is the **confirmation gate** on top of
the hardware-safety meta-policy. For the cross-cutting discipline
that wraps any hardware / firmware / reboot step — pre-flight
inventory, out-of-band access, maintenance window, replica-first
validation, rollback discipline, refuse-and-escalate — see
[`doca-hardware-safety ## Safety policy`](../doca-hardware-safety/CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy).
The body lives there; this skill does not redefine it.

**The upgrade-specific overlay** is:

- **Confirmation gate (never auto-upgrade).** The agent reports the
  `installed → target` gap and STOPS. No upgrade command runs until
  the user has seen the report and explicitly confirmed. *"Should I
  upgrade?"* is answered with the gap and a request to confirm, never
  with an upgrade command issued on the user's behalf.
- **Rollback-first.** Before the guided upgrade begins, the agent
  confirms a rollback path exists for the chosen mode (reinstall the
  prior release, reflash the prior BFB, redeploy the prior container
  tag) and that the prior version anchors are captured — the same
  documented-and-rehearsed rollback rule the hardware-safety
  meta-policy requires for any hardware-touching step.
  Viability means the prior artifact is identified by an immutable
  version/tag and is available through the release-matched documented
  source: the package manager can resolve the prior host package set,
  the prior BFB plus its published checksum is locally available or
  retrievable and has an OOB restore path, or the prior container tag
  resolves and the prior config is saved. Record the exact rollback
  artifact and verification command. If any required artifact,
  checksum, config snapshot, or recovery path is unavailable, STOP;
  a conceptual rollback is not a rollback path.
- **Maintenance window when disruptive.** An explicit, time-boxed
  maintenance window with stakeholders notified is mandatory when
  the target carries real workload, when the move disrupts a shared
  service, and for every BFB reflash or reboot-class step. A
  non-disruptive move on an idle, dedicated non-production target
  does not require a fictional stakeholder window; record that the
  target is isolated and why no window is needed.
