| 3 | HIGH | New Skill | Add `run-skill-generator` to official bundled skills table — teaches `/run` and `/verify` how to build/launch the project, records a per-project recipe at `.claude/skills/run-<name>/` (requires v2.1.145) | ✅ COMPLETE (added as row 9, count updated 6→9) |

| # | Priority | Type | Action | Status |
|---|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | HIGH | Renamed Skill | Rename `simplify` (row 1) to `code-review`; update description — `/simplify` was renamed to `/code-review` in v2.1.147, now reviews the current diff for correctness bugs at a chosen effort level (`--comment` posts findings as inline PR comments) | ✅ COMPLETE (renamed row 1 to `code-review` and rewrote description; bundled skill count stays 9) |
| 2 | LOW | Skill Naming | Agent flagged `fewer-permission-prompts` (report row 6) vs changelog name `less-permission-prompts` (v2.1.111) — verify which is canonical | ❌ INVALID (live `/` skill menu in this session confirms `fewer-permission-prompts` is the shipping name; report row 6 is correct, no change) |

Introduced v2.1.152, reaffirmed v2.1.157. Update count 15→16 | ✅ COMPLETE (added `disallowed-tools` row after `allowed-tools`, count updated 15→16) |
| 2 | HIGH | New Skill | Add `simplify` to official bundled skills table — cleanup-only review (reuse, simplification, efficiency, abstraction level), four review agents in parallel; from v2.1.154 it does NOT hunt for correctness bugs (use `/code-review` for that). Update count 9→10 | ✅ COMPLETE (added as row 10, count updated 9→10) |

Count updated 16→17 | ✅ COMPLETE (added `background` after `agent` in frontmatter table, count updated 16→17) |
| 2 | MED | New Skill | Investigate `deep-research` as a potential bundled skill — changelog v2.1.216 changed its invocation to manual-only, but official docs also use it as a user-authored skill example, making bundled status ambiguous | ✋ ON HOLD (naming ambiguity: docs use `deep-research` as both a bundled invocation example and a user-authored skill example; needs human review to confirm bundled status before adding) |
| 3 | LOW | New Skill | Investigate `ultrareview` as a potential bundled skill — changelog v2.1.218 mentions fixing `/ultrareview` with descriptive arguments, suggesting it may be a bundled max-effort code-review variant | ✋ ON HOLD (low confidence: changelog mention is insufficient to confirm bundled status; needs human review) |

| 1 | MED | Potential Removed Skills | `review` (row 14) and `security-review` (row 15) classification confirmed by today's research: official docs explicitly distinguish bundled skills (13 total) from "built-in commands reachable via the Skill tool" (`/init`, `/review`, `/security-review`) — report's bundled count of 15 overstates by 2; `/init` is also Skill-tool-invocable per docs but absent from report | ✋ ON HOLD (recurring from 2026-07-30; now confirmed as classification drift, not a docs omission; awaiting human review before reclassifying rows or moving them to a separate Skill-tool-invocable built-ins section) |
