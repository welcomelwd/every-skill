## Frontmatter Fields (20)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | No | Display name and `/slash-command` identifier. Defaults to the directory name if omitted |
| `description` | string | Recommended | What the command does. Shown in autocomplete and used by Claude for auto-discovery |
| `when_to_use` | string | No | Additional context for when Claude should invoke the skill — trigger phrases or example requests. Appended to `description` in the listing and counts toward the 1,536-character cap |
| `argument-hint` | string | No | Hint shown during autocomplete (e.g., `[issue-number]`, `[filename]`) |
| `arguments` | string/list | No | Named positional arguments for `$name` substitution in command content. Accepts a space-separated string or YAML list — names map to argument positions in order |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | No | Set `true` to prevent Claude from automatically invoking this command |
| `user-invocable` | boolean | No | Set `false` to hide from the `/` menu — command becomes background knowledge only |
| `paths` | string/list | No | Glob patterns that limit when this skill is activated. Accepts a comma-separated string or a YAML list. When set, Claude loads the skill automatically only when working with files matching the patterns |
| `allowed-tools` | string | No | Tools allowed without permission prompts when this command is active |
| `disallowed-tools` | string/list | No | Tools removed from Claude's available pool while this command is active. Clears when you send your next message. The inverse of `allowed-tools` |
| `model` | string | No | Model to use when this command runs (e.g., `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`) |
| `effort` | string | No | Override the model effort level when invoked (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`) |
| `context` | string | No | Set to `fork` to run the command in an isolated subagent context |
| `agent` | string | No | Subagent type when `context: fork` is set (default: `general-purpose`) |
| `background` | boolean | No | Only applies with `context: fork`. Set to `false` to wait for the forked subagent's result in the turn that invoked the skill, instead of running it in the background. Default: `true`. Requires v2.1.218+ |
| `shell` | string | No | Shell for `` !`command` `` blocks — accepts `bash` (default) or `powershell`. Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1` |
| `metadata` | object | No | Free-form YAML map for your own key-value data. Claude Code ignores the content (which must be a map); useful for catalog or entitlement fields read by your own tooling. Do not reuse reserved field names such as `paths` as keys |
| `license` | string | No | License covering the skill per the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) spec. Claude Code accepts the field but does not act on it |
| `compatibility` | string | No | Environment requirements for the skill per the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) spec, such as intended products or system prerequisites. Accepts up to 500 characters. Claude Code accepts the field but does not act on it |
| `hooks` | object | No | Lifecycle hooks scoped to this command |

Pass a number `N` to copy the Nth-latest response: `/copy 2` copies the second-to-last. When code blocks are present, shows an interactive picker to select individual blocks or the full response. Press `w` in the picker to write the selection to a file instead of the clipboard, which is useful over SSH |
| 39 | `/export [filename]` | ![Export](https://img.shields.io/badge/Export-7F8C8D?style=flat) | Export the current conversation as plain text. With a filename, writes directly to that file. Without, opens a dialog to copy to clipboard or save to a file |

| 46 | `/reload-plugins [--force]` | ![Extensions](https://img.shields.io/badge/Extensions-16A085?style=flat) | Reload all active plugins to apply pending changes without restarting.

| 51 | `/effort [low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max\|ultracode]` | ![Model](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model-E67E22?style=flat) | Set the model effort level. Available levels depend on the model and include `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` (session-only), and `ultracode` (combines `xhigh` reasoning with automatic workflow orchestration; session-only).

| 62 | `/ultrareview [PR or branch]` | ![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-27AE60?style=flat) | Run a deep, multi-agent code review in a cloud sandbox.
