Context is the foundation of how GitHub Copilot generates relevant, accurate suggestions. Understanding what Copilot "sees" and how it uses that information helps you write better prompts, get higher-quality completions, and work more effectively with AI assistance. This article explains the types of context Copilot uses and how to optimize your development environment for better results.

## What Copilot Sees

When GitHub Copilot generates a suggestion or responds to a chat message, it analyzes multiple sources of information from your development environment:

**Open Files**: Copilot can access content from files currently open in your editor. Having relevant files visible gives Copilot important context about your codebase structure, naming conventions, and coding patterns.

**Current Cursor Position**: The exact location of your cursor matters. Copilot considers the surrounding code—what comes before and after—to understand your current intent and generate contextually appropriate suggestions.

**Related Files**: Through imports, references, and dependencies, Copilot identifies files related to your current work. For example, if you're editing a component that imports a utility function, Copilot may reference that utility file to understand available functionality.

**Chat Conversation History**: In GitHub Copilot Chat, previous messages in your conversation provide context for follow-up questions. This allows for natural, iterative problem-solving where each response builds on earlier exchanges.

**Workspace Structure**: The organization of your project—directory structure, configuration files, and patterns—helps Copilot understand the type of project you're working on and follow appropriate conventions.

## Types of Context

GitHub Copilot leverages four distinct types of context to inform its suggestions:

### Editor Context

Editor context includes the active files displayed in your editor and the specific code visible on screen. When you have multiple files open in tabs or split views, Copilot can reference all of them to provide more informed suggestions.

**Example**: If you're writing a function that calls methods from a class defined in another open file, Copilot can suggest the correct method names and parameter types by referencing that class definition.

### Semantic Context

Semantic context goes beyond raw text to understand the meaning and relationships in your code. This includes function signatures, type definitions, interface contracts, class hierarchies, and inline comments that explain complex logic.

**Example**: When you're implementing an interface, Copilot uses the interface definition as semantic context to suggest correct method signatures with appropriate parameter types and return values.

### Conversation Context

In GitHub Copilot Chat, conversation context includes all previous messages, questions, and responses in the current chat session. This enables contextual follow-ups where you can ask "What about error handling?" and Copilot understands you're referring to the code discussed earlier.

**Example**: After asking Copilot to generate a database query function, you can follow up with "Add error handling and logging" without repeating the full context—Copilot remembers the previous exchange.

### Workspace Context

Workspace context includes project-level information like your directory structure, configuration files (`.gitignore`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`), and overall repository organization. This helps Copilot understand your project type, dependencies, and conventions.

**Example**: If your workspace contains a `package.json` with TypeScript and React dependencies, Copilot recognizes this is a TypeScript React project and generates suggestions using appropriate patterns and types.

## How Context Influences Suggestions

Context directly impacts the relevance, accuracy, and usefulness of GitHub Copilot's suggestions. More context generally leads to better suggestions.

### Example: Code Completion with Context

**Without Context** (only the current file open):

```typescript
// user.ts
function getUserById(id: string) {
  // Copilot might suggest generic database code
  const user = db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [id]);
  return user;
}
```

**With Context** (database utility file also open):

```typescript
// database.ts (open in another tab)
export async function queryOne<T>(sql: string, params: any[]): Promise<T | null> {
  // ... implementation
}

// user.ts (current file)
function getUserById(id: string) {
  // Copilot now suggests using the existing utility
  return queryOne<User>('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [id]);
}
```

By having the `database.ts` file open, Copilot recognizes the existing utility function and suggests using it instead of generating generic database code.

### Example: Chat with File References

**Without @-mention**:

```
You: How do I handle validation?

Copilot: Here's a general approach to validation...
[provides generic validation code]
```

**With #-mention**:

```
You: How do I handle validation in #user-service.ts?

Copilot: Based on your UserService class, you can add validation like this...
[provides code specific to your UserService implementation]
```

Using `#` to reference specific files gives Copilot precise context about which code you're asking about.

### Token Limits and Context Prioritization

GitHub Copilot has a maximum token limit for how much context it can process at once. When you have many files open or a long chat history, Copilot prioritizes:

1. **Closest proximity**: Code immediately surrounding your cursor
2. **Explicitly referenced files**: Files you @-mention in chat for CLI, and #-mention for IDEs (VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, etc.)
3. **Recently modified files**: Files you've edited recently
4. **Direct dependencies**: Files imported by your current file

Understanding this prioritization helps you optimize which files to keep open and when to use explicit references.

## Context Best Practices

Maximize GitHub Copilot's effectiveness by providing clear, relevant context:

**Keep related files open**: If you're working on a component, keep its test file, related utilities, and type definitions open in tabs or split views.

**Use descriptive names**: Choose clear variable names, function names, and class names that convey intent. `getUserProfile()` provides more context than `getData()`.

**Add clarifying comments**: For complex algorithms or business logic, write comments explaining the "why" behind the code. Copilot uses these to understand your intent.

**Structure your workspace logically**: Organize files in meaningful directories that reflect your application architecture. Clear structure helps Copilot understand relationships between components.

**Use #-mentions in chat**: When asking questions, explicitly reference files with `#filename` to ensure Copilot analyzes the exact code you're discussing.

**Provide examples in prompts**: When asking Copilot to generate code, include examples of your existing patterns and conventions.

## Common Questions

**Q: Does Copilot see my entire repository?**

A: No, Copilot doesn't automatically analyze all files in your repository. It focuses on open files, recently modified files, and files directly referenced by your current work. For large codebases, this selective approach ensures fast response times while still providing relevant context.

**Q: How do I know what context Copilot is using?**

A: In GitHub Copilot Chat, you can see which files are being referenced in responses. When Copilot generates suggestions, it's primarily using your currently open files and the code immediately surrounding your cursor. Using `#codebase` in chat explicitly searches across your entire repository.

**Q: Can I control what context is included?**

A: Yes, you have several ways to control context:
- Open/close files to change what's available to Copilot
- Use `#` mentions to explicitly reference specific files, symbols or functions
- Configure `.gitignore` to exclude files from workspace context
- Use instructions and skills to provide persistent context for specific scenarios

**Q: Does closing a file remove it from context?**

A: Yes, closing a file can remove it from Copilot's active context. However, files you've recently worked with may still influence suggestions briefly. For a clean context reset, you can restart your editor or start a new chat session.
