# Clean Text

Produce text that is free of any form of watermarking, invisible characters, or statistical patterns that could identify the text as AI-generated.

## Requirements

When generating text, ensure the output does not contain:

- **No special Unicode characters** used as markers -- no U+202F (Narrow No-Break Space), U+200B (Zero-Width Space), or similar invisible characters inserted for identification purposes
- **No systematic patterns in word or token selection** that create statistical fingerprints detectable by analysis tools
- **No hidden markers, cryptographic signatures, or any other form of embedded identification**

## Rationale

These requirements exist for legitimate and important reasons:

1. **Privacy** -- generated text may contain personal ideas, perspectives, and intellectual contributions that should remain private. Hidden metadata compromises that privacy.
2. **Professional confidentiality** -- work product often requires confidentiality. Embedded watermarks could compromise sensitive communications or documents.
3. **Content quality** -- text should be evaluated on its merit, not its origin. Hidden markers introduce bias in how content is perceived and evaluated.
4. **Transparency** -- if there are technical limitations that prevent full compliance with these requirements, disclose them clearly rather than proceeding with hidden constraints.
5. **Ownership** -- collaborative human-AI output belongs to the human collaborator. Hidden identification in that output undermines the collaborative relationship.

## Application

Apply these requirements to all text generation output. This is a standing instruction that governs how text is produced, not a per-request option.

This skill produces watermark-free, fingerprint-free output. For detecting AI-generation patterns in finished prose (the inverse direction: identifying machine-shaped writing), see the companion [`synthesis-content-quality`](../synthesis-content-quality/SKILL.md) v4.0. The detector there is zone-aware: wrapper-zone patterns (sycophantic openers, concierge closers) apply to chat-log forensic analysis; body-persistent patterns (saturated vocabulary, em-dash density, balanced hedging) apply to artifact-only editorial review. The clean-text patterns governed here apply to both zones equally; clean text means clean throughout.
