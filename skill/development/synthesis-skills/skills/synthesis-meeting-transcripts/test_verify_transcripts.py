"""Regression tests for verify_transcripts.py speaker/timestamp detection.

The completeness gate exists to make it impossible to save a meeting SUMMARY in
place of the verbatim transcript. That gate is only as good as its detectors, and
both directions of failure are costly:

  - False NEGATIVE (a summary passes) — the primary record is silently lost.
  - False POSITIVE (a real transcript fails) — the gate cries wolf, and an agent
    under time pressure learns to route around it. This is how fail-closed
    controls get disabled in practice.

Both live Plaud transcripts on 2026-08-04 were flagged INCOMPLETE despite carrying
98 and 163 timestamps of real diarized dialogue: v0.5.0 added Plaud support but
matched only the UNSPACED range form `[00:00-00:08]`, while Plaud actually emits
`**[00:00 - 00:08] Name:**` with spaces. These tests pin every real-world shape.

v0.5.2 (2026-08-06): a stale, orphaned plugin-cache copy (v4.9.0, predating v0.5.0
entirely) was run in place of the actually-installed v4.14.1 and produced 26
false-positive INCOMPLETE flags across a production corpus the current detector
reads as 0 incomplete. Individually re-verifying all 26 files during that incident
surfaced a SEPARATE, real undercounting bug: our agents annotate Plaud's numbered
speakers with an inferred-name parenthetical BEFORE the colon —
`**[10:10] Jordan Lee (Plaud Speaker 4, mapped):**` — which v0.5.1 did not handle
(it matched the timestamp + name, then required a colon immediately after the
name). Confirmed against a production corpus: dozens of undercounted lines in each
of several affected files. Every affected file still passed only because it had
enough OTHER unannotated lines to clear the threshold regardless — a file with a
different mix would have been a genuine false positive. These tests pin the
annotation format, AND pin that markdown field
headers sharing the "Word (parenthetical):" shape (e.g. "**Attendees (Invited):**")
do NOT start matching — the fix is scoped to the timestamp-led branch only,
specifically to avoid eroding precision on summary-only files.

v0.5.3 (2026-08-11) adds a THIRD failure direction, in the reporting layer rather
than the detector: `--only-incomplete` filtered the results list before the summary
counters were computed, so a clean corpus printed "Total: 0 files — 0 incomplete,
0 skipped, 0 no-source-transcript" — a clean bill of health rendered byte-identical
to "wrong path / no .md files found." Observed against a 282-file corpus that was
actually 0-incomplete, 2 skipped, 19 no-source-transcript; only reading the source
told the two apart. The daily ritual invokes the script with exactly that flag, so
the success case was the one that looked broken — the same way a control gets
distrusted, arriving from the opposite side of the false positives above. The
end-to-end checks below pin the split: counters and total describe the CORPUS, the
listing alone is filtered.
