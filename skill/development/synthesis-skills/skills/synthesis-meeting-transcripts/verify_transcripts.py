verify_transcripts.py — Detect meeting-transcript files that are missing
the full verbatim transcript section.

The synthesis-meeting-transcripts skill mandates that every saved meeting
file contains BOTH:
  1. Gemini notes (summary + paraphrased details + next steps)
  2. The verbatim word-for-word transcript with timestamps + speaker labels

This script enforces that by counting timestamp markers + speaker-attribution
lines in each file. A real Gemini transcript has timestamp markers every
~1-2 minutes (e.g., "00:01:31") and dozens of speaker-attribution lines
(`**Name:**` or `Name Surname:`). Summary-only files lack both.

Failure threshold (configurable): ≥5 timestamps + ≥10 speaker lines.

Skip rules (a file is NOT audited if any of these apply):
  - Filename starts with `_` — meta/documentation files (e.g., _BACKFILL_TODO.md)
  - Filename starts with `gdoc-` — Google Doc imports, not meeting transcripts
  - Filename starts with `email-` — synced email threads, not meetings
  - File contains the literal marker `<!-- VERIFIER: no-source-transcript -->` —
    explicitly tagged as a meeting where Gemini produced notes but NO verbatim
    transcript (Google Meet "Recording" mode without transcription enabled).
    Use this marker for files where the source-Doc legitimately has no
    transcript section to mirror locally.

Usage:
  python3 verify_transcripts.py <dir>
  python3 verify_transcripts.py <dir> --min-markers 10 --min-speakers 20
  python3 verify_transcripts.py <dir> --json
  python3 verify_transcripts.py <dir> --only-incomplete
  python3 verify_transcripts.py <dir> --no-skip       # audit ALL files (debug)

Reporting contract:
  `--only-incomplete` narrows which ROWS are listed. It never narrows the
  summary counters — those always describe the whole audited corpus, so a
  clean run reports "Total: 282 files — 0 incomplete, ..." rather than
  "Total: 0 files", which would be byte-identical to a wrong path. The same
  split holds in --json: `total_files` is the corpus, `listed_count` the rows.

Exit code:
  0 — all audited files have full transcripts
  1 — at least one audited file is incomplete (failures listed)
  2 — directory not found or no .md files

Wire this into:
  - synthesis-meeting-transcripts skill Step 4.5 (post-write verification)
  - synthesis-daily-rituals Day-Start Step 2b
  - Pre-commit hook (optional)

# so a stale copy is self-diagnosing: on 2026-08-06 an orphaned plugin-cache directory
# (v4.9.0, predating the v0.5.0 Plaud-format + undiarized-override fixes) was run in place of
# the actually-installed v4.14.1, producing 26 false-positive INCOMPLETE flags on a corpus the
# fixed detector reads as 0 incomplete. The script had no version banner, so nothing in its
# own output could reveal that the copy being run was stale. This constant plus the banner
# line below close that gap — if the printed version doesn't match SKILL.md's frontmatter
# version, the copy being run is not the one you think it is.

# Speaker attribution line at start of line, in any form Gemini, Plaud, or our agents use:
#   - Bolded full name:      **Name Surname:** text...   (newer Gemini output, our agent-curated)
#   - Unbolded full name:    Name Surname: text...       (older Gemini output, March-April vintage)
#   - Bolded first only:     **Name:** text...           (our agent-curated, brevity form)
#   - Plaud (timestamp-led): **[00:00] Name Surname:** text...  or  **[0:20] Speaker 2:** text...
#     Plaud puts a bracketed [MM:SS]/[H:MM:SS] BEFORE the name, so the older name-anchored
#     regex missed every Plaud dialogue line and flagged full Plaud transcripts as incomplete.
#     v0.5.1: Plaud emits SPACED ranges — `**[00:00 - 00:08] Name:**` — and the v0.5.0 pattern
#     only accepted the unspaced `[00:00-00:08]` form, so real Plaud transcripts still failed.
#     Whitespace around the separator is now optional, and en/em dashes are accepted alongside `-`.
#   - Plaud (timestamp-led, INFERRED SPEAKER): **[00:00] Name (Plaud Speaker N, mapped):** text...
#     or **[0:00] Name (Plaud Speaker 1 — inferred, high confidence: <reasoning>):** text... —
#     when Plaud only diarizes by number, our agents annotate the inferred real name with a
#     parenthetical BEFORE the colon. v0.5.1 had no path for this: the parenthetical broke the
#     match immediately after the name, silently undercounting speaker lines (dozens of lines
#     missed per affected file — confirmed 2026-08-06 against a production corpus). The affected
#     files still passed only because they happened to have enough OTHER unannotated lines; a
#     file with fewer bare-name lines and more annotated ones would have been a genuine false positive.
#     v0.5.2 accepts an optional "(...)" annotation, but ONLY on the timestamp-led branch — never
#     on the bare no-timestamp branch, where it would start matching ordinary markdown field
#     headers like "**Attendees (Invited):**" or "**Decision (Gemini "Aligned"):**" that appear
#     in genuinely summary-only files and would erode the detector's precision.
# A real verbatim transcript has dozens of these per file; a summary-only save has none.
# The high min-speakers threshold (default 10) ensures cumulative false positives from
# non-dialogue patterns can't push a summary-only file over.
