# Health check for the workspace-mcp auto-start service.
# Portable: macOS (launchd) and Linux (systemd user unit).
#
# Every other protective layer in the synthesis stack ships a health check;
# this one did not, which made it the fail-open control in a fail-closed
# stack. An auto-start service that dies stays dead silently: the supervisor
# retries on a throttle, the log fills with identical failures, and nothing
# surfaces until a task finally needs the server and finds it missing.
#
# The specific failure this exists to catch: the installed unit records an
# ABSOLUTE path to start.sh, captured at install time. Move the checkout,
# rename a directory, or restructure the repo, and the unit still points at
# the old path. The supervisor reports a configuration error, retries
# forever, and the only visible symptom is that the MCP tools are absent.
# install-autostart.sh derives the path correctly from its own location, so
# the fix is always "re-run the installer" — never "hand-edit the unit."
#
# Exit codes follow the synthesis guard contract:
#   0 — healthy
#   1 — defects found
#   2 — could not establish ground truth (a check that cannot run must never
#       look like a check that passed)
#
# Usage:
#   ./doctor.sh          # human-readable report
#   ./doctor.sh --quiet  # exit code plus a single summary line
