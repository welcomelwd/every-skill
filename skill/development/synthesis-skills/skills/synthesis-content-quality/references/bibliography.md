# Bibliography for synthesis-content-quality v4.0

**Purpose.** Consolidated source list for every empirical, theoretical, and journalistic claim referenced in the v4.0 catalog and its supporting references/ files. Each entry carries an explicit verification status.

**Verification labels.**

- **V** (Verified at expansion): independently fetched during the 2026-05-18 Opus-4.7 expansion pass; citation details and key numbers checked against the original.
- **W** (Web-verified): publicly accessible web page or trade press article whose existence and broad framing were confirmed.
- **C** (Cited only, `[unverified at expansion]`): referenced by one or more of the eight deep-research deliverables that fed the unified buckets but not independently fetched. Multiple-contributor convergence raises the prior; treat as "use with awareness" rather than "do not use."
- **U** (Unreachable): searched for and not located, or URL 404. Retained with label so future maintainers know not to rely on it.

**Em-dashes.** Zero em-dashes anywhere in this file, per criteria 11 and 42 of the parent skill.

**Anchor convention.** Pattern IDs: `A1-{FAMILY}-NNN` (model-family fingerprints), `A2-SUB-NNN` (substance and depth sub-patterns), `A3-NNN` or legacy 1 to 42 (refreshed criteria), `B1`, `B2-COMBO-NNN`, `B3` (cross-cutting layer).

## 7. Verification status totals

Total entries: 91.

- **V (Verified at expansion):** 6 entries. Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 75.
- **W (Web-verified):** 1 entry. Number 56.
- **C (Cited only):** 84 entries.
- **U (Unreachable):** 0 entries.

**V in practice.** Fetched the arxiv abstract or web page, confirmed authors / year / title / ID, confirmed broad framing matches source. Quoted numbers (Kobak 13.5 percent, Bitton 0.9988 precision) checked against abstract. V is not a full read or replication.

**C in practice.** At least one of the eight deep-research deliverables cited it. Multi-LLM convergence raises the prior but does not eliminate shared confabulation risk. C is "use with awareness," not "do not use."

**High-stakes use.** Claims resting on a single C source and consequential to legal, medical, or public-safety decisions should be re-verified against the primary source before publication.

## 8. Corrections and disambiguation log

**Correction 1: arxiv 2503.01659 attribution.** The original Claude exec summary called it "the Copyleaks arxiv 2503.01659 paper." It is by Bitton, Bitton, and Nisan (entry 4) and is NOT a Copyleaks publication.

**Correction 2: Claude Code Issue #3382 "106 occurrences" figure.** Attributed to the issue by the original Claude exec summary; the figure does NOT appear in the issue itself, which describes the pattern qualitatively ("a sizeable fraction of responses").

**Correction 3: arxiv numeric prefixes 2603.27006 and 2507.15849.** Unusual prefixes for 2026 papers in their respective months; may be mistranscribed. Verify before treating as anchors.

**Disambiguation 1: Liang 2023 vs Liang 2024.** Two distinct papers by Weixin Liang. Entry 2 is the 2023 ESL-bias paper (arxiv 2304.02819). Entry 19 is a separate 2024 Nature paper on LLM use in scientific papers.

**Disambiguation 2: Pangram references.** Entry 8 is the academic paper (Emi and Spero, arxiv 2402.14873). Entry 44 is the Pangram Labs blog and methodology page.

**Disambiguation 3: Kobak 2024 arxiv ID.** arxiv 2406.07016 belongs to Kobak (entry 1, verified). Future maintainers should verify the actual arxiv ID for Liang 2024 (entry 19) before propagating.

## 9. Extending this bibliography

When adding a source: pick the section, assign the next sequential number, apply the most accurate label (V, W, C, U), list anchor pattern IDs, add a correction note to section 8 if the new entry corrects a prior one, and self-audit for em-dashes before saving.

When downgrading: do not delete. Re-label as U with date and the verification step that failed. Add a correction note.
