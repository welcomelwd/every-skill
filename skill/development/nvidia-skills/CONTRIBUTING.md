# Contributing

This repository is a catalog of NVIDIA-verified agent skills. Skills are maintained by each product team in their own repos.

To contribute to a skill or propose a new one, use the contributing guidelines in the relevant source repo. See the [Skill Catalog](README.md#skill-catalog) and [Getting Help & Contributing](README.md#getting-help--contributing) sections in the README for links.

For changes to the catalog itself (fixing links, adding a new product listing), open a [pull request](../../pulls). For catalog-level bug reports, feature proposals, or documentation problems, file an [issue](../../issues/new/choose) using one of the catalog issue templates (Bug Report, Feature Request, Documentation Request or Correction). Questions and general discussion belong in [Discussions](../../discussions); security vulnerabilities follow the disclosure process in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Recommended Skill Directory Path

When publishing skills in a product repo, keep the source of truth in `skills/` at the repo root. This is the recommended default for product-owned or OSS skills, where skills are a first-class artifact.

Use `.agents/skills/` for installed skills that agents discover at runtime, or for repos that are intentionally structured as agent-readable skills packs.

Avoid agent-specific paths in the repo (`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`) for new entries — they create duplication. Existing products on those paths can keep them; `components.d/<slug>.yml` handles per-repo paths via the `skills[].path` field.

At install time, your tooling or packaging can copy or symlink from `skills/` into the appropriate agent discovery locations (for example `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`) as required by each tool.

## Discoverability Checklist (Source Repos)

GitHub search ranks repositories on metadata and engagement, not just content. Before (or right after) onboarding your skills to the catalog, check your source repo:

- [ ] **Repo description** names what developers search for: the product, the workflow, and "agent skills" (for example, "Agent skills for video search and summarization with VLMs and RAG"), not just the product name.
- [ ] **GitHub topics** are set (Settings → edit topics): include `agent-skills` plus your domain terms (`robotics`, `video-understanding`, `synthetic-data`, ...). Repos with no topics do not surface in topic browsing or filtered search.
- [ ] **README opens with a two-sentence value proposition** using those same search terms, before badges or tables of contents.
- [ ] **License is detected by GitHub**: the repo sidebar should show your license name. If it shows "Other" or "View license", GitHub could not parse your license file and the repo is excluded from license-filtered searches.
- [ ] **Social preview image** is set (Settings → Social preview, 1280×640) so shared links render a card instead of a blank tile.

These apply to the *source* repo; the catalog repo's own metadata is maintained by the catalog team.

## IP Review and License (External Skills)

For skills published to `github.com/nvidia/skills`, NVIDIA contributors confirm three things per onboarding PR:

1. The skills have been cleared for open source release per NVIDIA's internal IP review process (six-question check).
2. The skill is licensed under Apache 2.0, CC-BY 4.0, or dual-license (Apache 2.0 + CC-BY 4.0).
3. No new license or new third-party component has been introduced beyond what the source repo already carries.

NVIDIA contributors: see the internal onboarding guide for the IP review process details and license selection. The [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) prompts for these affirmations on every onboarding PR.

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

* If you forgot to sign off on earlier commits, retroactively sign all commits in your branch with:

  ```bash
  git rebase --signoff origin/main && git push --force-with-lease
  ```
