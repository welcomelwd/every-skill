# DOCA GPUNetIO ib_write_lat — Tasks

**Where to start:** The verbs that carry real workflow
content are `## configure`, `## build`, `## run`, `## test`,
and `## debug`. The other verbs (`install`, `modify`, `use`)
carry preconditions, refuses-to-patch routing, and the
use-side decision shape for a real-time / control-loop
workload class.

This file is loaded by [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) after
[`CAPABILITIES.md`](CAPABILITIES.md). It walks the agent
through the task verbs every artifact in this bundle exposes
(`install / configure / build / modify / run / test / debug /
use`), then defers task verbs that do not belong here.

## install

Goal: confirm the user's hosts (client AND server) have every
precondition the build + run sequence needs **before** any
GPUNetIO-specific work begins.

This skill does **not** own DOCA installation; that path
lives in [`doca-setup`](../../doca-setup/SKILL.md). The
`gpunetio_ib_write_lat`-specific preconditions:

1. **`doca-gpunetio.pc` is present.** Run
   `pkg-config --modversion doca-gpunetio`. If the `.pc`
   does not resolve, route to
   [`../../libs/doca-gpunetio/TASKS.md`](../../libs/doca-gpunetio/TASKS.md).
2. **`doca-common.pc` and `doca-rdma.pc` agree on the same
   DOCA semver** per the four-way match in
   [`doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](../../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility).
3. **CUDA Toolkit + `nvcc` are on the build host.** The
   shipped `common/kernel.cu` is compiled by `nvcc`;
   confirm the toolkit version is paired with the
   installed DOCA per the DOCA release notes (looked up
   via [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md)).
4. **`nvidia_peermem` kernel module is loaded.** Verify
   per
   [`../../libs/doca-gpunetio/CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy`](../../libs/doca-gpunetio/CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy)
   and
   [`doca-setup TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug).
5. **GPU visible to the host.** `nvidia-smi` lists the
   GPU and reports its PCIe bus ID.
6. **IB device visible to DOCA.** `doca_caps --list-devs`
   reports the IB device for `-d <ibdev>`.
7. **OOB connectivity exists between client and server**
   for the TCP exchange the source's connection helpers
   drive. Determine the OOB TCP port from the installed source or binary
   `--help` before changing a firewall; do not guess a port.

If any precondition fails, stop and route; tool-level
diagnosis against a half-installed environment wastes time. This applies
independently to client and server: if only one host passes, the pair is not
ready and no benchmark run starts.

## configure

Goal: pick the right GPU + IB device pair on each host,
commit to the runtime-surface choice, and prepare the build
tree.

Steps the agent walks the user through, in order:

1. **Commit to the runtime surface.** Walk
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   surface-selection table. The GPUNetIO vs GPI vs
   CPU-initiated choice is the load-bearing decision; do
   not silently default to GPUNetIO.
2. **Identify the GPU + IB device pair and check the
   pairing** on each host. `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=pci.bus_id`
   for the GPU; `ibdev2netdev -v` (or
   `doca_caps --list-devs`) for the IB device. The
   pairing is a hardware-topology precondition. Correlate both BDFs in
   `lspci -t` (and use `nvidia-smi topo -m` when that platform exposes the
   NIC) to verify they share the intended PCIe root or documented NVLink path;
   do not infer locality from device names alone.
3. **Confirm `nvidia_peermem`** per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes).
4. **Pick the GID index.** `--gid-index` is optional; the
   same index must be used on both client and server.
   GID-routing rules live in
   [`../../libs/doca-rdma/CAPABILITIES.md`](../../libs/doca-rdma/CAPABILITIES.md).
5. **Pick the client / server roles and the OOB IP.** The
   server is started first; the client is started with
   `-c <server-ip>`.
6. **Pick the workload's latency statistic UP FRONT.**
   Median, p99, p99.9, or jitter — per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   median-vs-p99-vs-jitter rule. The agent does NOT pick
   the statistic at quote time; the user picks it
   alongside the workload class at configure time.
7. **Confirm the build inputs.** `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` includes
   the install's `pkgconfig` directory per
   [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).

For the canonical DOCA universal lifecycle that underlies
program-side configuration, see
[`doca-programming-guide TASKS.md ## configure`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#configure).

## build

The tool is **not pre-built** under `/opt/mellanox/doca/`;
the user builds it from source under
`doca/tools/gpunetio_ib_write_lat/` against the installed
DOCA. The build pattern is the canonical `meson` flow:

1. **Set the right `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`** so `pkg-config`
   can find `doca-gpunetio.pc`, `doca-rdma.pc`, and
   `doca-common.pc`. The path lives under the DOCA
   `pkgconfig` directory documented in
   [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).
2. **Set up the build directory.** `meson setup
   <build-dir> doca/tools/gpunetio_ib_write_lat/` from
   the workspace root. The top-level `meson.build` wires
   together the `client/`, `server/`, and `common/`
   subtrees; the shared `common/` subtree carries the
   CUDA kernel (`kernel.cu`) and the OOB / lifecycle
   helpers shared by both halves.
3. **Compile.** `meson compile -C <build-dir>` produces
   the client and server binaries (target names declared
   in the per-subtree `meson.build`; re-read on the
   user's install).
4. **Smoke the build artifacts.** Run `<client-binary>
   --help` and `<server-binary> --help` before deploying.

Routing for nearby "build" questions:

- *"Can I build against a different DOCA than the one I
  have installed?"* → no; install the target DOCA first.
- *"I want to build my own GPUNetIO-based latency
  benchmark."* → route to
  [`../../libs/doca-gpunetio/TASKS.md`](../../libs/doca-gpunetio/TASKS.md)
  and
  [`doca-programming-guide TASKS.md ## build`](../../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#build).

The `## What this skill deliberately does not ship` block in
[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) forbids adding a verbatim build
recipe.

## modify

**Do not patch the shipped tool source tree.** The shipped
`client/`, `server/`, and `common/` subtrees are the
verified worked example. Modifying them puts the user in
contributor-to-DOCA territory.

What the agent *does* modify is the **build + invocation
environment** — `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, the GPU + IB device
pair, the GID index, the client / server roles, the OOB
IP, the run-time environment variables (`DOCA_LOG_LEVEL`,
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`), and NUMA pinning (`numactl`).
Treat *"modify the environment, not the source"* as the
operating mode.

Routing for nearby "modify" questions:

- *"The reported columns are inconvenient — can I change
  them?"* → source-level change; out of scope.
- *"I want to change the per-iteration timeout."* → the
  timeout is a kernel-side parameter the shipped source
  controls per `common/common.h`; changing it is a
  source-level change. If the user genuinely needs a
  different timeout, the right answer is *"author a
  bespoke benchmark against the GPUNetIO library"* per
  [`../../libs/doca-gpunetio/TASKS.md`](../../libs/doca-gpunetio/TASKS.md).
- *"I need a different metric than this tool reports."* →
  re-examine the runtime-surface choice in
  [`## configure`](#configure) step 1.

The smoke-before-bulk flow:

1. **Confirm the build artifacts and the environment**
   per [`## install`](#install) and
   [`## configure`](#configure).
2. **Bring up the server first.** On the chosen host,
   run the `server` binary without `-c`. The server
   listens on the OOB TCP socket.
3. **Confirm the server's pre-run echo.** The tool logs
   the IB device name, the GPU PCIe address, the GID
   index, and the role.
4. **Bring up the client.** On the second host, run the
   `client` binary with `-c <server-ip>`, the chosen
   `-d` and `--gpu` on the client side, and the same
   `--gid-index` if a non-default was used on the
   server.
5. **Read the single-iteration smoke output.** The result
   line carries `#bytes`, `#iterations`, `t_half_iter`,
   `t_full_iter`, `t_cuda` per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](CAPABILITIES.md#observability).
   Verify the numbers are in a defensible order of
   magnitude for the GPU-NIC pair. If anything looks off,
   loop back to [`## debug`](#debug).
6. **Determine whether the installed tool can support the requested
   statistic.** Inspect the source and actual stdout. A meaningful p99 /
   p99.9 needs raw samples and enough iterations to populate the tail
   (typical rule of thumb: at least 10^5 samples for p99, 10^6 for p99.9;
   the exact threshold is workload-class-specific). `NUM_ITER` is a source
   constant unless the installed interface proves otherwise; do not promise
   that the operator can raise it at runtime.
7. **Capture the complete stdout.** If it contains only aggregate rows, report
   them as aggregate rows and route an in-run percentile request to a bespoke
   benchmark. Do not relabel `t_cuda` or one result row as raw per-iteration
   samples.

When recording the run for downstream consumers, write
down: `pkg-config --modversion doca-gpunetio`,
`nvcc --version`, host OS / kernel / NUMA topology /
firmware on each side, GPU model + PCIe address on each
side, IB device model + PCIe address on each side, GID
index, exact client and server command lines, the chosen
latency statistic (median / p99 / p99.9 / jitter), and
the full unredacted stdout for both halves.

## test

`gpunetio_ib_write_lat` is a **measurement tool**, so its
`## test` verb is about *testing the measurement* —
confirming the numbers are sound and reproducible — not
unit-testing the tool.

**`## test` is an iterative loop.** A run that completes
is not the same as a run that produced a defensible
distribution; each iteration tightens one axis of
measurement soundness.

The eval-loop overlay:

| Iteration trigger | What it looks like | What changes next iteration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Smoke completes; median is far below the NIC's documented one-way latency floor | Likely a measurement artifact — possibly the CUDA-side timer is reporting wall time that does not include the full WR-completion observation | Cross-check the CUDA-side number against the host-side `t_full_iter`; re-walk the warm-up rule. |
| Median fine, but p99 is many multiples of the median | Tail latency is real — this IS the answer the operator is looking for if the workload is real-time | Quote the p99 as the answer; capture the tail-event count alongside; do NOT average it away. |
| Iteration count reported is lower than the source constant | One hypothesis is that the kernel-side timeout compiled into the source was too short and iterations were dropped | Verify the cause from installed source and logs. The shipped interface does not document a timeout runtime option; if a different timeout is required, route to a bespoke benchmark rather than claiming a run-config change. |
| Same invocation produces different distributions across two hosts at the same DOCA version | NUMA / firmware / driver delta below DOCA | Capture the tuple on both hosts; route through [`doca-version TASKS.md ## test`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#test) and [`doca-setup TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug). |
| Same invocation produces different distributions on the same host across DOCA versions | Regression signal — provided both tuples are captured | Route to [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug). |
| Distribution shifts when the operator runs anything else on the GPU concurrently | The benchmark's measurement is corrupted by concurrent SM activity | Re-run with the GPU at idle (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` isolation, `nvidia-smi` to confirm no other processes). |

The agent's rule: every change to the environment re-opens
the loop. Re-running with a different GID index, NUMA
pinning, or firmware level without re-walking the
distribution is exactly the failure mode this loop
replaces. Bound the loop to one corrective rerun per changed axis. If that
rerun remains unsound, capture both attempts and route to `## debug` or the
owning cross-cutting skill; do not continue tuning indefinitely.

**Baseline-capture rule.** The captured artifact includes
the multi-axis tuple per
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy`](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy)
alongside the stdout from both halves AND the chosen
latency statistic (median / p99 / p99.9 / jitter). A
distribution captured without the statistic is half an
artifact.

## debug

When `gpunetio_ib_write_lat` fails to build, bring up, or
produce a defensible distribution, walk the
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
layers in order:

1. **Config-syntax.** Confirm flags exist in `--help` on
   the installed binaries.
2. **Build-time.** Re-route through
   [`## build`](#build) and the GPUNetIO library skill's
   install verification.
3. **GPU-NIC pairing.** Re-walk
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   GPU-NIC pairing rule.
4. **GPUNetIO-lifecycle.** Most common cause:
   `nvidia_peermem` not loaded. Route to
   [`../../libs/doca-gpunetio/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy`](../../libs/doca-gpunetio/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy).
5. **RDMA-connection.** Confirm GID index matches;
   confirm RDMA permissions include WRITE; route to
   [`../../libs/doca-rdma/CAPABILITIES.md`](../../libs/doca-rdma/CAPABILITIES.md).
6. **Measurement-soundness.** Walk the
   [`## test`](#test) eval loop; confirm warm-up applied;
   verify any timeout/drop hypothesis from source or logs; confirm the
   requested statistic is actually derivable from the emitted data.
7. **Version.** Cross-cutting partial-install /
   mixed-version. Walk
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug).
8. **Cross-cutting.** Hand off to
   [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug)
   and
   [`doca-setup TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug).

In every case: **quote what the binaries reported.** Do
not paraphrase, do not collapse the distribution into a
single number.

## use

Goal: turn a captured latency distribution into a
class-of-workload decision — *"is the GPUNetIO path the
right runtime surface for my real-time / control-loop
workload?"*.

The decision shape this skill teaches:

1. **Quote the right statistic.** Median for typical-case,
   p99 / p99.9 for deadline-bound real-time, jitter for
   predictability-bound. Quoting a single number without
   naming the statistic is the cross-tool comparison
   failure mode.
2. **Compare against the right alternative.** If the
   workload class is *"GPU-initiated WRITE for a real-time
   control loop"*, the alternative this benchmark
   answers is *"the same pattern on the GPI surface"*
   per the [`doca-gpi`](../../libs/doca-gpi/SKILL.md)
   library (there is no shipped GPI `ib_write_lat`
   benchmark binary in `doca/tools/`);
   if the alternative is *"the same pattern on the host
   CPU"*, the comparison data has to come from the
   upstream CPU-initiated `perftest` `ib_write_lat`
   separately.
3. **Apply the GPU-NIC pairing precondition to the
   downstream design.** A latency that wins on this
   benchmark only carries over to production if the
   production GPU-NIC pair sits on the same PCIe /
   NVLink topology as the test bed.
4. **Account for the latency-vs-batching trade-off.**
   Per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   latency-vs-batching trade-off, the per-WR latency this
   benchmark reports reflects the shipped batching
   configuration. The user's production code may batch
   differently; the right *final* answer for a real-time
   deadline comes from an application-level test that
   matches the production batching shape.
5. **Per-release re-verification.** Every DOCA upgrade
   and every CUDA Toolkit upgrade requires re-running
   the benchmark before re-quoting the distribution.
6. **Hand off to the application's own benchmark for the
   real-time deadline.** This tool measures the WR
   latency through GPUNetIO; the user's full control
   loop sits *above* one WR and has its own latency
   contributors (compute on the GPU between WRs,
   host-side handoffs, scheduling jitter). The right
   *final* answer for a real-time deadline is an
   application-level benchmark.
