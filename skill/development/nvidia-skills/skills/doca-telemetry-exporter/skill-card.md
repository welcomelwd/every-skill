## Description: <br>
Use this skill when the user is doing hands-on DOCA Telemetry Exporter programming on a host where DOCA is installed — defining a doca_telemetry_exporter_schema and event types, creating sources, picking a publish surface (typed events / opaque events / the metrics counter-gauge-histogram API / OTLP logs / NetFlow), walking the schema-then-source lifecycle, or debugging DOCA_ERROR_* failures from the exporter API. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
External developers and engineers building DOCA applications that emit structured telemetry (counters, gauges, events) through the DOCA Telemetry Exporter C library to an external consumer. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
4 evaluation tasks (3 positive, 1 negative) from skill-evaluator-dataset-snapshot/1, each in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Whether the skill is safe to use (unsafe operations, secret leakage, unauthorized access). <br>
- Correctness: Whether the answer produced is correct against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Whether the right skill was loaded and activated when needed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Whether the skill helped complete the user's goal and expected workflow. <br>
- Efficiency: Whether the skill avoided wasted tool or skill usage. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Verifies the expected skill was found and executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Measures routing quality, workspace-aware skill reads, and productive tool use. <br>
- `accuracy`: Checks final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Verifies whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Verifies whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
