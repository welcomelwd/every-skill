# DOCA debug — capabilities, version compatibility, errors, observability, safety

**Where to start:** The 7-layer table in
[`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) is the load-bearing
content of this file. Identify the layer first, then drill into the
matching section. The pattern overview below names the recurring debug
families across all 7 layers.

Read this file when the loader sent you here from [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). For the step-by-step workflows that *use* the surface described here, see [TASKS.md](TASKS.md). For env-class equivalents (install / build prerequisites, env-class errors, env observability), see [`doca-setup`](../doca-setup/SKILL.md). For program-class equivalents (the cross-library `DOCA_ERROR_*` taxonomy, `doca_error_get_descr()`, the universal lifecycle), see [`doca-programming-guide`](../doca-programming-guide/SKILL.md). For where to find official documentation or the on-disk install layout, route through [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).

This file describes the **shape of every DOCA debug surface** — which kinds of debug exist, which version of DOCA exposes which surface, how DOCA reports errors that the agent must interpret, what DOCA emits that the agent can observe, and what safety constraints the agent must respect *while* debugging. Library-specific overlays (Flow pipe traces, RDMA queue-pair stats, Comch channel statistics, etc.) live in the matching library skill; this file is the cross-cutting reference they all build on.

## Pattern overview

Every cross-cutting debug task this skill teaches resolves into one
of FIVE patterns. Reach for the pattern first; the H2 below it carries
the substance. The patterns are CLASSES — they apply across every
DOCA library, service, and tool, regardless of which layer triggered.

| Pattern | Class shape | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Layer identification | Symptom → which of the 7 layers (install / version / build / link / runtime / program / driver) | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) 7-layer table |
| 2. Read-only-first capture | Capture the *current* state with no side effects before any mutation (gdb attach, mod reload, eswitch change, …) | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) read-only stance |
| 3. Verbosity escalation | Raise log levels / switch to trace flavor to make hidden state observable | [`## Observability`](#observability) trace-flavor + `--sdk-log-level` |
| 4. Reproducer assembly | Package state + steps + versions so someone else (forum / colleague) can repro | [TASKS.md ## test](TASKS.md#test) capture-a-reproducible-state |
| 5. Hand-off / escalation | When the symptom is library-internal, env-class, or needs upstream, route to the right next skill / channel | [TASKS.md ## debug](TASKS.md#debug) "Where to ask for help" + cross-skill routing |

Two cross-cutting rules:

- **Identify the layer before the tool.** Running `gdb` on a process
  that won't link, or `dmesg` on a `pkg-config` failure, is the most
  common waste of debug effort. The 7-layer table below is the
  layer-classifier the agent must consult first.
- **Read-only before state-changing.** Every layer has at least one
  read-only entry point (`doca_caps --list-devs`,
  `pkg-config --modversion`, `cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge`,
  `ip link show`). The state-changing actions (gdb attach, module
  reload, eswitch flip) come *after* the read-only picture is
  captured, never as the first move.

## Capabilities and modes

DOCA debug is **layered**. Each layer has its own surface, its own tools, and its own kind of evidence. The agent must identify which layer the symptom belongs to *before* recommending any tool — running `gdb` on a process that won't link, or reading `dmesg` for a `pkg-config` failure, wastes the user's time and obscures the real problem.

| Layer | What goes wrong here | First evidence to capture | Owning skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Install** | Package missing, package incomplete, wrong arch, partial upgrade. | `dpkg -l` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `rpm -qa` (RHEL/Rocky) for `doca-*` packages; `ls /opt/mellanox/doca` for tree presence. | [`doca-setup ## debug`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug) layers 1–2. |
| **Version** | Host-package version, BFB version, header version, runtime `*.so` version not aligned. | `pkg-config --modversion doca-common`, `cat /opt/mellanox/doca/applications/VERSION`, `doca_caps --version`. All three should agree. | [`doca-setup ## debug`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug) layer 3 + [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## Where to find the version`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#where-to-find-the-version). |
| **Build** | `pkg-config` cannot find module, header not found, missing experimental-API flag. | `pkg-config --list-all \| grep doca`, the failing compile command, the exact error string. | [`doca-setup ## debug`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug) layer 4 + [`doca-programming-guide ## build`](../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#build). |
| **Link** | `undefined reference to doca_*`, missing `-l` flag for one of DOCA's split libraries (Flow ships as 5 separate `*.so`s on recent versions). | `pkg-config --libs doca-<library>`, `ldd` of the failing binary if it produced one. | This skill — see *Link-time debug* in `TASKS.md ## debug`. |
| **Runtime** | Program runs but does nothing on the wire, or returns `DOCA_ERROR_*` from a runtime call. | `--sdk-log-level 70` (TRACE) + the trace build flavor; per-library inspector tools (`doca-flow-tune`, etc.). | This skill — see *Runtime debug* in `TASKS.md ## debug`. Library-specific overlays in matching library skill. |
| **Program** | Lifecycle out of order (e.g. `start` before `init`), `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE` returned, validate-before-commit skipped. | `doca_error_get_descr(err)` quoted verbatim from the program's logs; the actual call sequence. | [`doca-programming-guide ## debug`](../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#debug). |
| **Driver / firmware** | `DOCA_ERROR_DRIVER` returned. The layer below DOCA reported failure. | `dmesg \| tail` (kernel-side), `mlxconfig -d <pci> q` (firmware capability snapshot), `devlink dev show`. | [`doca-setup ## debug`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug) layer 5 — DOCA cannot fix what the driver below it reports. |

The agent's rule: **always start at the lowest layer the symptom is consistent with, not the highest**. Most "first DOCA app" failures are install / version / build problems wearing the costume of a runtime error. A bad `pkg-config` returns a successful binary that fails to link; a header from one DOCA version compiled against a runtime from another version returns `DOCA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE` from a call that should never fail.

**Read-only entry points exist at every layer.** Each layer above has at least one side-effect-free probe — `doca_caps --list-devs`, `pkg-config --modversion doca-common`, `cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge`, `ip link show`. The *capture-first, mutate-second* discipline that governs **when** to run these versus the state-changing actions (`gdb` attach, kernel-module reload, eswitch-mode change) is owned by [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy) item 1; this layer map only marks which probes are safe to run first.

**Container vs native runtime.** Inside the NGC DOCA container ([`doca-setup ## no-install`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install) Path 0), debug is constrained: the container can introspect its own process tree, its own logs, its own DOCA install — but it cannot read host kernel state (`dmesg` shows the container's view, which is empty for hardware events on the host) and it cannot see the host's network devices unless explicitly mapped in. For runtime symptoms involving real packets / real hardware, move to a native install (Path B/C), or write captures to an operator-approved host bind mount and extract existing logs/dumps with the container runtime's documented copy command. Do not add privileged device or host-filesystem mappings merely for debug. Debugging a Flow pipe in an unmapped container is build/link only.

## Version compatibility

For the canonical DOCA version-detection chain, the four-way match rule, NGC container semantics, the headers-win-over-docs rule, and the routing to the DOCA Compatibility Policy, see [`doca-version`](../doca-version/SKILL.md). The body lives there; this skill does not duplicate it.

**The debug-side overlay** is that debug tooling itself is *versioned* — a capability the agent reaches for may not exist on the user's installed train. The agent must quote the verified installed version (from [`doca-version TASKS.md ## configure`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#configure)) BEFORE recommending any debug surface below.

**BFB-version probe ban (same as in `doca-version`).** When the user's debug session is about a BFB / BlueField-Arm-side question (debug of a workload running on the DPU, BFB upgrade fallout, BlueField networking misconfiguration), the BFB-image DOCA version is read with `bfver` plus `cat /etc/mlnx-release` on the BlueField Arm console — NOT with `mlxprivhost` (configures privileged-host mode, not version) and NOT with `bfb-info` (not a real NVIDIA-documented tool). Both are common hallucinations even when the visible-but-wrong binary is on the host's `/usr/bin/`. See [`doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes).

| Debug surface | First DOCA version it shipped in | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `doca_caps` CLI (capability snapshot, side-effect-free) | DOCA 2.6.0. | `which doca_caps` and `doca_caps --version`. Older trains: capability discovery had to go through the per-library API. See [`doca-caps`](../tools/doca-caps/SKILL.md). |
| `doca-flow-trace` `pkg-config` module (trace build flavor of Flow) | Available across recent DOCA trains; the runtime location of the trace `*.so` is documented in [`doca-setup CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](../doca-setup/CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes). | `pkg-config --exists doca-flow-trace`. Per-library trace flavors follow the same `doca-<library>-trace` pattern when they exist. |
| Flow Inspector Service (Flow-specific mirrored-flow debug surface) | **Not covered by this bundle** — the Flow Inspector Service is policy-excluded from this public release; documented per the public Flow Inspector Service guide. | Route to the public docs via [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md). |
| `doca-flow-tune` tool (Flow visibility / analysis) | Alpha at the time of the public guide; may rev. | Listed in [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA tools`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-tools); verify on the user's install with `which doca-flow-tune` (or whatever the binary name is on their train). |
| `doca-bench` (performance evaluation) | Listed in the public DOCA tools index. | See [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA tools`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-tools). |
| `DOCA_VERSION_MAJOR / MINOR / PATCH` macros (in `doca_version.h`) | Header has been part of the public surface across recent trains. Use these macros in user code rather than parsing version strings. | `grep -RH 'DOCA_VERSION_' "$(pkg-config --variable=includedir doca-common)/"` to confirm presence on the user's install. |

**The version string is descriptive, not predictive.** Do not infer downstream patch lineage from the shape of a version string (e.g. *"3.3.0 must be newer than 3.1.0-LTS"* — LTS trains backport bug fixes on their own cadence and may release later than a numerically-higher GA). Mixing GA and LTS trains is a [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug) layer-2 diagnosis, not a debug-tooling question.

## Error taxonomy

The cross-library `DOCA_ERROR_*` taxonomy is **owned** by [`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy). This skill does not redefine it; it only adds the *debug-side framing* the agent needs when interpreting an error from logs.

Three rules every debug session must follow:

1. **Quote `doca_error_get_descr(err)` verbatim.** Every DOCA library exposes this function. Its return is the library's own canonical statement of what went wrong; never paraphrase it from memory or invent a description from the error name. If the user's program does not log the descriptor, instrument it (see [`doca-programming-guide ## modify`](../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#modify) for how to add diagnostics to a sample) before forming any hypothesis.

2. **Map the error family to the right debug layer.** A `DOCA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE` is a *program* bug (wrong argument); a `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE` is a *lifecycle* bug (wrong call order); a `DOCA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` is a *capability* bug (this hardware/firmware can't); a `DOCA_ERROR_DRIVER` is a *layer-below-DOCA* bug. The taxonomy in `doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy` names which family routes to which layer; this skill's `## debug` ladder consumes that mapping.

3. **Never paper over an error with a retry loop.** `DOCA_ERROR_TIME_OUT` may genuinely be timing-related, but any retry must use a documented operation-specific bound and backoff; if no bound is documented, do not retry automatically. Once that bound is exhausted, capture the unchanged result and advance the debug loop. `DOCA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE`, `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE`, `DOCA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`, `DOCA_ERROR_INITIALIZATION`, and `DOCA_ERROR_DRIVER` will not become success on retry. Retrying these masks the bug and produces logs that are harder to debug than the original failure.

The env-class error surface (missing `*.pc`, hugepages not mounted, representor not visible) is **separate** and lives in [`doca-setup CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](../doca-setup/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy). The debug ladder always starts at the env layer; do not begin program-side debug until the env-side errors are clear.

## Observability

DOCA emits a fixed observability surface that every library inherits and every library can extend. The agent's job in any debug session is to *turn the surface up* before forming hypotheses — most "I can't see what's happening" symptoms are a default log level too low, not an actual missing surface.

**The cross-library logging surface.** DOCA libraries log via the `doca_log_register_*` API and emit to `stderr` by default. The verbosity is controlled by *one* of:

- The CLI flag `--sdk-log-level <level>` on any DOCA tool / sample / application that accepts it.
- The environment variable `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL` for programs that read it (verify in the program; not all do).
- The programmatic call `doca_log_backend_set_sdk_level(<level>)` from inside the program.

Log levels (numeric, on the public Programming Guide):

- `30` = `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL_INFO` — quiet, production default.
- `50` = `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG` — useful debug detail.
- `70` = `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL_TRACE` — every call traced; the right setting for any *first run of any new code path* and for any debug session whose first hypothesis is "I don't see enough."

For a side-effect-free smoke-test entry point (when the agent wants to confirm DOCA is *callable* without doing anything visible), prefer `doca_log_*` over a real lifecycle call. Logging initialization is harmless and exercises the library binding without touching hardware.

**The trace build flavor.** Linking a library against `pkg-config doca-<library>-trace` (instead of `doca-<library>`) selects the trace flavor of that library, which adds runtime input-sanitation and emits additional log lines at `DEBUG` / `TRACE` level. The release flavor does not emit those lines no matter how high you set `--sdk-log-level`, because the additional checks aren't compiled in. Use the trace flavor during development and any debug session; switch to release for performance measurements (see [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy)).

**Capability snapshots.** `doca_caps` (the CLI tool, see [`doca-caps`](../tools/doca-caps/SKILL.md)) is a side-effect-free snapshot of "what DOCA sees on this host right now." Capture it at the start of any debug session — capabilities can change between runs (firmware reflash, eswitch mode change, kernel-module reload), and a stale capability picture is a leading cause of *"it worked yesterday."*

**Library-specific surfaces.** Pipe counters (Flow), queue-pair statistics (RDMA), channel send/recv counters (Comch), tracing dumps (per library), and inspector tools (`doca-flow-tune`) are owned by the matching library skill. The library skill names the call (e.g. `doca_flow_resource_query_entry`) and the right cadence to query it.

**Standard Linux observability the agent can reach for alongside DOCA.** Read-only and always available on a healthy install:

- `dmesg | tail -100` — kernel-side device events, `mlx5_core` driver messages, link state changes.
- `journalctl -u <service> -e` — for DOCA services (DMS, DTS, etc.) running under SystemD.
- `ip link show`, `ip addr show`, `ethtool <iface>`, `devlink dev show` — interface and device visibility.
- `cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge`, `mount | grep huge` — hugepage state.
- `ldd /path/to/binary`, `nm -D /opt/mellanox/doca/lib*/libdoca_<lib>.so` — link-layer introspection.
- `lsmod | grep mlx`, `modinfo mlx5_core` — kernel-module state.
- `strace -e trace=openat -f <command>` — what files the program is trying to open (catches missing-config-file failures fast).

**Service log paths.** DOCA services configure their own log destinations (not always `stderr`). Check `/var/log/doca*`, `/var/log/syslog`, or the service's own README before assuming output is missing.

## Universal debug-loop contract

Every answer that diagnoses a symptom (build error, link error, runtime error, `DOCA_ERROR_*`, segfault, hang, *"does nothing on the wire"*, *"counter didn't increment"*, *"my program is misbehaving"*) MUST instantiate the **5-phase debug-loop contract** below. This is the bundle-wide shape that every per-library `## debug` redirects to. Pointing at the 7-layer ladder once and stopping is the failure mode this contract replaces; debug is **iterative**, not single-shot.

| Phase | What the agent must do | Why this phase exists | Forbidden shortcut |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Layer identification** | Name the *lowest* layer in the 7-layer ladder from [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) the symptom is consistent with (install / version / build / link / runtime / program / driver). Cite the layer by name. Identification is mechanical: an `undefined reference to doca_*` is initially classified as layer 4 (Link), regardless of the user's interpretation, but the mandatory version-chain capture in phase 2 must rule out layer-2 skew before any link-line mutation. | Most "first DOCA app" failures are install / version / build / link problems wearing the costume of a runtime error. Starting at the highest plausible layer is the single most expensive debug mistake. | Starting at runtime ("let's add print statements") when a build/link layer has not been ruled out. |
| **2. Read-only capture (the triple)** | Capture the full triple from [`TASKS.md ## test`](TASKS.md#test) step 3 at the identified layer **before any mutation**: (a) program output (`stderr` + `--sdk-log-level 70` trace), (b) system view (`dmesg \| tail -200`, `journalctl --since "5 min ago"`, the matching service log dir), (c) DOCA view (`doca_caps --list-devs` for capability snapshot + `pkg-config --modversion doca-<library>` for version re-confirmation). Name the three commands explicitly. **Absent-`doca_caps` rule for (c).** If `doca_caps` is not on PATH where `pkg-config --modversion doca-common` succeeds, record `doca_caps absent (partial install — see doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility)`. A per-library C capability probe may substitute only when that exact probe already exists in an installed shipped sample or the user's existing program; run it unchanged or with the sample's documented arguments. Never generate probe code from an API-name pattern. If no existing probe/sample is present, the capability view remains unavailable and the session routes to [`doca-setup ## configure`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure) to install the documented tools/samples component or repair the install before capability-dependent diagnosis continues. If `pkg-config --modversion doca-common` also fails, record the exact probe failure as the DOCA view, classify the install as absent or broken, and route to layer 1; do not compile a fallback probe or fabricate capability data. | A hypothesis formed without the captured triple is a guess. The triple is the artifact the rest of the loop iterates on; without it the agent cannot tell *what changed*. | Forming a hypothesis from the user's prose description alone, without the triple in hand. Inventing `doca_caps` output or generating replacement C probe code when the binary is absent. |
| **3. Single-variable hypothesis change** | Apply **exactly one** mutation at the identified layer (one log-level bump, one `pkg-config` fix, one lifecycle reorder, one `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` swap, one capability check before commit). Name the mutation explicitly. If the user is the operator, the agent prescribes the single mutation; if the agent is the operator, it applies and pauses. | Multi-variable changes destroy the ability to attribute the result. A session that mutates three things and the symptom disappears has not learned which mutation was the fix and is not done. | Bundling several mutations into one "try these" list and asking the user to report back if any of them worked. |
| **4. Re-capture and compare** | Re-run the exact same triple from phase 2. Compare against the baseline capture. There are three possible outcomes: (a) **symptom unchanged** — the hypothesis was wrong **or** the layer was wrong; go to phase 5 outcome `unchanged`; (b) **symptom shape changed** — the mutation took effect; go to phase 5 outcome `shape-changed`; (c) **symptom resolved** — the green signal appears; go to phase 5 outcome `resolved`. | The mutation is not evidence — the *re-capture* is. Without the side-by-side compare, the agent cannot distinguish "the fix worked" from "the symptom was already intermittent." | Asking the user *"did it work?"* without re-running the same capture commands. |
| **5. Exit condition or loop** | Resolve to one of three exits: (a) **resolved** — name the green signal (the specific metric / log / counter / status field that confirms healthy state, per the universal verification contract step 5); the session is done; (b) **shape-changed** — loop back to phase 1 with the *new* symptom (a layer-3 fix often unmasks a layer-5 symptom; re-identify the layer for the new picture, do not assume the prior layers are still clean); (c) **unchanged** — loop back to phase 1, the layer was wrong; try the next-lowest layer the symptom is consistent with. If the ladder exhausts at layer 7 (driver/firmware) with no green signal, escalate to the DOCA Developer Forum (see [`TASKS.md ## debug`](TASKS.md#debug) *"Where to ask for help"*) with the captured triples from every iteration. | The most common failure mode is declaring done at phase 3 ("I applied the fix") without re-capturing in phase 4 and without naming the green signal in phase 5. *"I applied the fix"* is not a green signal; the named metric reading the expected value is. | Declaring the bug fixed after the mutation is applied, without re-capturing the triple and without naming what *"green"* looks like. |

**Termination invariant.** An `unchanged` result advances strictly to
the next plausible layer toward layer 7. A `shape-changed` result may
restart at layer 1 only when the re-captured triple is materially
different from the prior triple; otherwise it is `unchanged`. Never
revisit the same `(symptom, layer, triple)` state. If a sequence of
shape changes returns to a previously captured state, stop and
escalate with the cycle's captures rather than looping again.

**Stacking rule.** When a per-library `## debug` anchor is loaded (e.g. [`doca-flow ## debug`](../libs/doca-flow/TASKS.md#debug)), the library-specific overlay **layers on top of** the universal contract — it does not replace it. The agent runs both: the universal 5 phases as the spine, the library-specific overlay as the per-phase instantiation (e.g. for Flow: phase 2's DOCA view also includes the `doca_flow_query_pipe_miss` / `doca_flow_query_entry` / `doca_flow_shared_resources_query` counter family — not a synthesized `doca_flow_aggr_query`; the lib's `CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability` enumerates the actual counter family for that release).

**Cross-cutting layering.** When `doca-version` is also loaded (see the activation triggers in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md#cross-cutting-overlay-activation-triggers)), phase 2 (Read-only capture) MUST include the four-source detection chain from [`doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes) in the DOCA view, not just `pkg-config --modversion`. When `doca-hardware-safety` is also loaded, phase 3 (Single-variable hypothesis change) is constrained: any mutation that touches hardware state (kernel-module reload, eswitch flip, hugepage change, PCIe rebind, `mlxconfig` write) must follow the pre-flight inventory → apply → verify → rollback discipline from [`doca-hardware-safety TASKS.md ## configure`](../doca-hardware-safety/TASKS.md#configure); a single-variable hypothesis that lacks a documented rollback is forbidden, not deferred.

**Relationship to the verification contract.** The debug-loop contract and the [universal verification contract](../doca-setup/CAPABILITIES.md#universal-verification-contract) are siblings. Verification is *"I am applying a change; how do I prove it worked?"* — the loop terminates when the green signal appears at production scale. Debug is *"the system is misbehaving; how do I find the cause?"* — the loop terminates when the green signal appears at the smallest reproducible scope. Both end at the same kind of named, observable signal; both refuse *"done"* without one.

## Safety policy

Debug actions can themselves change the system. The agent must distinguish read-only debug from state-changing debug, and follow a *capture-first, mutate-second* discipline.

1. **Always capture state before mutating it.** Before changing a log level, attaching `gdb`, reloading a kernel module, or modifying any environment, run the read-only snapshot first: `doca_caps --list-devs`, `pkg-config --modversion doca-common`, `dmesg | tail -100`, `mount | grep huge`, `ip link show`. Save the output. Mutation is allowed *after* this snapshot exists, never before.

2. **Do not modify the install tree (`/opt/mellanox/doca/lib*/`) during debug.** It is the release. Build flavor changes go via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or the `-trace` `pkg-config` module, never by editing `lib/`. If you find yourself wanting to patch a `.so` to debug it, stop — the symptom is not in the `.so` (which is the same binary every other DOCA user has); it's in the program's interaction with it.

3. **`gdb` attach pauses the process.** A debugger that stops at a breakpoint can starve a watchdog, miss a heartbeat, drop a network connection, or confuse a peer that expects timely responses. For server-class workloads, prefer non-pausing observability (logs, traces, counters) and reach for `gdb` only when those are exhausted. For client-class workloads, attaching is fine; just be aware the wall-clock view will lie.

4. **The trace build flavor has measurable overhead.** It is invaluable while learning the API surface and during any active debug session, but it adds runtime cost that distorts performance measurements. Switch back to the release flavor (`pkg-config doca-<library>` without the `-trace` suffix) before any performance reading is taken seriously, and document the switch.

5. **Core dumps may contain sensitive payload data.** A `gcore` or post-crash dump from a DOCA program processing real traffic includes packet contents in the program's memory. Treat dumps as confidential by default; do not paste them into public forum posts without redaction.

6. **Container debug cannot see the host kernel.** The container-vs-native introspection limit — in-container `dmesg` / `journalctl` / `/sys` return the container's view, not the host's — is described in [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) under *Container vs native runtime*. The safety consequence: for any symptom about a device disappearing or an interface dropping, reach a host shell (or the container's host-side companion tooling) before forming hardware-event hypotheses, or debugging from inside the container will mislead.

7. **Env mutations are global.** Hugepage changes, eswitch mode changes, `mlxconfig` resets, BFB updates — all are *global system state* and may affect other users / other tenants on the same machine. The env-side rules in [`doca-setup CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy`](../doca-setup/CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy) bind every debug session; no debug action overrides them. If the user *must* change global state to reproduce a symptom, document the change, capture the before/after, and revert as soon as the reproduction is complete.

8. **Public forum posts must respect the public-sources contract.** The DOCA Developer Forum (<https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/c/infrastructure/doca/370>) is the right escalation channel when the bundle's debug ladder runs out. When helping the user file a forum post, ensure the post does not include internal NVIDIA hostnames, internal package mirror URLs, internal build numbers, or anything that contradicts ground rule #1 in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). Customer-facing public artifacts only.
