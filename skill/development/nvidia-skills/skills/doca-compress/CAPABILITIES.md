# DOCA Compress capabilities, version overlay, errors, observability, safety

**Where to start:** Pick the H2 anchor that matches your question
(capabilities / version / errors / observability / safety) and
read that section end-to-end. The tables in each section are the
load-bearing content; the prose around them is interpretation.

version-handling rules that this skill layers a Compress overlay
on top of, see [`doca-version`](../../doca-version/SKILL.md).

## Pattern overview

Every DOCA Compress question this skill teaches resolves into one
of FIVE patterns. The patterns are CLASSES — they apply across
every Compress release and every BlueField / ConnectX device the
accelerator runs on.

| Pattern | When it applies (class shape) | Where the substance lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Decide whether to offload | Compare the per-call setup cost of doca-compress against a CPU compressor (zlib / zstd) on the same input; choose offload only when the input is bulk (rule of thumb: ≥ a few KiB), repeated, or already pinned in `doca_mmap` memory | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) path-selection table + [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy) *"when NOT to use doca-compress"* bullets |
| 2. Pick the task type(s) to enable | Compress task (`doca_compress_task_compress_deflate`) for outbound encoding; decompress task (`doca_compress_task_decompress_deflate`) for inbound decoding. Either is a valid standalone shape — a decompress-only consumer does NOT need to enable the compress task | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) compress-vs-decompress table + [TASKS.md ## modify](TASKS.md#modify) |
| 3. Discover capabilities | Query `doca_compress_cap_task_*_is_supported` and `_get_max_buf_size` per task type, against the active `doca_devinfo` BEFORE assuming the task is available or sizing buffers | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) capability-query rule + [TASKS.md ## configure](TASKS.md#configure) step 2 |
| 4. Honor source / destination permissions | Source mmap = `DOCA_ACCESS_FLAG_LOCAL_READ_ONLY` at minimum; destination mmap = `DOCA_ACCESS_FLAG_LOCAL_READ_WRITE`; both must be set BEFORE the first task submission | [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy) permission matrix + [TASKS.md ## test](TASKS.md#test) |
| 5. Diagnose a Compress error | Map symptom (`DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE`, `_INVALID_VALUE`, `_NOT_SUPPORTED`, `_NOT_PERMITTED`, `_AGAIN`, `_DRIVER`) to root cause — lifecycle, buffer sizing, task support, permission, queue pressure, or driver layer — without leaving the Compress layer prematurely | [`## Error taxonomy`](#error-taxonomy) + [TASKS.md ## debug](TASKS.md#debug) |

Two cross-cutting rules that apply to *every* pattern above:

- **Discover the version-installed surface, do not assume.** Every
  pattern above gates on `pkg-config --modversion doca-compress`
  and on the `doca_compress_cap_*` capability queries against the
  active `doca_devinfo`. Quoting a per-task max buffer size, or
  asserting either task type is universally available, without
  checking, is the most common hallucination failure mode.
- **Validate against a round-trip BEFORE bulk.** The cheapest way
  to confirm the configured Compress context produces a correct
  encoding is to compress a small fixed input and decompress the
  output on the accelerator (or against a published CPU encoder
  like `zlib`), compare to the original byte-for-byte, before
  submitting any bulk user data. For decompression-only consumers,
  the equivalent smoke is to decompress a small fixture produced
  by a published CPU encoder.

## Capabilities and modes

DOCA Compress is a **DOCA Core Context**. Every `doca_compress`
instance follows the universal `cfg-create → cfg-set-* → init →
start → use → stop → destroy` lifecycle (see
[`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](../../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)).
On top of that lifecycle, DOCA Compress layers its own task model:
DEFLATE encode and DEFLATE / LZ4 decode modes, each independently
capability-gated.

**The task types.** The agent must call the matching support,
maximum-buffer-size, and (for LZ4) maximum-buffer-list-length
queries before assuming a mode is available or sizing its input.

| Task type | Class shape | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `doca_compress_task_compress_deflate` | Take one source `doca_buf` (raw input) → produce one destination `doca_buf` (DEFLATE-encoded output) | DEFLATE is the most common compression algorithm (the same algorithm used by zlib and gzip). Asynchronous; completion arrives via `doca_pe_progress`. Source must be `≤ doca_compress_cap_task_compress_deflate_get_max_buf_size(devinfo)`; destination must be sized for the worst-case compressed output (a poorly-compressible input can produce slightly more bytes than the input). |
| `doca_compress_task_decompress_deflate` | Take one source `doca_buf` (DEFLATE-encoded input) → produce one destination `doca_buf` (decoded output) | Decompresses DEFLATE-encoded payloads. **Valid as a standalone shape** — a consumer that only decompresses inbound network data does NOT have to enable the compress task. Asynchronous; completion arrives via `doca_pe_progress`. Source must be `≤ doca_compress_cap_task_decompress_deflate_get_max_buf_size(devinfo)`; destination must be sized for the worst-case decompressed output the input could expand to. |
| `doca_compress_task_decompress_lz4_stream` | Take LZ4 stream-format input and produce decoded output | Decode-only; independently gated by its matching support, maximum-buffer-size, and maximum-buffer-list-length queries. |
| `doca_compress_task_decompress_lz4_block` | Take LZ4 block-format input and produce decoded output | Decode-only; independently gated from LZ4 stream and DEFLATE by its matching support, maximum-buffer-size, and maximum-buffer-list-length queries. |

**Path selection — compress vs decompress, or both.** Both task
types can coexist on the same context; enable at least one before
`doca_ctx_start()`. Enabling both is appropriate when the user is
running a round-trip (compress on the producer side, decompress on
the consumer side, same process or same machine); enabling only
one is the right shape for a one-direction pipeline.

| Path | What it is | Right shape for | Wrong shape for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compress-only | Enable `doca_compress_task_compress_deflate`, leave decompress disabled | A producer / writer that emits DEFLATE-encoded output (e.g. compress-before-write storage daemon, compress-before-network sender, deduplication preprocessing) | A consumer that ONLY decodes inbound DEFLATE — enable the decompress task instead |
| Decompress-only | Enable `doca_compress_task_decompress_deflate`, leave compress disabled | A consumer / reader that decodes inbound DEFLATE-encoded data (e.g. decompress-on-read storage daemon, decompress-on-network receiver) — fully valid standalone shape | A producer that ONLY encodes outbound payloads — enable the compress task instead |
| Both | Enable both tasks on the same context | A round-trip flow (compress on one side, decompress on the other, same process) or a content-addressing pipeline that both encodes new blobs and decodes existing ones | Single-direction pipelines — keep the unused task disabled to keep the configuration surface small |

**Path-selection — when to use DOCA Compress at all.** The
agent's rule:

- **Use doca-compress when** the input is bulk (rule of thumb:
  ≥ a few KiB, with the canonical fit being inputs of file-size
  scale — typically ≥ 4 KiB and upwards), the throughput
  requirement is high enough that freeing the CPU for other work
  is valuable, or the input is already pinned in `doca_mmap`
  memory because another DOCA library produced it. File
  compression, deduplication preprocessing, and content-addressed
  storage prep are the canonical fits.
- **Do NOT use doca-compress when** the input is tiny one-shot
  (e.g. 64-byte buffers — the per-call DMA-to-accelerator setup
  cost dominates; CPU compression with zlib / zstd is faster);
  when the user needs **outbound** compression in an algorithm
  other than DEFLATE (use a CPU compression library — DOCA
  Compress exposes ONLY DEFLATE on the compress / encode side).
  However, DOCA Compress **does** support **LZ4 decompress** on
  the inbound / decode side, via two distinct task families
  (`doca_compress_task_decompress_lz4_stream` and
  `doca_compress_task_decompress_lz4_block`), each with its own
  `_cap_task_decompress_lz4_{stream,block}_is_supported(devinfo)`
  + `_get_max_buf_size` + `_get_max_buf_list_len` queries (and
  corresponding shipped samples under
  `/opt/mellanox/doca/samples/doca_compress/`). Do NOT blanket-
  refuse LZ4 — only outbound LZ4 encode is out of scope. The
  rule of thumb is: DEFLATE both directions; LZ4 decompress
  only; everything else (zstd / Snappy / brotli / …) → CPU.
  When the user only wants to move bytes without encoding them,
  use [`doca-dma`](../doca-dma/SKILL.md) — pure mmap-to-mmap copy
  is DMA's job, not Compress's.

**The size-threshold the cap query does NOT report.** The
capability queries below report the per-task **maximum** input
size; they do NOT report the per-task **minimum** below which CPU
compression beats accelerator submission. That floor is
device-dependent and workload-dependent, and the agent must own
it as a path-selection rule rather than read it from the device.
A small smoke benchmark on representative inputs (CPU `zlib`
elapsed vs doca-compress elapsed end-to-end including
submit + progress + completion drain) is the only authoritative
answer for *"is offload worth it for inputs of size N"* on a
given host.

**Capability discovery — the only rule.** Before enabling either
task or sizing any buffer, call the matching `doca_compress_cap_*`
query against the active `doca_devinfo`:

| Capability | Query | Why the agent must ask |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compress-deflate task supported | `doca_compress_cap_task_compress_deflate_is_supported(devinfo)` | The compress task is not on every device; some accelerators ship decompress-only. If false, the device cannot encode in hardware; the user must fall back to CPU compression or pick a different device. |
| Decompress-deflate task supported | `doca_compress_cap_task_decompress_deflate_is_supported(devinfo)` | Symmetric to the above. Independent of the compress query; agent must not assume support for one implies the other. |
| Decompress-lz4-stream task supported | `doca_compress_cap_task_decompress_lz4_stream_is_supported(devinfo)` | The hardware **does** decompress LZ4 stream-format payloads. Independent of the DEFLATE queries. The bundle previously refused this; the real surface is shipped. |
| Decompress-lz4-block task supported | `doca_compress_cap_task_decompress_lz4_block_is_supported(devinfo)` | The hardware also decompresses LZ4 block-format payloads. Independent of the LZ4-stream query and the DEFLATE queries. |
| Maximum source size, compress | `doca_compress_cap_task_compress_deflate_get_max_buf_size(devinfo)` | Device-bound ceiling on raw input size per compress submission. Inputs larger than this must be fragmented at the application layer; the library does not auto-chunk. |
| Maximum source size, decompress | `doca_compress_cap_task_decompress_deflate_get_max_buf_size(devinfo)`, `doca_compress_cap_task_decompress_lz4_stream_get_max_buf_size(devinfo)`, `doca_compress_cap_task_decompress_lz4_block_get_max_buf_size(devinfo)` (per algorithm) | Device-bound ceiling on compressed input size per decompress submission. The decompressed output can be substantially larger than this; the destination buffer sizing is the application's responsibility. |

**Configuration shape.** *Mandatory* configurations before
`doca_ctx_start()`: enable at least one source-verified task
configuration matching the selected DEFLATE encode, DEFLATE decode,
LZ4 stream decode, or LZ4 block decode mode, and set the matching
mmap permissions on both source and destination buffers per the
matrix in [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy). *Optional*
configurations (queue sizing, per-task `set_conf` callback
budget) use the standard DOCA Core `set_*` family with defaults
coming from the library; query the active capability values via
`doca_compress_cap_*`.

## Version compatibility

For the canonical DOCA version-detection chain, the four-way match
rule, NGC container semantics, and the headers-win-over-docs rule,
see [`doca-version`](../../doca-version/SKILL.md). The body lives
there; this skill does not duplicate it.

**The Compress-specific overlay** is:

- **Per-task support is device-bound, not version-bound.** The
  agent must not infer *"DOCA version X includes the compress
  task and the decompress task"* from release notes alone; the
  runtime authority is
  `doca_compress_cap_task_compress_deflate_is_supported(devinfo)`
  and `_decompress_deflate_is_supported(devinfo)` against the
  active device. Per the cross-cutting cap-query rule in
  [`doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](../../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#observability),
  the cap query is the runtime authority — never quote either
  task as available from agent memory.
- **`doca-compress.pc` plus `doca-common.pc` must both match
  `doca_caps --version`** at the four-way-match check (per
  [`doca-version CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](../../doca-version/CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility)).
  A common partial-install pattern on hosts where the Compress
  package was installed separately from the rest of DOCA is that
  `doca-compress.pc` reports release *X* while `doca-common.pc`
  reports release *Y*; route to
  [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug)
  layer 2 before any Compress-layer diagnosis.
- **Per-task max buffer size is device-bound, not version-bound.**
  The `_get_max_buf_size` queries are the runtime authority; the
  matching `version-matrix.json` row records the *promise*. If
  the two disagree, the cap-query value wins, per the
  headers-win-over-docs rule in
  [`doca-version`](../../doca-version/SKILL.md).

## Error taxonomy

Compress-specific overlays on the cross-library `DOCA_ERROR_*`
taxonomy. The cross-library taxonomy itself lives in
[`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](../../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy);
the rows below are the *Compress surface* meaning that the agent
must disambiguate before falling back to the cross-library
response.

| Error | Compress context where it shows up | Compress-specific cause |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE` | Any call after `doca_ctx_stop()` or before `doca_ctx_start()`; destroying the source or destination `doca_mmap` before `doca_ctx_destroy()` | Lifecycle violation. Walk the call sequence against the lifecycle in [`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](../../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes); the most common case is releasing a source / destination mmap underneath a still-running context. |
| `DOCA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE` | `doca_compress_task_compress_deflate_alloc_init`; `doca_compress_task_decompress_deflate_alloc_init`; submit time | The source buffer is larger than the matching `_get_max_buf_size` for the task type, OR the destination buffer is too small for the worst-case output (compress: input that does not compress well can produce slightly more bytes than the input; decompress: output can be substantially larger than the compressed input). Re-run the matching cap query, then resize. |
| `DOCA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` | `doca_compress_task_*_set_conf`; first submit | The requested task type is not available on this device's accelerator. Re-run the matching `doca_compress_cap_task_*_is_supported(devinfo)` query; if false, that is the answer — the user's device cannot offload this task type. Fall back to CPU compression or pick a different device. |
| `DOCA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED` | First task submission | The source mmap does not have `DOCA_ACCESS_FLAG_LOCAL_READ_ONLY` (or a stronger flag that supersedes it), OR the destination mmap is missing `DOCA_ACCESS_FLAG_LOCAL_READ_WRITE`. Re-check the matrix in [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy). |
| `DOCA_ERROR_AGAIN` | `doca_task_submit` on either Compress task type | The task queue is full. This is *not* a hardware error; the program must drain completions via `doca_pe_progress()` before re-submitting. Same as the cross-library *"would-block, retry after progress"* pattern. |
| `DOCA_ERROR_DRIVER` | Any submit / completion call | The layer below DOCA reported failure (driver / firmware / accelerator). Capture state and route to env-class debug ([`doca-setup ## debug`](../../doca-setup/TASKS.md#debug)) — the layer below DOCA is the suspect, not the Compress program. |

The agent's rule: **never recommend a retry loop on `DOCA_ERROR_*`
without first identifying which of the rows above is the cause**.
`_AGAIN` is the only one that wants a retry (after
`doca_pe_progress()`); the others want investigation, not retry.

## Observability

DOCA Compress observability is **event-driven, not poll-driven**.
Every submitted task produces a completion event on the DOCA Core
progress engine; there are no Compress-specific counters the way
Flow has per-pipe counters.

Three primary signals the agent should reach for:

1. **Task completion events on the PE.** Every submitted Compress
   task (compress or decompress) produces a completion event when
   it finishes (or errors). The completion carries the
   `doca_error_t` if it failed AND the actual output size
   produced; the agent must inspect the per-task completion, not
   the `doca_task_submit()` return value alone. *Submitted but no
   completion* is almost always a missed `doca_pe_progress()`
   call in the user's main loop.
2. **Capability snapshot at configure time.** The output of every
   `doca_compress_cap_*` query is a snapshot of *what the
   device's accelerator said was possible* before any task was
   submitted. Save it as the baseline; if a task later returns
   `DOCA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` or `DOCA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE` the
   diff against this snapshot is the bug.
3. **Round-trip validation on a known input.** The cheapest
   correctness signal is to compress a small fixed input and
   decompress the output (either on the accelerator if both tasks
   are enabled, or against a published CPU decoder like `zlib`)
   and compare to the original byte-for-byte. If the round-trip
   does not match, the configuration is wrong; do not move on to
   bulk input. For decompression-only consumers, the equivalent
   smoke is decompressing a small DEFLATE blob produced by a
   published CPU encoder and comparing to the original input.

For cross-cutting observability primitives (`--sdk-log-level`,
the `doca-<lib>-trace` build flavor, the `DOCA_LOG_LEVEL` env
var) see
[`doca-debug CAPABILITIES.md ## Observability`](../../doca-debug/CAPABILITIES.md#observability).
For the install-tree observability (logger names, package
layout) defer to
[`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).

## Safety policy

> **Overlay on the bundle-wide hardware-safety meta-policy.** The rules below are this skill's per-artifact overlay on the cross-cutting rules in [`doca-hardware-safety` CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy](../../doca-hardware-safety/CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy) (specifically [### Per-artifact overlay pattern](../../doca-hardware-safety/CAPABILITIES.md#per-artifact-overlay-pattern)). When the two layers disagree, the stricter wins; when either layer says STOP, the agent stops.

DOCA Compress's safety surface is **buffer-permission discipline
plus path-selection discipline**. The library reads from a source
buffer and writes encoded (or decoded) output into a destination
buffer; an incorrect permission flag on either side surfaces as a
submit-time error rather than silent corruption — but only when
the matrix is correct. The agent's job is to verify both
permission and the *should I use the accelerator at all*
question before any submission.

The **permission matrix** the agent must walk for any new
Compress setup:

| Buffer | Minimum mmap permission | Class shape | Common over-broad mistake |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source (input) | `DOCA_ACCESS_FLAG_LOCAL_READ_ONLY` | The accelerator only needs to read the input; granting write is unnecessary and a small attack-surface widening | Granting `DOCA_ACCESS_FLAG_LOCAL_READ_WRITE` "to keep things simple" — works, but the read-only flag is the safe minimum |
| Destination (output) | `DOCA_ACCESS_FLAG_LOCAL_READ_WRITE` | The accelerator writes the encoded / decoded output; the application reads it back | Reusing the source `doca_mmap` as the destination — fails at submit if the mmap is read-only; if both buffers share an mmap, the mmap must be read-write |

**Path-selection — when NOT to use doca-compress.** Equally
important:

- **Tiny one-shot inputs.** A single 64-byte compress on the CPU
  is faster than the DMA-to-accelerator setup. The agent should
  recommend doca-compress only when the input is bulk (rule of
  thumb: ≥ a few KiB, typically ≥ 4 KiB and upwards) *or*
  repeated, *or* the input is already pinned in `doca_mmap`
  memory because another DOCA library produced it.
- **Non-DEFLATE / non-LZ4 algorithm.** The public task names
  commit doca-compress to DEFLATE (the same algorithm
  underlying zlib and gzip) on the **encode** side
  (`doca_compress_task_compress_deflate`) and to DEFLATE +
  **LZ4 stream / LZ4 block** on the **decode** side
  (`doca_compress_task_decompress_deflate`,
  `doca_compress_task_decompress_lz4_stream`,
  `doca_compress_task_decompress_lz4_block`). If the user needs a
  different algorithm (zstd, Snappy, brotli, …, or LZ4 on the
  **encode** side), the answer is to use a CPU
  library that implements it, not to invent a DOCA workaround.
- **Pure copy, no compression.** If the user only wants to move
  bytes between two `doca_mmap` regions without encoding them,
  [`doca-dma`](../doca-dma/SKILL.md) is the right library — its
  memcpy task is purpose-built for that pattern. Layering
  doca-compress on top wastes accelerator cycles on encoding
  output the user does not want.

**The mmap must stay valid until the Compress context is
destroyed.** Destroying either the source or destination mmap
before `doca_ctx_destroy()` is a use-after-free on the library's
bookkeeping; symptoms include `DOCA_ERROR_BAD_STATE` from
subsequent calls and undefined behavior on outstanding tasks.

**Validate against a round-trip BEFORE bulk submission.** A
single round-trip smoke (compress one short input and decompress
the output, or decompress a single small published DEFLATE
fixture) catches algorithm mis-selection, endian assumptions, and
buffer-sizing bugs before they corrupt a multi-GiB result.

## Deferred topic boundaries

This skill scopes itself to the DOCA Compress library. Adjacent
topics the agent will get asked but should route elsewhere:

- **General compression algorithm background** (entropy coding,
  why DEFLATE produces sub-optimal ratios on already-compressed
  inputs, when zstd is preferred to gzip, compression-level
  trade-offs in CPU libraries) — outside this skill. Route to
  upstream zlib / DEFLATE specification documentation; this
  skill assumes the user already knows they want DEFLATE and is
  asking *how to express it through the DOCA Compress API*.
- **DOCA Core context and progress engine internals** — owned by
  [`doca-programming-guide`](../../doca-programming-guide/SKILL.md).
  This skill *uses* the Core context lifecycle; it does not
  redefine it.
- **Cross-cutting `DOCA_ERROR_*` taxonomy** — owned by
  [`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](../../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy).
  This skill adds the Compress overlay, not the taxonomy itself.
- **Pure mmap-to-mmap copies** — owned by
  [`doca-dma`](../doca-dma/SKILL.md). When the user wants bytes
  moved without encoding, DMA is the answer; Compress is not.
- **Other DOCA accelerator libraries (DOCA SHA, DOCA AES-GCM,
  DOCA Erasure Coding, …)** — separate libraries with their own
  skills (when they ship). Path-selection guidance in
  [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) names
  them; the deep per-library substance lives in the matching
  skill.
- **Cross-library `doca_caps` invocation patterns** — owned by
  the cross-library [`doca-caps`](../../tools/doca-caps/SKILL.md)
  tool skill. This skill references the *Compress capability
  query family* (`doca_compress_cap_*`), which is per-library;
  the *cross-library capability snapshot tool* (`doca_caps
  --list-devs`) is a separate surface.
