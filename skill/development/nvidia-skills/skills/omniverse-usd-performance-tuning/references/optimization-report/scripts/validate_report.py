"""Validate a USD Performance Tuning report against optimization-report.schema.json.

Deterministic local validation with no third-party runtime dependencies. The
agent (or CI) should run this before treating a report as final, so an
out-of-enum verdict, a missing required field, or an unexpected array-item key
is caught instead of shipping a schema-invalid report.

Implements the JSON Schema draft-07 subset this schema uses: type (including
type unions like ["string", "null"]), enum, required, properties,
additionalProperties=false, items, minimum, and maximum.

Phase-4 target coverage gate
----------------------------
Schema validation alone cannot catch a Phase-4 target that was never enumerated
in the report (the failure mode where an assembly_root remainder is silently
left un-optimized). A report's ``target_coverage.complete`` flag is self-attested
by the report author, so the gate reconciles ``target_coverage`` against the
upstream apply-restructure manifest(s): the report must cover the UNION of every
iteration's ``phase4_targets[]``, every disposition must be resolved, and
``skipped_zero_meshes`` is accepted only when the manifest's authoritative
``mesh_count`` for that target is 0.

Reconciliation is fail-closed, not opt-in: when any coverage entry has a
restructure role (assembly_root | prototype | shared_layer | loadable_subasset)
a manifest is REQUIRED. Manifests are taken from ``--manifest`` and/or the
report's own ``target_coverage.source_manifests[]`` (auto-loaded relative to the
report), so a restructure report cannot pass merely because the operator forgot
the flag. Monolith/diagnosis runs (no restructure roles) stay manifest-free.

Footprint gate (repack-normalization)
-------------------------------------
When the optional ``footprint`` block is present, the gate checks the
raw -> repack_normalized -> optimized arithmetic is consistent and fails closed
on a repack-as-optimization claim: a raw->optimized saving that is almost
entirely the free crate re-encode (structural shrink ~0 off the
repack-normalized baseline) cannot be presented as the optimization win.

Preservation gate (axis-A silent-loss)
--------------------------------------
When the optional ``preservation`` block is present, the gate checks its shape
matches what the run-scoring oracle consumes:
integer ``rendered_mesh_count`` / ``dangling`` and boolean
``distinct_geometry_bytes_preserved`` / ``bounds_preserved``. Whether those
values actually pass (count unchanged, bounds/bytes preserved, dangling 0) is
scored against the asset's oracle, not here.

Descent-convergence gate (premature-merge / premature-decimate)
---------------------------------------------------------------
A run that did hierarchy dedup / instancing must not run a Phase-4 geometry op
(decimation, within-prototype merge, primitive-fit, quantization, topology edit)
before the bounded recursive de-duplication descent has CONVERGED. The skill
documents this descent and its convergence as prose plus the manifest fields
``frontier.descent_converged`` / ``frontier.final_rescan_new_groups_above_floor``,
but nothing enforced it. This gate fails closed, keyed on the output
report/manifest (so a hand-authored rewrite is gated the same as a native
``deduplicateHierarchies`` run), unless convergence is recorded in the manifest
frontier block or the report ``structural_summary`` mirror keys
(``frontier_descent_converged`` + ``frontier_final_rescan_new_groups_above_floor``
== 0), or an explicit ``frontier.convergence_waived_by_user`` is set. It also
rejects the ``descent_converged == true`` with residue-remaining contradiction.

Usage:
    python3 validate_report.py <report.json> [--schema <schema.json>] \\
        [--manifest <apply-restructure-manifest.json> ...]
Exit code 0 when the report conforms and the coverage gate passes, 1 otherwise.

    the manifest ``frontier`` block OR the report ``structural_summary`` mirror must

    The gate keys on THIS-RUN dedup signals: an unambiguous dedup/instancing op
    marker, an apply-restructure manifest, an ``instance_count`` increase, a
