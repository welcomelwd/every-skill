# apply-restructure

## When to Use

Use this reference to execute the plan from restructure-decision and usd-edit-target-planner. Orchestrates USD reference rewriting for Phase 2f (monolithic -> prototypes) and Phase 5 (parent assemblies -> optimized children + stage-level cleanup). Two cognate modes under one skill since both reduce to 'write USD files + rewrite references'.

## Instructions

See `references/_shared/standard-instructions.md`.

## Output Format

See `references/_shared/standard-output-format.md`.

> **Invocation.** Tool of `restructure-decision` (Phase 2e gate, mode=`restructure`) and the `optimize-loop` (mode=`ref_remap`, after Phase 4 mesh ops produce optimized sub-assets). In Codex / generic shell agents, invoke by name. In Claude Code, also available as `/apply-restructure`.
>
> **Python invocation.** Examples below use `python3` (POSIX) and `py -3` (Windows PowerShell) for the cross-platform helper snippets. Body USD work uses the runtime chosen in Phase 0: when Kit is selected, run pxr/Sdf code under the Kit-bundled interpreter or `omni.kit.app`; when standalone is selected, the project-managed `usdpy` (or any compatible Pixar USD Python install).

## Purpose

Orchestrate USD reference rewriting in two cognate use cases that both reduce to "write USD files + rewrite references":

- **`mode=restructure`** (Phase 2f, after `restructure-decision` returns `extract-as-assets` or `decompose-for-selective-loading`): materialize the asset boundaries identified by `usd-structure-assessment` §2.5 and the dedupe candidates from `usd-hierarchy-dedupe-candidates`. Hierarchy dedupe is driven **per descent region** by the native `deduplicateHierarchies` op: the identity-first frontier (`usd-hierarchy-dedupe-candidates/scripts/select_frontier.py`) selects the `paths` and a small per-region `maxDepth`, the per-level driver invokes `deduplicateHierarchies(paths=[node], maxDepth=<small>)` on each node and recurses, and `apply-restructure` owns the identity gate, writes the shared prototypes / rewrites duplicate sites as `instanceable=true` references, emits the restructure-role manifest, then validates the new assembly root. Never drive it with a single stage-wide `maxDepth`. The hand-authored `Sdf` path stays permitted for what the native op does not cover (external-prototype materialization into payload files, and material-network closure at a prototype boundary). Execution detail: `references/restructure-mode.md`.
  - **Bounded recursive descent.** Restructure is a bounded *descent*, not one cut: after extracting assemblies, the workflow re-runs boundary inference (§2.5) on each extracted asset to find component, then subcomponent boundaries, to a bounded depth (the stopping rule in `workflow.md` Phase 2g). Tag each `phase4_targets[]` entry with its target-tree tags — `level` (assembly/component/subcomponent = USD `kind`), `importance` / `articulated`, and `archetype` — per the manifest schema; Phase 4 reads them to gate the op chain and per-target tolerance. **Share, don't scatter:** every externalized node MUST be a shared prototype with `instanceable=true` references; N unshared per-node payloads are not the optimization win (the Phase-6 gate fails closed on a repack or unshared split). Articulated assets instance at rigid-body/link level, never whole-asset.
- **`mode=ref_remap`** (Phase 5, after Phase 4 mesh ops): given a map of `original_path -> optimized_path` for each sub-asset Phase 4 produced, compute the parent-assembly impact set, copy each parent to a new path, rewrite its references to point at the optimized children, then run stage-level cleanup ops.

Both modes share the same primitives (write USD, rewrite refs) so they live in one skill body.

## Prerequisites

- A USD asset path that opens cleanly under the active runtime (Phase 0 chosen).
- A writable `output_dir` distinct from the input stage's directory (no in-place overwrites by default).
- USD Python access (`pxr.Usd`, `pxr.Sdf`, and `pxr.UsdUtils`) from the active runtime. Usd Optimize (with `deduplicateHierarchies` in `operationsAvailable`) is the per-region authoring primitive for the internal instanceable-reference collapse; it is not required for the hand-authored `Sdf` paths (external-prototype materialization, material-network closure) that cover what the op does not.
- For `mode=restructure`: a `restructure_plan` packet from `restructure-decision` (boundary cut points + optional dedupe candidates).
- For `mode=ref_remap`: an `optimized_targets` map (every `original_path` actually appears as a reference in the input stage; every `optimized_path` exists and opens cleanly).

## Pre-flight Checklist

Before executing restructure writes, re-read and confirm:

- [ ] `references/restructure-mode.md` § Dedupe Plan — per-region native-op driver,
  reference patching, prototype extraction rules, and material-network closure.
- [ ] User has explicitly approved the restructure plan from Phase 2e.
- [ ] Backup / non-destructive output path — restructure writes new layers,
  never overwrites the original stage in-place.
- [ ] `setup-preflight.json` runtime context — confirm USD Python environment
  is available for authoring.
- [ ] After restructure: run scoped re-validation to confirm no composition
  breaks.

## Limitations

- Cannot guarantee semantic identity for restructured stages - downstream visual or numerical comparison is the user's responsibility.
- Display-name-only grouping is not allowed for hierarchy dedupe. Candidate identity must come from `usd-hierarchy-dedupe-candidates` hashes and any accepted review findings.
- Deeply nested cyclic reference graphs are out of scope. The skill detects the cycle, flags it, and asks for a manual restructure plan rather than guessing.
- Stage-level cleanup (mode=`ref_remap` Step 4) is conservative: only lossless ops by default; bounded-loss residual ops require explicit user confirmation.

## Troubleshooting

- If the input plan from `restructure-decision` references prim paths that do not exist on the stage, return an error that names the missing paths and ask the user to refresh the SA report.
- If the hierarchy rewrite would collapse unrelated assemblies or drop local child overrides, stop and refresh the candidate report with stricter hash settings. See `references/restructure-mode.md` § Dedupe Plan and `skills/omniverse-usd-performance-tuning/references/usd-structure-assessment/references/instancing-readiness/references/instancing-tradeoffs.md` "Merge safety".
- If a parent-assembly copy fails reference rewriting (e.g. the original reference uses a relative path that resolves differently in the new location), capture the resolver context and surface to the user before continuing.
- If minimum USD validation fails on a written output, do NOT delete it; report the failure and let the user inspect the bad file.

```

The strict contract for this file is `scripts/apply-restructure-manifest.schema.json`.
Every `phase4_targets[]` entry MUST carry a top-level `mesh_count` (integer >= 0):
the authoritative default-predicate count
(`len([p for p in Usd.PrimRange.Stage(stage, Usd.PrimDefaultPredicate) if p.IsA(UsdGeom.Mesh)])`)
measured with the target opened standalone, matching the Postcondition below.
`weight_hints.mesh_count` remains an optional, non-authoritative batching estimate.
The downstream Phase-4 completion gate (`optimization-report/scripts/validate_report.py
--manifest`) reconciles the final report's `target_coverage` against the UNION of
every iteration's `phase4_targets[]` and accepts a `skipped_zero_meshes` disposition
only when this `mesh_count` is `0`, so a retained-mesh target cannot be silently dropped.

## Preconditions

- `input_stage` opens cleanly (use `validate-usd-minimum` to confirm before starting).
- `output_dir` exists and is writable; reject if it equals the input stage's directory.
- For `mode=restructure`: `restructure-decision` returned `extract-as-assets` or `decompose-for-selective-loading`; `restructure_plan` is well-formed.
- For `mode=ref_remap`: every `optimized_targets` entry verified - both ends exist and open.

## Postconditions

- `new_assembly_root` opens cleanly and resolves all references (no unresolved asset paths).
- For `mode=restructure`: scenegraph instancing where the original had `instanceable=true` is preserved or improved.
- For `mode=ref_remap`: the new assembly root has the same composition shape as the input, but its reference targets are the optimized children.
- The manifest is emitted to `<output_dir>/apply-restructure-manifest.json` regardless of mode.
- For `mode=restructure`: every written prototype, shared layer, or loadable
  sub-asset that should receive Phase 4 mesh optimization appears in
  `phase4_targets[]`. Do not make downstream agents infer Phase 4 targets by
  scanning output folders or assuming every target lives under `prototypes/`.
- For `mode=restructure`: every payload, prototype, or loadable sub-asset in
  `phase4_targets[]` has Def-spec ancestors from root to mesh when opened
  standalone. Over-spec ancestors silently block SO default-predicate
  traversal (see `restructure-mode.md` §"Authoring Requirements"). Verify
  with a default-predicate mesh count > 0 before emitting the manifest entry.
- For `mode=restructure`: every extracted file has `defaultPrim` set to the
  root prim of the extracted sub-hierarchy. Validate with
  `Usd.Stage.Open(path).GetDefaultPrim().IsValid()`.
- For `mode=restructure`: **residual-mesh postcondition (fail loud).** With the
  USD stage still open, measure the assembly root's default-predicate mesh count
  after extraction and record it under the manifest's `assembly_root`
  (`{ "path": <new_assembly_root>, "mesh_count": <count> }`). When that count is
  `> 0`, the manifest MUST also include the same root in `phase4_targets[]` with
  `target_class: "assembly_root"` and the identical authoritative `mesh_count`.
  **Do not write a restructure manifest that records residual assembly-root
  meshes without that `phase4_targets[]` entry — error out instead.** This check
  lives here because only apply-restructure has the stage open to count residual
  meshes; the report-time gate (`optimization-report/scripts/validate_report.py`)
  only sees report↔manifest and cannot detect the residual itself. The manifest's
  internal consistency is re-asserted by `validate_manifest_structure()` (in
  `optimization-report/scripts/validate_report.py`): `assembly_root.mesh_count > 0`
  with no matching `assembly_root` Phase-4 target fails. Downstream Phase 4 must
  process that entry through the per-target mesh op chain for its retained meshes;
  it is not limited to final stage-level cleanup operations.

## Workflow - mode=restructure (Phase 2f)

Use this when `restructure-decision` returns `extract-as-assets` for a monolithic stage
that should become references-to-prototypes. Follow
`references/restructure-mode.md` for internal-reference scanning, boundary
materialization, hierarchy-dedupe integration, authoring gotchas, output
validation, and the Datasmith/Revit example shape.

High-level steps:

1. Scan for internal references that escape candidate boundaries.
2. Validate input paths, boundary prim paths, and output directory.
3. Drive the per-region native `deduplicateHierarchies` op per descent node from
   the approved frontier (small per-region `maxDepth`; never one global cut),
   owning the identity gate and manifest.
4. Materialize each accepted boundary, shared layer, loadable sub-asset, or
   dedupe group as USD output.
5. Validate every written output with the runner's minimum-openability check.
6. Emit `<output_dir>/apply-restructure-manifest.json` with `phase4_targets[]`
   for downstream adaptive batching.

---

## Workflow - mode=ref_remap (Phase 5)

Use this after Phase 4 mesh ops produce optimized sub-asset USDs at new paths.
Follow `references/ref-remap-mode.md` for impact-set construction, parent
assembly copying, reference rewriting, stage-level cleanup, instanceability
re-application, and output validation.

High-level steps:

1. Compute the parent-assembly impact set from `optimized_targets`.
2. Stop on cyclic reference graphs.
3. Copy impacted parent layers and rewrite references to optimized children.
4. Pick the new assembly root.
5. Run lossless stage-level cleanup through `usd-optimize-run-operations`.
6. Validate written outputs and emit the manifest.

---

## Rules

- Never overwrite the input stage in place; always write to `output_dir`.
- Always write `.usdc` for data-heavy outputs; `.usda` is acceptable only for top-level assembly roots when human readability matters.
- After writing, validate every new USD with the `usd-validation-runner`
  minimum-openability check before declaring success. If it fails, do NOT
  delete the bad file - surface the failure.
- Generate a manifest entry for every output file, even when `dry_run=false`, so downstream phases (Phase 6 verify, optimization-report) can audit what was written.
- Do not include bounded-loss ops in the default `cleanup` chain (mode=`ref_remap` Step 4). Lossless only; user-overridable.
- If a step fails, do not auto-retry. Surface the failure (path + log + summary) and let the user decide.
