# DOCA container deployment — Tasks

**Where to start:** The order is `configure → build → modify → run →
test → debug`. The `## test` verb is an iterative loop, not a
one-shot pass — see the eval-loop overlay in `## test` below. For
container deployment, `build` and `modify` are about *deployment
configuration* (per-service image selection, pod-spec YAML, mount
contracts, per-service config-file mount), not about compiling
source.

These verbs cover the in-scope cross-cutting deployment workflows
for an external operator deploying one of the four supported
service overlays on the BlueField — Argus, DMS, Firefly, or UROM
service. Flow-Inspector and OS-Inspector are policy-excluded and
must route through
[`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md),
not through this deployment workflow. Every step assumes the
operator has consulted the live public DOCA Container Deployment
Guide and the matching per-service guide (both reachable through
[doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services))
and is using them as the authoritative reference; this file
prescribes the *order* and *what to look up where*, not a
copy-paste runbook.

## configure

Preparing the BlueField target, confirming every precondition the
deployment will rely on, and picking the per-service skill that
owns the overlay BEFORE any pod-spec is written. This is also the
verb where the smoke-before-bulk posture is established up front —
every later verb assumes the operator has read it here.

1. **Confirm the env is healthy first.** This skill expects DOCA
   installed on the BlueField Arm and the BlueField OS image
   shipping kubelet standalone + the documented container runtime.
   If install health is unverified, run
   [`doca-setup ## test`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#test) first.
   If the user has no install yet, route to
   [`doca-setup ## no-install`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install)
   for the public NGC DOCA container path. Confirm the BFB
   version on the BlueField is one the public DOCA Container
   Deployment Guide certifies for the operator's DOCA release.
2. **Pick the per-service skill and load it in parallel.**
   Container deployment is a *cross-cutting* runtime; the
   per-service overlay (config schema, paired workload, "healthy"
   definition) lives in the matching per-service skill. Load both
   skills together:
    - Argus → [`doca-argus`](../services/doca-argus/SKILL.md)
    - DMS → [`doca-dms`](../services/doca-dms/SKILL.md)
    - Firefly → [`doca-firefly`](../services/doca-firefly/SKILL.md)
    - UROM service → [`doca-urom-svc`](../services/doca-urom-svc/SKILL.md)

   Quote the per-service config schema and "healthy" signal from
   the per-service skill; quote the runtime contract (kubelet
   standalone, static-pod manifests directory, pod-spec shape,
   mount contract) from this skill.
3. **Confirm the BlueField preconditions.** Per the precondition
   table in
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes),
   close every precondition the per-service skill flags as
   required BEFORE writing a pod spec:
    - DOCA installed on the BlueField Arm and healthy (per
      [`doca-setup ## test`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#test)).
    - Container runtime + kubelet standalone present and running
      on the BlueField, as documented in the public Container
      Deployment Guide.
    - BFB version compatible with the per-service container tag.
    - **Per-service firmware slot** — does NOT apply to any of the
      four supported service overlays (none of them emulate a
      host-facing PCIe device); see the firmware-slot disclaimer
      in [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes).
      If the operator is deploying an externally-productized
      NVIDIA service that does emulate a PCIe device, that is out
      of scope here per the Non-goals callout above and the
      operator's source of truth is the public NVIDIA docs at
      `docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/`.
    - Image-pull reachability from the BlueField to `nvcr.io`
      (corporate proxy / firewall / air-gap concerns close here
      with the operator's network team).
    - Host-OS permissions to write into the documented static-pod
      manifests directory and to read kubelet's log surface and
      the container runtime's log surface.
4. **Identify the per-service image source.** Per the per-service
   public guide, the container image is published to the NGC
   catalog. The agent MUST route through
   [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services)
   for the current image string + tag for the operator's DOCA
   release; do NOT invent an image name from memory. Wrong image
   string is the most common first-app failure for any DOCA service
   deployment, and is the load-bearing first-app failure for this
   shared runtime.
5. **Plan the per-service config-file mount.** Every DOCA service
   container is configured by a documented config file mounted
   into the container at the path the per-service guide names.
   Plan, in this order: (a) where the config file will live on
   the BlueField filesystem (a host path the kubelet runs as can
   read); (b) what mount path the per-service guide expects
   inside the container; (c) the per-service config field names
   the per-service guide quotes — quote from there, do NOT infer
   from generic Kubernetes / config intuition.
6. **Plan the rollback path.** For any in-bundle service the
   per-service skill flags as HIGH-STAKES (Firefly on a production
   time-sensitive plant; DMS replacing the BlueField's gNMI control
   surface; UROM service driving an in-flight paired host↔DPU
   workload), every deploy on a live BlueField must have: (a) the
   pre-deploy BlueField state captured (PHC state before Firefly;
   gNMI session inventory before DMS; paired-workload checkpoint
   before UROM service); (b) the previous-known-good pod spec (or
   a no-service baseline) ready to re-apply; (c) an out-of-band
   way to reach the BlueField if the deploy disrupts host
   connectivity (BlueField console, redundant management path,
   IPMI to the host); (d) a maintenance window agreed with whoever
   uses the host. For Argus, which has no HIGH-STAKES per-service
   overlay by default, the rollback bar is lower but the "be able to
   revert" rule still applies.
7. **Identify the three version anchors.** Per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility),
   record BOTH the host DOCA install version on the BlueField
   Arm (via
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## configure`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#configure)),
   the BFB version on the BlueField, AND the per-service
   container tag pulled. A mismatch among the three is the silent
   *"the docs say this should work"* trap; align them explicitly.

## build

Container deployment is a service runtime, not a library. There is
no *application* artifact for the operator to build — the per-
service container image ships from the public NGC catalog and the
operator pulls it; clients of any per-service surface (gNMI clients
for DMS and PTP followers for Firefly) are tools
the operator already has.

If the user is asking how to build a **per-service config bundle**
(e.g. a Firefly PTP config, a DMS gNMI endpoint bundle, or an
Argus policy bundle), that
is the per-service skill's `## modify` workflow, not a build. Route
to the matching per-service skill.

If the user is asking how to build a **DOCA application** that
will be deployed by the same kubelet-standalone + pod-spec-drop
pattern — that is, a user-authored container image rather than an
NVIDIA-shipped one — the build is the application's normal DOCA
build (per
[`doca-programming-guide ## build`](../doca-programming-guide/TASKS.md#build))
plus a container build the user owns. The shared runtime contract
in [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
still applies to the *deploy* step; the build step is library-
shaped, not service-shaped.

If the user is asking how to build the **per-service container
itself** from source, that is *not* an external-operator workflow
— the container ships pre-built from NGC and rebuilding it is out
of scope. Route to the per-service public guide via
[doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services).

## modify

Container deployment does not have a "modify a sample program"
workflow analogous to DOCA libraries; there is no shared sample
the user starts from. The deployment-side analog of "modify" is
**adapt the documented pod-spec recipe from the public DOCA
Container Deployment Guide plus the matching per-service guide to
the operator's environment**:

1. **Start from the documented recipe.** Identify, in the public
   DOCA Container Deployment Guide *for the BFB the operator is
   on*, the pod-spec recipe that matches the operator's service.
   If the per-service guide ships its own pod-spec recipe (e.g.
   a Firefly or DMS YAML), use that
   as the per-service overlay on top. Quote both; do not author a
   new pod-spec shape from scratch.
2. **Diff against the operator's environment.** Note the
   substitutions the operator MUST make: the per-service
   container image tag pulled from NGC, the host path that
   holds the per-service config file, the volume-mount points
   the per-service guide names, any per-service envvars /
   security-context the per-service guide quotes, and the
   per-service paired-workload coordinates (PHC device node for
   Firefly, gNMI client endpoint for DMS, paired host↔DPU socket
   for UROM service).
   Capture each substitution explicitly; the substitution list
   is the operator's edit log for the deploy.
3. **Apply minimum-change.** Change only what the operator's
   environment forces. Every additional deviation from the
   documented recipe widens the surface for an unintended
   mount-path / network-policy / image-pull / version failure
   the operator will have to debug later.
4. **Re-validate against the precondition table.** Each
   substitution is a chance to accidentally break a BlueField
   precondition (firmware slot, BFB version, image-pull
   reachability, host-path permission). Walk
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   precondition table after every substitution.
5. **Re-validate against the per-service safety overlay.** Per-
   service skills add their own safety overlays (Firefly's
   PTP-aware-path-required rule, DMS's gNMI-credential rotation
   rule, UROM service's paired-workload-restart-order rule, and
   Argus's policy-rollback rule). The modify step is the right place
   to surface the overlay, not debug time.
6. **Stage the pod spec outside the watched directory.** Write,
   review, and validate the adapted YAML in a staging location that
   kubelet does not watch. `## modify` performs no live manifest
   write. The sole routine deployment write into the documented
   static-pod manifests directory occurs in [`## run`](#run) step 2,
   after the staged file and rollback snapshot are ready. The
   conditional destructive smoke in [`## test`](#test) step 2 is a
   non-routine exception with stricter approval and rollback gates.

The agent's anti-pattern alert: a *"start from a generic
Kubernetes pod-spec template and adapt"* is almost always slower
than starting from the public Container Deployment Guide plus
per-service guide, because the documented BlueField pod-spec
fields and the static-pod manifests directory are not 1:1 with
upstream Kubernetes intuition.

## run

Bringing up the per-service pod, confirming the runtime layer
reaches a healthy state, and confirming the per-service liveness
signal before layering any real workload on top. Every step here
assumes the prerequisites in [`## configure`](#configure) are done.

1. **Confirm the per-service image is pullable from NGC.** Per
   [`## configure`](#configure) step 4, the image string +
   tag comes from the per-service public guide reached through
   [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md);
   the BlueField has reach to `nvcr.io`; the documented image-list
   command on the BlueField container runtime can pull a fresh
   copy of the image and report the digest. A pull failure here
   is a layer-3 symptom in
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
   and must be resolved before the pod-spec is dropped.
2. **Drop the documented pod spec into the static-pod manifests
   directory — the sole routine deployment write.** Per [`## modify`](#modify)
   step 6, the pod-spec YAML was authored and validated outside
   the watched directory from the public Container Deployment
   Guide plus the per-service guide. After capturing the prior
   live manifest (or no-manifest baseline) for rollback, the
   operator performs the workflow's routine deployment write at the
   documented watched path. Adding the file triggers kubelet's
   documented reconcile.
3. **Verify kubelet has scheduled the pod.** Use the BlueField
   container manager's documented status command (or its
   structured-status surface per
   [`doca-structured-tools-contract`](../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md))
   to confirm the pod is in `Running` with no recent restarts.
   A pod stuck in `Pending` is layer 2 of
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy);
   a pod in `ImagePullBackOff` is layer 3; a pod in
   `CrashLoopBackOff` is layer 4. Drop to
   [`## debug`](#debug) BEFORE proceeding if the pod is not
   `Running`.
4. **Read the container's ENTRYPOINT log.** Use the BlueField
   container manager's documented log-stream command for the
   running container. Confirm the per-service guide's documented
   bring-up lines appear and that no documented error / warning
   lines repeat. A "container Running but ENTRYPOINT log shows a
   config-parse error" is the canonical layer-4 (runtime /
   ENTRYPOINT) trap — the pod is "running" in kubelet's view but
   the service inside is not actually serving its purpose.
5. **Verify the per-service liveness signal.** Each per-service
   skill names the documented liveness signal that proves the
   service inside the container is actually ready (event-stream
   output for Argus, gNMI session up + per-RPC counter for DMS,
   ports state + PHC offset for Firefly, or per-operation counter
   for UROM service). Read it now, per the
   matching per-service skill. If the per-service signal is NOT
   healthy, drop to
   [`## debug`](#debug) layer 4 (runtime / ENTRYPOINT) or to
   the per-service skill's debug ladder — not to "restart the
   pod and hope".
6. **Smoke before bulk (next: `## test` step 1).** Before
   driving any per-service workload (real PTP-locked workload for
   Firefly, gNMI traffic for DMS, paired UROM workload for UROM
   service, policy-driven
   monitoring for Argus), walk `## test` step 1 once to confirm
   end-to-end readiness; only then layer the workload on top.

For the runtime version + container-tag cross-checks that
underlie *"my service behaves differently from what the docs
say"*, see
[`doca-version TASKS.md ## run`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#run)
and apply the three-version-anchor overlay from
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility).

## test

Container deployment has no "compile and unit-test" workflow —
testing is operational and end-to-end.

**`## test` is an iterative loop, not a one-shot pass.** Every
mutation (pod-spec field edit, image-tag bump, mount path change,
config-file edit, per-service config knob, BFB upgrade) re-opens
the smoke sweep. Skipping the re-run after a mutation is the
failure mode this loop replaces.

**Iteration identity:** compare the tuple of mutation class, staged
manifest identity, kubelet pod state, container exit signature,
ENTRYPOINT result, and per-service liveness result. Two consecutive
iterations with the same complete tuple are unchanged and trigger
escalation; unchanged is never success.

The eval-loop overlay (rows apply to every DOCA service
deployment, not just one service):

| Step | Why this is a loop, not a step | Where the substance lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 → 4 → 1 | Step 1.3/1.4 (per-service liveness signal and probe) often reveals an as-deployed gap in the per-service config that masquerades as a pod problem; loop back to step 1 | [`## test`](#test) steps 1.3 + 1.4 |
| 2 → ## debug | When the pod does NOT reach `Running`, the deployment is non-functional — escalate to [`## debug`](#debug) immediately, do not run later steps | [`## debug`](#debug) |
| 3 → ## configure → 3 | When the ENTRYPOINT log shows a precondition was not closed (firmware slot, BFB version, image-pull, mount path), loop back to [`## configure`](#configure) step 3 and re-walk the preconditions | [`## configure`](#configure) |
| 1..5 → ## run | Each loop iteration ends with a documented smoke; if all five pass, hand off to live `## run` traffic | [`## run`](#run) |

The agent's rule: every mutation re-opens the sweep. A pod-spec
edit followed by *"it probably still works"* is exactly the
failure mode the iterative loop is here to prevent — and on a
HIGH-STAKES in-bundle service (Firefly on a production plant, DMS
replacing a live gNMI control surface, UROM service driving an
in-flight paired workload) the cost of that failure mode is host
disruption, not just *"weird traffic"*.

1. **End-to-end smoke (the recommended deployment smoke).** With
   the pod scheduled, confirm in this order:
    1. Pod is in `Running` per kubelet's documented status
       surface; restart count stable (NOT in `CrashLoopBackOff`,
       NOT in `ImagePullBackOff`).
    2. Container ENTRYPOINT log shows the per-service config
       parsed cleanly and the documented bring-up lines complete.
    3. The per-service liveness signal (per the matching per-
       service skill) is healthy. This is the load-bearing
       end-to-end proof; "pod Running" alone is NOT the same as
       "service ready".
    4. A trivial liveness probe against the service's documented
       endpoint succeeds (per-service skill names what "trivial"
       means — one event for Argus, one gNMI Get for DMS, one PTP
       frame for Firefly, or one UROM
       operation for UROM service). Only after all four pieces
       pass is the deployment ready for bulk per-service workload.
2. **CONDITIONAL DESTRUCTIVE SMOKE (non-routine) — pod-spec smoke.**
   Confirm the negative case: temporarily
   edit a non-critical pod-spec field that the public Container
   Deployment Guide flags as kubelet-validated (e.g. the
   resource request, the documented label set, the documented
   pod-spec metadata field) and confirm kubelet's status surface
   reports the expected reconcile. A live-manifest mutation smoke is
   allowed only on a target with no active paired workloads and a
   confirmed maintenance window. Before the mutation, all three
   gates are mandatory:
    - [ ] Explicit operator approval is recorded.
    - [ ] A pre-mutation manifest snapshot is saved.
    - [ ] Rollback is tested and verified.

   If any gate is unchecked, SKIP this destructive smoke. Restore
   the correct value immediately afterwards and verify against the
   snapshot. This is the operator's evidence that the deploy
   contract is in fact reconcile-driven on their specific
   BlueField.
3. **Precondition smoke.** Independently of the pod, confirm each
   precondition the per-service skill flags is still satisfied:
   `nvcr.io` is reachable from the BlueField; the per-service
   firmware slot (if any) is still enabled; the BFB version
   matches the Container Deployment Guide; the host path holding
   the per-service config file is still in place. A divergence
   between *"precondition healthy independently"* and *"pod is
   not healthy"* is a layer-4 / layer-5 / layer-6 symptom in
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy);
   convergence is a per-service-config symptom routed to the
   per-service skill.
4. **Capability + deploy snapshot.** Save the *as-deployed*
   answer to: which per-service container tag is running, which
   BFB and host DOCA versions it pairs with, which pod-spec
   YAML was dropped, where the per-service config file lives,
   what `kubelet` reports for the pod, what the container
   ENTRYPOINT log's bring-up looks like, what the per-service
   liveness signal reads. This snapshot is the artifact that
   lets future debug sessions skip rediscovery — and on a
   HIGH-STAKES service it is the rollback baseline.
5. **Multi-pod smoke (only when the service has paired peers).**
   For supported services with paired pods or paired host-side
   workloads (host-side time follower for Firefly, gNMI client
   for DMS, paired host↔DPU
   workload for UROM service), bring the paired peer up after
   this pod and confirm the per-service smoke the per-service
   skill names (host's `chronyc tracking` follows the PHC for
   Firefly, gNMI Get returns documented schema for DMS, or a
   paired UROM operation completes for UROM service). One peer at a
   time; multi-peer bring-up that batches everything together
   makes ingest-failure attribution much harder.

Loop termination: stop iterating once two consecutive iterations
have the same mutation class, staged manifest identity, pod state,
exit signature, ENTRYPOINT result, and liveness result. This
matching evidence across both iterations requires escalation, never
success; the cause
is below the deployment runtime (per-service config, paired peer,
BlueField OS, host). Escalate to the per-service skill's debug
ladder plus
[`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug)
with the captured layer evidence.

## debug

Layered diagnosis. Walk the layers in this order; do not skip
down without clearing the layer above. The eight layers match
[`CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy).

1. **Pod-spec syntax layer (layer 1).** Is the YAML pod-spec
   file even parsing? Symptoms: kubelet's log surface shows a
   parse / schema error; the pod never appears in kubelet's
   status output even though the YAML is in the documented
   static-pod manifests directory. Resolution: re-quote the
   pod-spec shape from the public DOCA Container Deployment
   Guide for the BFB the operator is on; do NOT infer field
   names from generic Kubernetes intuition. A common trap is a
   pod-spec field name that *exists* in upstream Kubernetes but
   is rejected by the kubelet build the BlueField OS image
   ships.
2. **Pod scheduling layer (layer 2).** Pod-spec parses, but the
   pod never reaches `Running`. Symptoms: pod stuck in
   `Pending`; kubelet reports a scheduling refusal. Resolution:
   re-walk the BlueField precondition table in
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)
   (BFB version, host-OS permissions, image-pull reachability;
   none of the four supported service overlays require a firmware
   emulation slot per the firmware-slot disclaimer in
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes));
   confirm the resource requests in the pod spec are within the
   BlueField Arm's budget per the public guide.
3. **Image-pull layer (layer 3).** Pod scheduled but the
   container runtime cannot pull the image. Symptoms:
   `ImagePullBackOff`; the container runtime's image-pull log
   surface shows a 404 / 403 / timeout against `nvcr.io`.
   Resolution: re-quote the image string + tag from the
   per-service public guide reached through
   [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md);
   confirm BlueField reach to `nvcr.io` independently of the
   pod (a documented image-pull probe from the BlueField CLI is
   the cheapest check); engage the operator's network team
   when the BlueField does not have egress to `nvcr.io`. NEVER
   "fix" this by inventing an image tag from memory; that path
   only deepens the failure.
4. **Container-runtime / ENTRYPOINT layer (layer 4).** Image
   pulled, container starts, ENTRYPOINT exits non-zero or the
   pod is in `CrashLoopBackOff`. Symptoms: the container's
   ENTRYPOINT log shows a config-parse error, a missing
   dependency, or a failed internal precondition; the pod
   restart count climbs. Resolution: read the container's last
   full ENTRYPOINT log FIRST (the BlueField container manager's
   documented log-stream command); route the per-service
   config-parse error to the matching per-service skill's
   debug ladder. A pod that crashes twice in a row with the same
   exit signature
   is HIGH-STAKES per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy`](CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy)
   — STOP the retry loop, clear the root cause, only then
   re-enable scheduling.
5. **Volume-mount layer (layer 5).** Pod runs but the container
   cannot read / write a path the pod-spec names. Symptoms:
   ENTRYPOINT log shows permission / not-found errors on a
   mounted path; the per-service config file is mounted but
   empty / missing. Resolution: confirm the host path exists on
   the BlueField; confirm the container user can read / write
   it per the per-service guide; re-quote the volume-mount
   shape from the public Container Deployment Guide. A
   directory bind-mounted where a file was expected (or vice
   versa) is the canonical trap.
6. **Network-policy / host-firewall layer (layer 6).** Pod
   runs, the service inside is up, but a paired peer cannot
   reach it (or the service cannot reach a paired peer).
   Symptoms: liveness probe times out; an external client
   cannot connect; outbound to NGC / upstream PTP master / TOR
   / S3 endpoint hangs. Resolution: confirm host network
   reachability independently of the pod; confirm the pod's
   `hostNetwork` / port mapping matches what the per-service
   guide expects; engage the operator's network team when a
   corporate firewall is in the picture.
7. **Version layer (layer 7).** The pod is healthy, the service
   answers, but the behavior contradicts what the per-service
   guide on the screen describes. Symptoms: a documented field
   name is rejected; a documented "healthy" output line never
   appears. Resolution: walk
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug)
   layer 2 and re-confirm the three version anchors (host DOCA
   on the BlueField Arm, BFB, per-service container tag) per
   [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Version compatibility`](CAPABILITIES.md#version-compatibility).
   A per-service guide on a different DOCA release than the
   container tag is the canonical trap.
8. **Cross-cutting host layer (layer 8).** Deployment looks
   healthy at every layer above but a cross-cutting host issue
   (kernel version, driver loaded / not loaded, hugepage
   allocation, PCIe link state, BFB log surface) breaks the
   service's downstream behavior. Resolution: drop to
   [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug)
   for the cross-cutting debug ladder; engage the operator's
   BlueField OS team.

## Command appendix

Container-deployment commands the verbs above reach for, grouped
by purpose so the agent picks the right family without searching
prose. Every row is a class — the agent must not invent flags
beyond what the row names; flag and command discovery is `--help`
on the installed tool or the public guide, not prose recall.

**Infra-aware preamble (every row below).** Per the bundle's
detect → prefer → fall back → report contract documented in
[`doca-structured-tools-contract ## The agent behavior contract`](../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md#the-agent-behavior-contract),
the agent should:

1. Probe for the matching structured helper FIRST (`doca-env
   --json` for version + devices + libraries + drivers +
   hugepages in one shot; `doca-capability-snapshot` for
   per-device capability flags; `version-matrix.json` for
   *"available since"* lookups).
2. If the probe succeeds, the structured tool's output is the
   authoritative answer and the agent SHOULD NOT also run the
   manual command in the row below. Report *"using structured
   `<tool>`"*.
3. If the probe fails, fall back to the manual command in the
   row. Report *"falling back to manual chain"*.
4. The schemas the structured tools emit are defined in
   [`doca-structured-tools-contract ## Schemas`](../doca-structured-tools-contract/SKILL.md#schemas);
   the version-handling semantics (four-way match, NGC,
   headers-win) are owned by
   [`doca-version`](../doca-version/SKILL.md).

| Purpose | Command (class shape) | Owning step | Reads as healthy when … |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pod lifecycle status | The BlueField container manager's documented pod-status command (per the public DOCA Container Deployment Guide for the BFB on the BlueField) | [`## run`](#run) step 3; [`## debug`](#debug) layers 1 + 2 + 4 | The pod is in `Running` with no recent restart loop; kubelet reports no schedule / image-pull failures. |
| Container ENTRYPOINT log stream | The BlueField container manager's documented log-stream command for the running container | [`## run`](#run) step 4; [`## debug`](#debug) layers 4 + 5 + 6 | The per-service guide's documented bring-up lines appear; no documented error / warning lines repeat. |
| Image-pull verification | The BlueField container runtime's documented image-list / image-pull command after pulling the per-service image string from the public per-service guide | [`## configure`](#configure) step 4; [`## run`](#run) step 1 | The pulled image tag matches what was quoted from the per-service public guide; the image is present locally and the digest is stable. |
| Pod-spec mount inspection | The BlueField container manager's documented inspect command showing the mount list for the running pod | [`## run`](#run) step 2; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 5 | The per-service config file is mounted at the path the per-service guide names; any per-service host paths the pod-spec names are mounted in with the expected permissions. |
| Static-pod manifests directory listing | `ls` on the documented static-pod manifests directory the public DOCA Container Deployment Guide names (path varies by BFB version — quote from the live guide, do NOT memorize) | [`## configure`](#configure) step 5; [`## modify`](#modify) step 6; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 1 | The pod-spec YAML file is present at the documented path; ownership and mode are as the public guide expects; kubelet reconciles every file in the directory into a pod. |
| Per-service liveness signal | The per-service skill's documented liveness command (event-stream output for Argus, gNMI session up + per-RPC counter for DMS, `pmc` / `phc_ctl` + ports state for Firefly, or per-operation counter for UROM service) | [`## run`](#run) step 5; [`## test`](#test) step 1.3 + 1.4; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 4 + 6 | Per the matching per-service skill's "healthy" definition. |
| BlueField precondition probe (firmware slot) | Not applicable to any of the four supported service overlays (none emulate a host-facing PCIe device) — see the firmware-slot disclaimer in [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes). Externally-productized services that do need an emulation slot are out of scope per the Non-goals callout at the top of this file. | n/a for supported services | n/a |
| Image-pull reachability probe to NGC | The BlueField container runtime's documented manifest-pull / probe command against `nvcr.io` (or the documented HTTP probe from the BlueField CLI) | [`## configure`](#configure) step 3; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 3 | The BlueField can reach `nvcr.io` and pull a manifest at the documented tag; no proxy / firewall / air-gap rejects the request. |
| Version anchor — host DOCA (BlueField Arm) | `pkg-config --modversion doca-common` and `doca_caps --version` on the BlueField Arm | [`## configure`](#configure) step 7; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 7 | The two semver strings match each other and match the public DOCA Container Deployment Guide for the operator's release. |
| Version anchor — BFB version | The documented BFB-version command on the BlueField (per the BlueField OS documentation and the public DOCA Container Deployment Guide) | [`## configure`](#configure) step 1 + 7; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 7 | The BFB reports a version the public Container Deployment Guide certifies for the operator's DOCA release. |
| Version anchor — per-service container tag | The BlueField container runtime's documented image-inspect command for the running per-service container | [`## run`](#run) step 1; [`## configure`](#configure) step 7; [`## debug`](#debug) layer 7 | The tag matches what was quoted from the per-service public guide / NGC catalog for the operator's DOCA release; aligns with the host DOCA + BFB versions per the three-anchor contract. |

Three cross-cutting rules for this appendix:

- **Never invent an image string, tag, kubelet flag, pod-spec
  field name, or the static-pod manifests directory path.** The
  public DOCA Container Deployment Guide and the per-service
  guide reached through
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md)
  are the contract; prose-derived strings are the most common
  hallucination failure for this skill.
- **Kubelet status before container logs; container logs before
  per-service liveness.** When triaging, read kubelet's pod-
  status surface first (does kubelet think the pod is up?);
  only then read the container runtime's log stream (did the
  ENTRYPOINT parse the config and run?); only then read the
  per-service liveness signal (does the service actually serve
  its purpose?). Reading the per-service signal against a pod
  that kubelet has reported as `Pending` is meaningless.
- **Cross-link instead of duplicate.** Cross-cutting env
  commands (port-state, `devlink`, `ip link`, `ethtool` on the
  BlueField, `lspci` on the host) live in
  [`doca-setup TASKS.md ## Command appendix`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#command-appendix)
  and
  [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug);
  this appendix names only the container-deployment-specific
  ones. Per-service liveness commands live in the matching
  per-service skill's Command appendix.

## Deferred task verbs

- **Per-service config-schema authoring** (Argus runtime-security
  policy; DMS gNMI / gNOI endpoint config; Firefly four-axis PTP
  config; UROM
  service operations-endpoint config) — out of scope here. Route
  to the matching per-service skill's `## configure` and
  `## modify` workflows; this skill names *that* a config file
  must be mounted, not *what* the per-service field names are.
- **Installing DOCA on the BlueField target** — out of scope
  here. Route to
  [`doca-setup ## configure`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure)
  for env preparation and
  [`doca-setup ## test`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#test) for
  install health verification, or
  [`doca-setup ## no-install`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install)
  for the public NGC DOCA container path if there is no DOCA
  install yet.
- **Flipping a BlueField firmware emulation slot** — out of scope
  here for two reasons. First, none of the four supported service
  overlays emulate a host-facing PCIe device, so none of them
  require an emulation slot (see the firmware-slot disclaimer in
  [`CAPABILITIES.md ## Capabilities and modes`](CAPABILITIES.md#capabilities-and-modes)).
  Second, externally-productized NVIDIA services that *do* require
  a slot are themselves out of scope per the Non-goals callout at
  the top of this file; the firmware-tool workflow itself is owned
  by [`doca-setup ## configure`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure)
  and the public BlueField firmware-configuration documentation.
- **Building a paired-workload application** (host-side time-sync
  follower behind Firefly, gNMI client behind DMS, custom analyzer
  against Argus, paired host↔DPU
  workload behind UROM service) — not a container-deployment
  question. Route to the matching per-service skill's
  deferred-verbs block, which itself routes to the per-library
  skill ([`doca-telemetry-exporter`](../libs/doca-telemetry-exporter/SKILL.md),
  [`doca-flow`](../libs/doca-flow/SKILL.md),
  [`doca-rmax`](../libs/doca-rmax/SKILL.md), …) when the paired
  workload is a DOCA-using application.
- **Operating a full Kubernetes cluster** (cluster API,
  `kubectl`, `Deployment` / `Service` / `Ingress` objects,
  cluster-wide observability, CNI overlays) — out of scope here.
  This skill covers kubelet *standalone* mode on the BlueField,
  not a full Kubernetes control plane. For Kubernetes-scale DPU
  provisioning, see DOCA Platform Framework on GitHub via
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## Public source code: GitHub`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#public-source-code-github).
- **Authoring or rebuilding a DOCA service container image** —
  out of scope here. The container ships pre-built from NGC at
  the tag the per-service public guide names; rebuilding it
  from source is not an external-operator workflow. Route to
  the per-service public guide via
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services).
- **Cross-cutting host-side debug** (BlueField kernel, driver
  loaded / not loaded, hugepage allocation, PCIe link state) —
  out of scope here. Route to
  [`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug).

## Cross-cutting

- The public DOCA Container Deployment Guide is the single
  source of truth for the kubelet-standalone-mode runtime, the
  static-pod manifests directory path, the pod-spec shape, the
  mount contract, the image-pull procedure, and the lifecycle
  commands. Per-service guides own the per-service overlay.
- The runtime is uniform across every DOCA service on the
  BlueField. The agent's job is to walk the shared runtime here,
  then route to the per-service skill for the overlay — not to
  re-state the runtime inside the per-service skill.
- The three version anchors (host DOCA on BlueField Arm, BFB
  version, per-service container tag) must all align. A
  mismatch among any two is the canonical *"the docs say this
  should work but it does not"* failure mode.
- Smoke before bulk. The documented smoke (pod reaches
  `Running`; ENTRYPOINT log shows config parsed and bring-up
  lines complete; per-service liveness signal healthy; trivial
  liveness probe answered) goes BEFORE any per-service workload
  on top, never after.
- Failed pod restart is HIGH-STAKES. A pod that recurringly
  crashes is no longer evidence the deployment can self-heal;
  stop the retry loop, clear the root cause, only then re-enable
  scheduling. Letting kubelet loop a known-broken pod is
  delayed diagnosis, not resilience.
- The agent does NOT invent pod-spec field names, kubelet
  flags, image tags, or the static-pod manifests directory
  path. Quote each from the public DOCA Container Deployment
  Guide plus the per-service guide reached through
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).
- For URL routing to the Container Deployment Guide, the
  per-service guides, and the NGC catalog, see
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services).
