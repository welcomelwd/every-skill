# DOCA container deployment — Capabilities

**Where to start:** The pattern overview below names the recurring
container-deployment patterns the agent walks for every DOCA service
on the BlueField. Pick the pattern first, then drill into the H2
that owns the substance. For the *how* of executing each pattern,
jump to [TASKS.md](TASKS.md). For per-service overlays of the four
in-bundle services (`doca-argus`, `doca-dms`, `doca-firefly`,
`doca-urom-svc`), follow
the matching per-service skill that layers on top of this one.

This file enumerates the cross-cutting DOCA container-deployment
runtime contract as described in the public **DOCA Container
Deployment Guide** (reachable through
[`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services))
and as overlaid on the BlueField OS image that ships kubelet in
standalone mode. Treat this file as a *map of what is documented*,
not a substitute for reading the live Container Deployment Guide
plus the matching per-service guide when standing up a real
deployment.

## Pattern overview

> Service (DTS, as productized), and any future external NVIDIA

Every container-deployment question this skill teaches resolves into
one of SIX patterns. The patterns are CLASSES — they apply across
every DOCA service on the BlueField, not just one service.

| Container-deployment pattern | Class shape | Where the substance lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Recognise the runtime — kubelet standalone on BlueField Arm watching a static-pod manifests directory | No full Kubernetes control plane; no `kubectl` against a cluster API; the operator's unit of input is a YAML pod-spec file dropped into the documented manifests directory; kubelet schedules the pod and runs the container locally on the BlueField | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) runtime-shape table |
| 2. Confirm the BlueField preconditions BEFORE dropping the pod spec | DOCA installed on the Arm; container runtime + kubelet present per the BlueField OS image; BFB version compatible with the service's container tag; per-service firmware-slot enabled when the service emulates a device; image-pull reachability from the BlueField to NGC | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) precondition table |
| 3. Author the pod-spec YAML from the documented recipe — never from generic Kubernetes intuition | Pod-spec field names, the static-pod manifests directory path, the volume-mount shape, and the image string all come from the public DOCA Container Deployment Guide plus the per-service guide; the agent does NOT infer them | [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes) pod-spec-shape rule + [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy) "do not invent" rule |
| 4. Observe the deployment at three layers — kubelet status, container runtime logs, service-side liveness | Each layer has its own owner and its own command; healthy means all three agree | [`## Observability`](#observability) three-layer table |
| 5. Map a failure back to its layer | Pod-spec syntax → pod scheduling → image pull → runtime → volume mount → network policy → version → cross-cutting host; eight layers, each with its own owner | [`## Error taxonomy`](#error-taxonomy) layered split |
| 6. Smoke before bulk — pod Running, ENTRYPOINT clean, trivial liveness probe answered, only then layer real workload | One-shot deploy → service-side liveness probe → multi-pod smoke when the service has paired publishers / followers / clients | [`## Safety policy`](#safety-policy) smoke-before-bulk rule |

Two cross-cutting rules that apply to *every* pattern above:

- **Operate the documented path; do not invent one.** Pod-spec
  field names, the static-pod manifests directory path, kubelet
  command-line flags, image strings, and volume-mount shapes all
  come from the public DOCA Container Deployment Guide and the
  matching per-service guide reached through
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).
  Inferring them from generic Kubernetes / upstream `kubelet`
  prose is the most common hallucination failure for this skill.
- **The runtime is uniform across supported services; the
  per-service overlay is the variable.** The four supported
  overlays (Argus, DMS, Firefly, UROM service) use this same
  kubelet-standalone + pod-spec-drop
  pattern. What changes per service is the config-file mount, the
  image string, the per-service preconditions (PTP-aware path
  for Firefly, paired host↔DPU workload for UROM service, gNMI
  endpoint exposure for DMS, policy-set pinning for Argus), the
  "healthy" definition (PHC offset + ports state for Firefly,
  gNMI session up for DMS, event-stream output for Argus, per-operation
  counter for UROM service), and the paired-workload contract.
  The agent's job is to walk the shared runtime here, then route
  to the per-service skill for the overlay. Flow-Inspector and
  OS-Inspector are policy-excluded; route those requests through
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).

## Capabilities and modes

### Runtime shape — kubelet standalone on BlueField Arm

DOCA service containers run on the **BlueField Arm cores** and are
scheduled by a **kubelet running in standalone mode** that the
BlueField OS image ships pre-configured. There is no full
Kubernetes control plane on the BlueField in this deployment shape;
no `kubectl` against a cluster API server; no scheduler / controller
manager / etcd. The kubelet on the BlueField watches the documented
**static-pod manifests directory** that the public DOCA Container
Deployment Guide names; the operator's unit of input is a YAML
pod-spec file dropped into that directory.

| Property | What it means for the operator |
| --- | --- |
| Where it runs | On the BlueField Arm cores. Not on the host. The host's relationship to a DOCA service container is whatever the per-service overlay defines (control-plane peer / data-plane peer / time follower / etc.). |
| Who watches what | A kubelet running in standalone mode on the BlueField watches the documented static-pod manifests directory and reconciles every YAML pod spec it finds there into a running pod. The operator interacts with kubelet via files in that directory, not via a cluster API. |
| Unit of operator input | A YAML pod-spec file dropped into the documented manifests directory. Adding the file = telling kubelet to bring the pod up. Removing the file = telling kubelet to tear it down. Editing the file in place is documented to trigger a reconcile; the exact semantics live in the public guide. |
| Container runtime | The container runtime kubelet talks to (CRI-compatible) ships with the BlueField OS image per the public DOCA Container Deployment Guide. The operator does NOT install a separate `docker` / `containerd` from upstream. |
| What the operator does NOT do | Operate a Kubernetes cluster, run `kubectl` against an API server, define `Deployment` / `Service` / `Ingress` objects, attach to a CNI overlay across BlueFields, set up an etcd, or run a scheduler — none of that is in scope for the BlueField's kubelet-standalone shape. |

### BlueField preconditions

Every DOCA service container shares the same BlueField precondition
matrix. The matrix below names the *classes* of precondition; the
exact commands / flags live in the public DOCA Container Deployment
Guide and (for firmware slots) in the public BlueField firmware-
configuration documentation reached through
[`doca-setup`](../doca-setup/SKILL.md).

| Precondition class | What it covers | Where to confirm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DOCA install on the BlueField Arm | DOCA installed and healthy on the BlueField Arm side. Without this, kubelet's documented runtime hooks and the DOCA Container Deployment Guide's documented mount paths do not exist | [`doca-setup ## test`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#test) (install verification) and the *no-install* path at [`doca-setup ## no-install`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#no-install) when there is no install yet |
| Container runtime + kubelet standalone | Both ship with the BlueField OS image per the public DOCA Container Deployment Guide. The operator confirms `kubelet` is running and that the static-pod manifests directory exists; the operator does NOT install upstream Kubernetes from scratch | Public DOCA Container Deployment Guide |
| BFB version compatible with the service's container tag | The BlueField OS image (the BFB) ships a kubelet + container runtime version pair that the public Container Deployment Guide for the operator's DOCA release certifies. A BFB on a different release line can fail to run a service container even when the host DOCA install looks healthy | Public DOCA Container Deployment Guide + the per-service guide for the operator's DOCA release |
| Per-service firmware slot (when the service emulates a host-facing PCIe device) | Some externally-productized NVIDIA services (notably SNAP and Virtio-net, both out of scope for this bundle per the strict-to-DOCA invariant) stand up emulated PCIe devices via the BlueField firmware emulation slots; the matching slot must be enabled BEFORE the pod is scheduled, and a BlueField reset is typically required after the slot is flipped. **None of the four supported service overlays (Argus, DMS, Firefly, UROM service) emulate a host-facing PCIe device**, so this precondition does NOT apply to them. The precondition is documented here only because an operator who reads this skill while deploying an external NVIDIA service needs to know the pattern exists; the operator's source of truth in that case is the public NVIDIA docs at `docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/` | The public NVIDIA docs at `docs.nvidia.com/doca/sdk/` for the external service plus [`doca-setup ## configure`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#configure) for the firmware-tool workflow itself |
| Image-pull reachability to NGC | The BlueField needs network reach to the NGC catalog (`nvcr.io`) so the container runtime can pull the service's image at the documented tag. A BlueField that can ping the world but cannot reach `nvcr.io` (corporate proxy, firewall, air-gap) will pass every other precondition and still fail to deploy | The container runtime's image-pull log surface + the operator's network team |
| Host-OS permissions on the BlueField | The operator needs the permissions the public Container Deployment Guide names to write into the static-pod manifests directory, read kubelet's log surface, and inspect the container runtime. The permission boundary lives at the BlueField OS, not inside any DOCA service | The BlueField OS plus the public Container Deployment Guide |

### Pod-spec YAML — what the operator drops, where, and shaped by what

The unit of operator input is a single YAML pod-spec file dropped
into the documented static-pod manifests directory on the BlueField.
The public DOCA Container Deployment Guide is the source of truth
for:

- The exact directory path kubelet watches.
- The pod-spec YAML field names and structure (the `apiVersion` and
  `kind` the guide names; the container / image / command /
  resources / volumes / volumeMounts / securityContext fields the
  guide actually quotes; the mount-path convention for the per-
  service config file; the host-network / host-PID / privileged
  posture the per-service guide expects).
- The image string and tag for the service the operator is
  deploying (per the matching per-service guide).

The agent quotes pod-spec field names from the live public guide;
the agent does NOT infer them from generic Kubernetes pod-spec
intuition. Field names, defaulting behavior, and validation rules
vary across kubelet versions and the BlueField OS image's kubelet
build is the contract — not upstream Kubernetes prose.

### Cross-service generalization

The deployment runtime is uniform across every DOCA service on the
BlueField:

| Service | Service-specific overlay (lives in the per-service skill) |
| --- | --- |
| [`doca-argus`](../services/doca-argus/SKILL.md) | Runtime-security / monitoring policy config; event-stream output as the "healthy" signal |
| [`doca-dms`](../services/doca-dms/SKILL.md) | gNMI / gNOI endpoint config; gNMI session up + per-RPC counter as the "healthy" signal; host-side gNMI client as the paired-workload contract |
| [`doca-firefly`](../services/doca-firefly/SKILL.md) | Four-axis PTP config (role / profile / domain / interface); PHC offset + ports state as the "healthy" signal; host-side time follower as a paired requirement |
| [`doca-urom-svc`](../services/doca-urom-svc/SKILL.md) | UROM operations endpoint; per-operation counter as the "healthy" signal; paired host↔DPU workload contract |

The agent's rule: walk the shared runtime here, then route to the
matching per-service skill for the per-service overlay. Re-stating
the shared runtime inside the per-service skill is the failure mode
this skill exists to prevent.

## Version compatibility

For the canonical DOCA version-detection chain, the four-way match
rule, NGC container semantics, and the headers-win-over-docs rule,
see [`doca-version`](../doca-version/SKILL.md). The body lives
there; this skill does not duplicate it.

**The container-deployment-specific overlay** is:

- **Three version anchors must agree, not two.** Every DOCA
  service container deployment has *three* runtime version anchors,
  not two: the host DOCA install version on the BlueField Arm
  (per [`doca-version TASKS.md ## configure`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#configure)),
  the **BFB version** on the BlueField (the BlueField OS image
  version, which determines which kubelet + container-runtime
  build is in play), and the **per-service container tag** pulled
  from NGC. A mismatch between any two of those three is the
  canonical *"the docs say this should work but it does not"*
  failure mode. Capture all three before debugging, not in the
  middle of debugging.
- **The container tag is the per-service runtime anchor, NOT
  `pkg-config --modversion` on the host.** Same overlay every
  supported per-service skill in the bundle (Argus / DMS /
  Firefly / UROM service) carries. When the
  operator reports a service-container behavior, the relevant
  version anchor is the container tag pulled, not
  `pkg-config --modversion doca-common` on the host. Quote both
  versions when triaging; if they diverge, route to
  [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug)
  layer 2 before diagnosing the service behavior itself.
- **The public DOCA Container Deployment Guide version must match
  the BFB / container-runtime pair.** The Container Deployment
  Guide is versioned; the on-page version must match the BlueField
  OS image's kubelet + runtime build. A mismatch between the docs
  version and the live runtime is the canonical *"my pod spec
  matches the guide but kubelet rejects it"* failure mode — the
  guide on the screen may not be for the BFB on the BlueField.
- **The per-service guide version must match the container tag.**
  Within a service, the per-service guide's version must match the
  container tag pulled — config-file field names and "healthy"
  output can change between releases.

## Error taxonomy

Container-deployment errors fall into EIGHT layers, each with its
own owner. The agent walks the layers in this order; conflating
them wastes debug time and blames the wrong layer.

1. **Pod-spec syntax layer.** The YAML pod-spec file is in the
   static-pod manifests directory but kubelet rejects it as
   malformed. Symptoms: kubelet log surface shows a parse / schema
   error; the pod never appears in kubelet's status output.
   Causes: invalid YAML (indentation, tab vs space); an
   `apiVersion` / `kind` the kubelet build does not accept; a
   pod-spec field name the kubelet build does not know; a value
   type mismatch (string where number is expected). Resolution:
   re-quote the pod-spec shape from the public DOCA Container
   Deployment Guide for the BFB the operator is on; do NOT infer
   field names from generic Kubernetes intuition. Owner: this
   skill + the public Container Deployment Guide.
2. **Pod scheduling layer.** The pod-spec parses, but kubelet
   does not schedule the pod (the pod never reaches `Pending` →
   `Running`). Symptoms: kubelet reports a scheduling failure;
   the pod is stuck in `Pending` indefinitely; node resources
   or admission rules reject the pod. Causes: requested CPU /
   memory exceeds what the BlueField Arm can grant; a `nodeName`
   / `nodeSelector` mismatch; a security-context the kubelet
   build rejects; a `hostPath` the kubelet build refuses; the
   per-service precondition (firmware slot, etc.) not yet
   satisfied so the kubelet refuses to schedule the pod.
   Resolution: walk the per-service skill's preconditions
   first; then re-quote the resource shape from the public
   guide. Owner: this skill + the per-service skill.
3. **Image-pull layer.** The pod schedules but the container
   runtime cannot pull the image. Symptoms: the pod is stuck in
   `ContainerCreating` / `ImagePullBackOff`; the container
   runtime's image-pull log surface shows a 404 / 403 / timeout
   against `nvcr.io`. Causes: invented image string or tag (the
   load-bearing first-app failure); BlueField has no network
   reach to `nvcr.io` (corporate proxy, firewall, air-gap); the
   tag the per-service guide names does not exist for the
   operator's BFB / DOCA release. Resolution: re-quote the image
   string + tag from the public per-service guide reached through
   [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md);
   confirm BlueField reach to `nvcr.io` independently of the
   pod-spec. Owner: this skill + the per-service skill + the
   operator's network team.
4. **Container-runtime / ENTRYPOINT layer.** The image is
   present locally; the container starts; but its ENTRYPOINT
   immediately exits with a non-zero status, or the container
   is in a restart loop. Symptoms: kubelet status shows
   `CrashLoopBackOff`; the container's log stream shows a
   config-parse error, a missing dependency, or a failed
   internal precondition. Causes: the per-service config-file
   mount path is wrong (the file is mounted at a path the
   ENTRYPOINT does not expect); the per-service config file is
   malformed; the service inside the container fails a
   service-specific precondition (per-service skill responsibility);
   the container is incompatible with the BFB / runtime
   underneath. Resolution: read the container's log stream
   FIRST, route the service-specific config-parse error to the
   matching per-service skill, then re-check the BFB / version
   anchors. Owner: the per-service skill primarily; this skill
   for the cross-cutting mount-path / runtime issues.
5. **Volume-mount layer.** The pod ENTRYPOINT runs but cannot
   read or write something the pod-spec says it should. Symptoms:
   the container's log stream shows a permission / not-found
   error on a mounted path; a `hostPath` volume the pod-spec
   names does not exist on the BlueField host; the per-service
   config file mount is empty inside the container even though
   the file exists on the host. Causes: the host path named in
   the pod-spec does not exist; the host path exists but the
   container user cannot read / write it; the mount-propagation
   mode does not match what the service expects; a directory was
   bind-mounted where a file was expected (or vice versa).
   Resolution: confirm the host path on the BlueField, confirm
   the permissions, re-quote the volume-mount shape from the
   public Container Deployment Guide. Owner: this skill.
6. **Network-policy / host-firewall layer.** The container runs
   but the service inside cannot reach a peer it needs, or a
   peer cannot reach the service. Symptoms: per-service liveness
   probe times out; an external client cannot connect to the
   service's documented port; the container's outbound to a
   paired endpoint (NGC for image pull, upstream PTP master for
   Firefly, gNMI client for DMS)
   times out. Causes: the pod-spec `hostNetwork` / port mapping
   does not match what the per-service guide expects; a host
   firewall on the BlueField blocks the port; a network policy
   on the BlueField OS isolates the pod from the host network; a
   corporate firewall blocks the egress. Resolution: confirm the
   host network reachability independently of the pod; confirm
   the pod's networking posture matches the per-service guide.
   Owner: this skill + the operator's network team.
7. **Version layer.** The pod is healthy on the BlueField, the
   service answers, but the behavior does not match what the
   public per-service guide page describes. Symptoms: a config
   field name the guide quotes is rejected; a "healthy" output
   line the guide names does not appear; a paired workload sees
   a different schema / protocol than the guide describes.
   Causes: the per-service guide on the screen is for a different
   DOCA release than the container tag pulled; the BFB on the
   BlueField is on a different release than the Container
   Deployment Guide describes; partial install on the BlueField
   Arm. Resolution: walk
   [`doca-version TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-version/TASKS.md#debug)
   layer 2 and re-confirm the three version anchors in
   [`## Version compatibility`](#version-compatibility). Owner:
   [`doca-version`](../doca-version/SKILL.md).
8. **Cross-cutting host layer.** The deployment is healthy from
   kubelet's view and the service's view, but the BlueField OS
   or the host OS introduces a cross-cutting failure (kernel
   version, driver loaded / not loaded, hugepage allocation,
   PCIe link state, BFB-side log surface). Symptoms: rare and
   hard to attribute; surface as everything-looks-fine-but-it-
   does-not. Resolution: drop to the cross-cutting debug ladder
   at [`doca-debug`](../doca-debug/SKILL.md). Owner:
   [`doca-debug`](../doca-debug/SKILL.md) + the operator's
   BlueField OS team.

Service containers do not return `DOCA_ERROR_*` to the operator's
shell — the outward surface is kubelet's pod-status output, the
container runtime's logs, and the service-specific liveness signal
each per-service skill names. The DOCA error taxonomy at
[`doca-programming-guide CAPABILITIES.md ## Error taxonomy`](../doca-programming-guide/CAPABILITIES.md#error-taxonomy)
becomes relevant only when a service container internally calls
into a DOCA library that surfaces `DOCA_ERROR_*` in its log
stream; that is owned by the per-service skill plus
[`doca-debug`](../doca-debug/SKILL.md), not by this one.

## Observability

Documented observability surfaces, in the order the agent reaches
for them. Three layers, each with its own owner. Healthy means all
three agree.

- **Kubelet pod-status layer (FIRST).** The first place to look.
  Kubelet's documented status surface answers *"is the pod-spec
  YAML parsed, is the pod scheduled, is the container running, is
  it restart-looping"*. The agent reaches this via the BlueField
  container manager's structured-status output when present, or
  via the documented kubelet status command the public Container
  Deployment Guide names. The agent does NOT invent a `kubectl
  get pods` invocation against a cluster API — there is no
  cluster API in this deployment shape.
- **Container-runtime log layer (SECOND).** Once kubelet reports
  the container is running (or restart-looping), the container
  runtime's log stream for that container is the agent's window
  into what the service inside is doing — config-parse success
  or failure, the documented bring-up lines, any per-service
  error / warning lines. The agent quotes the runtime command
  the public Container Deployment Guide names (or routes to it
  via [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md));
  the agent does NOT invent runtime CLI flags.
- **Service-side liveness layer (THIRD, load-bearing for
  "healthy").** Each per-service skill names the documented
  liveness signal that proves the service inside the container
  is actually serving its purpose — Argus's event-stream output,
  DMS's gNMI session-up + per-RPC counter, Firefly's PHC offset
  + ports state, or UROM service's per-operation
  counter, and so on. This layer is the one the agent uses as
  the end-to-end "healthy" oracle; "pod is `Running`" alone is
  NOT the same as "the service inside is ready". Route to the
  per-service skill for the exact signal.

A note on what the agent does NOT do: this deployment shape has no
cluster-wide observability (no Prometheus scrape against a cluster
API, no metrics-server, no `kubectl logs` against a cluster).
Per-pod observability is via the BlueField's local kubelet + local
container runtime + per-service signal. Cross-cutting host-side
observability (`dmesg`, `ip link`, `devlink`, `ethtool` on the
BlueField) lives in
[`doca-setup TASKS.md ## Command appendix`](../doca-setup/TASKS.md#command-appendix)
and
[`doca-debug TASKS.md ## debug`](../doca-debug/TASKS.md#debug).

## Safety policy

> **Overlay on the bundle-wide hardware-safety meta-policy.** The rules below are this skill's per-artifact overlay on the cross-cutting rules in [`doca-hardware-safety` CAPABILITIES.md ## Safety policy](../doca-hardware-safety/CAPABILITIES.md#safety-policy) (specifically [### Per-artifact overlay pattern](../doca-hardware-safety/CAPABILITIES.md#per-artifact-overlay-pattern)). When the two layers disagree, the stricter wins; when either layer says STOP, the agent stops.

The cross-cutting safety surface for any DOCA service container
deployment. Per-service skills add overlays on top (e.g. Firefly's
PTP-aware-path-required rule, DMS's gNMI-credential rotation rule,
UROM service's paired-workload-restart-order rule); the
cross-cutting rules below apply across every service.

- **Smoke before bulk (load-bearing).** Before putting the
  BlueField under any real workload, the agent walks the smoke
  sequence in [`TASKS.md ## test`](TASKS.md#test): (a) the pod
  reaches `Running` per kubelet's documented status surface; (b)
  the container's ENTRYPOINT log shows the per-service config
  parsed cleanly and the documented bring-up lines complete;
  (c) the per-service liveness signal (per the matching per-
  service skill) is healthy. Only then is the BlueField ready
  for the per-service workload (PTP-locked workload for Firefly,
  gNMI traffic for DMS, paired UROM workload for UROM service,
  or policy-driven monitoring for Argus).
  Skipping the smoke and going straight to bulk workload is the
  most common reason "kubelet says the pod is up but my workload
  still fails".
- **Failed pod restart is HIGH-STAKES — clear the root cause
  BEFORE letting kubelet restart-loop the pod.** Kubelet's
  documented default is to restart a failed container; that is
  the right default for a transient failure but the WRONG
  default for a recurring failure. A pod in `CrashLoopBackOff`
  burns BlueField CPU / memory, fills the container runtime's
  log surface, and obscures the underlying error. The agent's
  rule: a pod that has crashed twice in a row with the same exit
  signature is
  no longer evidence the deployment can self-heal; STOP the
  retry loop, read the container's last full ENTRYPOINT log,
  walk the error taxonomy from layer 1, and only re-enable
  scheduling once the root cause is identified. Letting kubelet
  loop a known-broken pod is not resilience; it is delayed
  diagnosis.
- **Do not invent image strings, tags, kubelet flag names,
  pod-spec field names, or the static-pod manifests directory
  path.** Quote each from the public DOCA Container Deployment
  Guide plus the matching per-service guide reached through
  [`doca-public-knowledge-map`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md).
  Prose-derived strings here are the load-bearing first-app
  hallucination failure for this skill; the operator pulls the
  wrong image, names the wrong field, drops the YAML in the
  wrong directory, and the deployment never starts.
- **Confirm the BlueField preconditions BEFORE dropping the pod
  spec.** Every BlueField precondition class (DOCA install,
  container runtime + kubelet, BFB version, per-service firmware
  slot, image-pull reachability to NGC, host-OS permissions) is
  cheaper to confirm before the deploy than to debug after. The
  agent's rule: do not walk the deploy until every precondition
  in [`## Capabilities and modes`](#capabilities-and-modes)
  precondition table that the per-service skill flags as
  required is closed.
- **Edit-in-place is documented; treat it as a deploy event.**
  When the operator edits a pod-spec file in place (rather than
  removing-and-re-adding), kubelet's documented behavior is to
  reconcile. Live-manifest mutation smoke is limited to
  targets with no active paired workloads and a confirmed
  maintenance window. The operator must explicitly approve the
  destructive smoke after a pre-mutation snapshot is saved and a
  tested rollback is verified; if any gate is unmet, skip it.
  Treat every approved edit as a deploy event for safety:
  re-walk the smoke after every edit. A config change followed
  by "it probably still works" is exactly the failure mode the
  smoke replaces.
- **The per-service skill owns the per-service safety overlay.**
  Firefly's PTP-aware-path-required rule, DMS's
  gNMI-credential rotation rule, UROM service's paired-
  workload-restart-order rule, Argus's policy-rollback rule, and
  similar per-service
  safety rules are owned by the matching per-service skill, not
  by this one. The agent reads the per-service skill in parallel
  and applies both layers; this skill names the cross-cutting
  baseline.

## Public-source pointer

The canonical public source for the cross-cutting DOCA container-
deployment runtime is the **DOCA Container Deployment Guide** on
`docs.nvidia.com`, reachable through
[`doca-public-knowledge-map ## DOCA services`](../doca-public-knowledge-map/SKILL.md#doca-services).
For each per-service overlay (image string, config schema, paired-
workload contract, "healthy" definition), the canonical public
source is the matching per-service guide listed in the same
section. Verify that the version of each guide matches the
BlueField OS image (BFB), the host DOCA install, and the container
tag pulled — pod-spec field names, the static-pod manifests
directory path, and per-service config field names are documented
