# Investigating Evaluation Results (Vally)

This guide is for AI agents (and humans) investigating skill evaluation failures produced by the **Vally** harness via `eng/vally-adapter/adapt.mjs`. It documents the `results.json` schema, how to reach the raw Vally output, common failure patterns, and recommended fixes.

Evaluations run through Vally (`@microsoft/vally-cli`): every skill's `tests/<plugin>/<skill>/eval.yaml` is run in up to three variants — **baseline** (no skills), **skilled** (only the skill under test), and **plugin** (the whole plugin loaded). The adapter then runs `vally compare` (a debiased, position-swapped head-to-head judgment of skilled vs baseline) and writes one `results.json` per skill.

> Note: the linter (`skill-validator check`) is a **separate** workflow (`skill-check.yml`) and is unrelated to these eval results.

## Using this guide with an AI agent

When an evaluation has failures, the PR comment includes a ready-to-use prompt — copy it to your AI agent. The agent downloads the artifacts, reads this guide, analyzes the `results.json` files, and suggests fixes.

## Quick start

1. **Download the results artifacts:** `gh run download <run-id> --repo dotnet/skills --pattern "vally-results-*" --dir ./eval-results`
2. **Skim the run's step summary** (the "Full Results" link) for the consolidated pass/fail table.
3. **Read each `results.json`** (`eval-results/vally-results-*/<plugin>/<skill>/results.json`) for the compare verdict and per-scenario metrics.
4. **Identify the failure pattern** using the categories below and fix in priority order: infra/errored trials → timeouts → activation → quality/preference.
5. **Apply the fix** and re-run with `/evaluate`.

> The `--pattern "vally-results-*"` flag matters — without it, `gh` also tries to download non-zip artifacts and exits non-zero.

## The PR comment

`eng/vally-adapter/consolidate.mjs` renders the comment (and the fuller step summary). Its table has these columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Skill` | Skill under test |
| `Result` | ✅ credible net win / 🔻 credible regression / ❌ no credible change / ⚠️ the gate withheld a verdict (underpowered eval, or a comparison that errored, had unmatched trials, or contradicted itself) |
| `Net win` | `(wins − losses) / trials`. **The deciding effect size** |
| `p` | One-sided exact sign test over the discordant (non-tie) trials. A skill passes only at `p ≤ 0.05`, which needs at least 5 winning trials |
| `Δ Pref` | The same comparison weighted by how decisive each win was (`much-better` ±100%, `slightly-better` ±40%). Triage only; deliberately not gated on |
| `W/T/L` | Wins / ties / losses across trials |
| `Quality` (+ `Quality (Plugin)` in the full step summary) / `Baseline` | Mean absolute judge score 0–5 for skilled isolated (and plugin) vs the skill-free control |
| `Overfit` | Overfitting-judge severity — ✅ Low, 🟡 Moderate, 🔴 High, — none — with its score |
| `Skills Loaded` | Of scenarios that expect activation, how many the skill activated / that total (plugin run shown when present); ⚠️ flags a scenario that expected activation but didn't activate |

A collapsible **Column legend** and a per-skill **details** block follow the table. Each details block shows the verdict `reason` and a `Scenario | Mean preference | Trials (W/T/L)` table, so per-scenario detail is one click away in the PR itself. `--format full` (the step summary) adds the `Quality (Plugin)` column; `--format simple` (the PR comment) omits it. Both formats include the Overfit, Skills Loaded, legend, and details.

## Understanding `results.json`

Each file has a top-level object:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `model` | Model used for agent runs |
| `judgeModel` | Model used by `vally compare` |
| `timestamp` | When results were written (UTC) |
| `verdicts[]` | Per-skill results (one entry, since the adapter writes one file per skill) |

### Verdict structure

A verdict carries **both** the head-to-head preference (what gates the PR) and absolute per-role data (what the dashboard charts).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `skillName` / `skillPath` | The skill under test |
| `passed` | **The gate.** `true` only on a credible net win: more wins than losses at `signTest.pValue <= 0.05`, `conclusive`, and not `underpowered` |
| `netWin` | `(wins − losses) / trials` — the effect size the gate reads. Magnitude-free, so an identical W/T/L record always yields an identical verdict |
| `signTest` | `{ wins, ties, losses, discordant, pValue, alpha }` — exact one-sided binomial tail over the discordant (non-tie) trials. **This is what decides.** Ties can't support a win, so they hold `discordant` down |
| `regressed` | `true` when the *losses* are credible by the same test — the mirror of `passed` |
| `conclusive` | `false` when the comparison didn't complete: errored trials, unmatched trajectories, or a summary that disagrees with its own `stimuli[].trials` |
| `underpowered` | `true` when a *completed* comparison counted fewer than `minCredibleTrials` trials, so no record could have reached `p <= 0.05`. Rendered ⚠️ — never a pass, never a regression. Disjoint from `conclusive` |
| `minCredibleTrials` | The trial floor in force (5). See `eng/eval-quality/README.md` for why |
| `meanScore` | Vally's magnitude-weighted mean preference (`much-better` ±1.0, `slightly-better` ±0.4), −1..1. **Triage only — not the gate**; weighting the statistic by magnitude is what made verdicts flip in dotnet/skills#952 |
| `confidenceInterval` | `{ low, high, level: 0.95 }` — the 95% CI on `meanScore`, reported alongside it |
| `winRate`, `wins`, `ties`, `losses` | Trial-level head-to-head tally as vally reported it |
| `trialCount`, `erroredCount` | Counted trials (scenarios × `defaults.runs`) and how many errored (errored trials don't count toward either statistic) |
| `reason` | Human-readable summary of the above |
| `scenarios[]` | Per-scenario detail (below) |

### Scenario structure

Each scenario merges the compare preference for that stimulus with the absolute per-role runs.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `scenarioName` | The stimulus name from the eval spec |
| `meanScore` / `trials[]` | Compare preference for this stimulus and its per-trial `{ winner, magnitude, score, evidence, errored }` |
| `expectActivation` | Whether the skill is expected to activate (always `true` today) |
| `timedOut` | Whether the skilled run hit its timeout |
| `skillActivationIsolated.activated` | Did the skill activate in the skilled (isolated) run? |
| `skillActivationPlugin.activated` | Did it activate in the plugin run? (present only when a plugin variant ran) |
| `baseline` | `{ judgeResult: { overallScore }, metrics }` — the skill-free control (`overallScore` is 0–5) |
| `skilledIsolated` | Same shape, for the isolated skilled run |
| `skilledPlugin` | Same shape, for the whole-plugin run (may be absent) |

`metrics` on each role: `{ wallTimeMs, tokenEstimate, inputTokens, outputTokens, cacheReadTokens, cacheWriteTokens }`.

## Reaching the raw Vally output

The adapter's `results.json` is a summary. The uploaded artifact also contains the full Vally run under `artifacts/TestResults/vally/<entry>/`:

- `_experiment/<timestamp>/<variant>/results.jsonl` — one `trial-result` record per stimulus per variant, each with the full `trajectory` (`endReason`, `metrics.tokenUsage`, `metrics.skillActivationCount`, `toolCallCount`) and `gradeResult.score` (0–1).
- `_experiment/<timestamp>/executor-session-logs/**/{metadata.json,events.jsonl}` — the per-session event stream (prompts, tool calls, agent output). `metadata.json` carries `variant`, `stimulusName`, `evalName`/`evalFilePath`, `model`, and `status`. This is what powers the AGENTVIZ replay link in the PR comment.

To see exactly what the agent did for a failing scenario, open its `events.jsonl` (match on `variant` + `stimulusName` in the sibling `metadata.json`).

## Failure patterns and fixes

Work top-down; earlier categories often cause later ones.

### 1. Errored or missing trials (`erroredCount > 0`, or a variant produced no records)
The agent crashed, the model was unavailable, or the environment failed. Check the run logs and the variant's `results.jsonl`/session logs. These are usually infra/flake — re-run before treating as a real regression. If the **skilled** or **baseline** variant produced no records, the adapter writes no verdict for that skill (a warning is emitted).

### 2. Timeouts (`scenario.timedOut == true`, `trajectory.endReason == "agent_timeout"`)
The agent didn't finish within the eval's `config.timeout`. Either the task is too large for the budget or the skill sent the agent down a slow path. Fixes: raise `config.timeout` in `eval.yaml` if the task legitimately needs more time, or tighten the skill so it converges faster.

### 3. Skill didn't activate (`skillActivationIsolated.activated == false`)
The skill was available but the agent never invoked it, so "skilled" ≈ "baseline" and no improvement is possible. Fixes: sharpen the skill's `description`/trigger phrasing in `SKILL.md` so the model recognizes when to use it, and make sure the eval prompt actually describes a task the skill targets.

### 4. Underpowered eval (`underpowered == true`)
Not a skill problem — an eval problem. The gate is an exact one-sided sign test over the head-to-head trials, and `trials = scenarios × defaults.runs`. That test cannot reach `p ≤ 0.05` on fewer than five discordant trials (`0.5⁴ = 0.0625`), and discordant trials can never exceed counted trials — so below `minCredibleTrials` (5) **no possible record passes**, however good the skill is.

Do not "fix" the skill in response to this. Fix the eval: add scenarios (strongly preferred — five repeats of one scenario satisfy the arithmetic but still measure the skill on a single task), or declare `defaults: { runs: N }` in its `eval.yaml` so `scenarios × runs >= 5`. If the spec still opens with the deprecated `config:` block, **merge** `runs` into it and rename it `defaults:` — vally's loader throws on a spec declaring both, and that failure surfaces as "Evaluation ran but produced no results", not as a spec error. `eng/eval-quality/check_eval_quality.py` fails any new eval below the floor, rejects the `config:`+`defaults:` combination, and tracks the grandfathered ones in `eng/eval-quality/underpowered-allowlist.txt`.

Clearing the floor is necessary, not sufficient. The sign test conditions on the **discordant** (non-tie) trials, so an eval at exactly 5 counted trials only passes on a flawless 5W/0T/0L sweep — one tie leaves 4 discordant and puts it back below the floor without setting `underpowered`. Check `signTest.discordant`, not `trialCount`, when a record with more wins than losses still fails.

### 5. No credible net win (`passed == false` with `netWin <= 0` or `signTest.pValue > 0.05`)
The judge didn't consistently prefer the skilled run over baseline.
- **`netWin <= 0`** — at least as many losses as wins. Either the skill isn't helping for these scenarios, or the baseline model is already strong here. Strengthen the skill's guidance, or reconsider whether the scenario exercises the skill's value. If `regressed` is also `true`, the losses themselves are credible: the skill is actively hurting.
- **`netWin > 0` but `signTest.pValue > 0.05`** — a real but inconsistent signal: the skill wins some scenarios and ties or loses others. Ties count against here, because they hold the discordant trial count down. Add more/broader scenarios so there is enough evidence, and make the skill help consistently rather than occasionally.
- Do **not** read `meanScore` here. It is magnitude-weighted and reported for triage only; a verdict never turns on it (see `eng/eval-quality/README.md`, "Why the gate scores direction, not magnitude").
- Inspect `scenarios[].trials[].evidence` for the judge's reasoning on losses/ties, and compare the skilled vs baseline `events.jsonl` to see what the skill changed (or failed to change).

### 6. Quality looks fine but the skill still fails the gate
The gate is a **preference** comparison, not an absolute score. A high `skilledIsolated.judgeResult.overallScore` that isn't clearly better than `baseline.judgeResult.overallScore` will not pass. Focus on the *delta* over baseline, not the absolute number.

## Re-running

Push the fix and comment `/evaluate` on the PR (optionally `/evaluate <plugin>` to scope). The workflow re-runs Vally, regenerates the verdicts, and updates the PR comment.
