# Claude Code — For CTOs & Decision Makers

> Your engineering team is probably already using AI coding tools. The question isn't whether to adopt Claude Code — it's whether to do it in a controlled, secure, measurable way or let it happen organically (which means inconsistently).

---

## The business case in 3 data points

- **62-85%** of developers already use AI coding tools daily (Stack Overflow 2025)
- **91%** of organizations have adopted at least one AI tool in their engineering workflow
- Teams with structured Claude Code adoption report **30-50% reduction** in routine coding tasks (config, boilerplate, test generation, code review)

The gap isn't adoption — it's structured adoption. Most teams are using 10% of what Claude Code can do.

## What decision makers need to know

### Security & Compliance

Claude Code runs locally. It does **not** send your codebase to Anthropic — only the specific context you include in a prompt. What matters for compliance:

- Data retention: configurable (0 to 30 days), or disabled
- GDPR: clear opt-out path, no training on your data by default
- Access control: granular permissions per project, per user, per tool
- Audit trail: every action logged via hooks

### Threat landscape

This is the only public resource tracking AI coding tool vulnerabilities: **15 vulnerabilities and 655 malicious skills catalogued**. Key vectors relevant to enterprise:

- Prompt injection via untrusted file content (e.g. malicious comments in dependencies)
- Supply chain attacks via MCP servers (treat like npm packages)
- Overpermissive configs in CI/CD pipelines

Mitigation framework: WP03 (Security in Production, 25 min): [cc.bruniaux.com/whitepapers](https://cc.bruniaux.com/whitepapers/)

### Team adoption

The ROI scales with structure. An individual developer gets 2-3× productivity on routine tasks. A team with shared configuration, hooks, and standardized workflows gets more, with consistent quality and security posture.

Realistic adoption timeline: 4-6 weeks to full team competency with structured onboarding.

## The adoption path that works

Most teams that succeed follow the same sequence:

**1. Pilot (2-3 devs, 2 weeks)**
Identify 2-3 motivated engineers. Let them configure and experiment. Measure time saved on specific tasks (code review, test generation, documentation).

**2. Config standardization (1 week)**
Tech lead or external expert reviews their setup. Creates a shared `CLAUDE.md` for the team. Adds security hooks and CI/CD integration. Documents "what's allowed, what's not."

**3. Team rollout (2-3 weeks)**
1h onboarding session for the full team. Champions support peers. Shared config versioned in the repo.

**4. Governance**
Monthly review of usage patterns, cost, and security posture. Adjust permissions as AI capabilities evolve.

## Costs

Claude Code subscription: $100/month per developer (Claude Max plan, includes full API access).

At a loaded developer cost of €500-700/day, recovering 30 minutes per day per developer pays back the subscription in week 1.

The real cost isn't the subscription — it's unstructured adoption creating security debt and inconsistent output quality.

---

## External support

If you want to accelerate adoption or get an independent assessment of your current setup:

**Brown Bag Lunch, talk, or panel (1-3h, free)** — executive + team intro, live demo, Q&A, or speaker slot. I do these for the pleasure of it — getting challenged, sharing what I know, building network. No strings attached.

**Config audit (half-day)** — review your current setup against security and productivity standards.
**Team formation (1-3 days)** — hands-on training, your codebase, your workflows, measurable outcomes. Not something I'm actively seeking right now, but I'm open to the right conversation.
