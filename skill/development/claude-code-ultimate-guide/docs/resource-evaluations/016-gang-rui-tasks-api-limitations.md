## Summary

Technical analysis of Claude Code Tasks API (v2.1.16+) field visibility limitations discovered through practical usage. Documents that `TaskList` omits `description` and all `metadata` fields, requiring individual `TaskGet` calls to access full task information.

**Key insight**: The Tasks API has an undocumented architectural limitation where list operations (`TaskList`) expose only a subset of fields (`id`, `subject`, `status`, `owner`, `blockedBy`), while detail operations (`TaskGet`) expose all fields. This creates a multi-call overhead pattern not mentioned in official documentation or existing guide materials.

---

## Score: 5/5 (CRITICAL)

### Scoring Justification

**Why CRITICAL (not just "High Value")**:

1. **Breaks recommended workflow**: The guide explicitly recommends "TaskList → Show all tasks" for session resumption (MODE_Task_Management.md:37). Without `description` visibility, this workflow is silently broken.

2. **Hidden cost multiplier**: To review 10 task descriptions requires 1 TaskList + 10 TaskGet calls = **11x API overhead**. For 20 tasks: 21x overhead. This directly impacts:
   - API costs (11x more round-trips)
   - Session latency (11x more waiting)
   - Token consumption (metadata fetched individually)

3. **Broader than initially apparent**: Author states "Metadata is NEVER visible in any output" - this includes:
   - `description` (implementation details)
   - `activeForm` (progress spinner text)
   - ALL custom `metadata` fields (priority, estimates, related files, tags)

4. **Security implication**: Without field visibility in TaskList, users cannot pre-filter sensitive tasks before calling TaskGet. Risk of accidentally exposing sensitive implementation details when sharing task list IDs.

5. **Trust calibration**: If users discover this limitation independently after following guide workflows, it damages guide credibility ("The Ultimate Guide didn't warn me about this trap").

6. **Timing**: Discovered 2 days after Tasks API launch (v2.1.16: 2026-01-22), indicating early adopter friction. Integrating this feedback quickly prevents widespread frustration.

### Score Calibration Reference

| Score | Meaning | This Resource |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 5 | **CRITICAL** - Gap that breaks workflows, causes hidden costs, or damages trust | ✅ Breaks recommended workflow, 11x cost overhead, metadata invisibility |
| 4 | High Value - Significant improvement to guide quality | Would be here if only `description` was affected |
| 3 | Moderate - Useful complement | Would be here if workaround was already documented |

## Key Findings

### 1. Field Visibility Constraint

**From post (exact quote)**:
> "TaskList shows ID, subject, status, and blockedBy but NO description"

**Technical detail from screenshot**:
- TaskList outputs: `id`, `subject`, `status`, `owner`, `blockedBy`
- TaskList hidden: `description`, `activeForm`, `metadata` (all custom fields)
- TaskGet outputs: All fields (full task object)

### 2. Cost Impact

**Multi-call overhead pattern**:
```
Review N tasks with descriptions = 1 TaskList + N TaskGet calls
```

**Examples**:
- 5 tasks: 6 API calls (6x overhead)
- 10 tasks: 11 calls (11x)
- 20 tasks: 21 calls (21x)
- 50 tasks: 51 calls (51x)

### 3. Recommended Workaround

**From post (exact quote)**:
> "Use tasks for status tracking, not knowledge storage. For implementation plans that persist across sessions, stick with markdown files in your repo."

**Pattern**: Hybrid approach
- Tasks API → Status, dependencies, coordination
- Markdown files → Detailed implementation plans, context notes

### 4. Use Case Guidance

**Good use cases** (from post):
- Status tracking across sessions
- User-facing progress displays
- Breaking work into labeled steps

**Poor use cases** (from post):
- Storing implementation plans (description not visible)
- Knowledge storage requiring quick scanning
- Metadata-driven task filtering/sorting

## Gap Analysis

### What the Guide Currently Says

**Section 3.2.2 (Task Management System)**:
- ✅ Documents Tasks API capabilities (persistence, dependencies, status)
- ✅ Shows task schema with `description` and `metadata` fields
- ✅ Recommends use for multi-session projects
- ❌ Does NOT mention field visibility limitations
- ❌ Does NOT document multi-call overhead for accessing descriptions
- ❌ Does NOT warn about metadata invisibility

**Section: Task Management Workflow**:
- ✅ Shows "TaskList to see current state" pattern
- ❌ Does NOT mention TaskList omits descriptions
- ❌ Does NOT show selective TaskGet pattern

**Cheatsheet**:
- ✅ Shows Tasks API commands
- ❌ No mention of field visibility constraints

### What This Resource Adds

1. **Factual constraint**: TaskList field visibility documented
2. **Cost awareness**: Multi-call overhead quantified
3. **Workaround pattern**: Hybrid approach (Tasks + markdown) justified
4. **Use case refinement**: Good/poor uses based on limitation

## Impact Assessment

### If Integrated (Current State)

**User Experience**:
- ✅ Users warned before hitting limitation
- ✅ Workaround patterns provided immediately
- ✅ Cost implications transparent
- ✅ Guide maintains trust ("They told me about the trap")

**Guide Quality**:
- ✅ More complete (critical gap filled)
- ✅ Practitioner-validated (not just theory)
- ✅ Actionable (3 workaround patterns provided)

### If NOT Integrated (Risk Scenario)

**User Frustration** (High Risk):
1. User follows guide: "TaskList to see current state"
2. TaskList shows subjects only, no descriptions
3. User thinks setup is broken: "Why can't I see my task notes?"
4. User discovers limitation independently
5. User loses trust: "The Ultimate Guide didn't mention this?"

**Cost Waste** (Medium Risk):
- Users unknowingly call TaskGet in loops to fetch descriptions
- 11x-51x overhead for routine task review
- No warning about token/cost implications

**Support Burden** (Medium Risk):
- Repeated questions: "Why is TaskList not showing descriptions?"
- GitHub issues, Discord threads, Reddit posts
- Maintainer time spent answering same question

**Competitive Risk** (Low Risk):
- If official Anthropic docs or competing guides document first
- "Why didn't the Ultimate Guide catch this?"

## Technical Writer Challenge (Summary)

**Original evaluation**: 4/5 (High Value), integrate in 7 days

**Challenge findings** (accepted):
1. ✅ Score under-evaluated: Should be 5/5 (breaks workflow + hidden cost)
2. ✅ Extraction incomplete: Missed "metadata NEVER visible" (broader scope)
3. ✅ Integration under-specified: Forgot cheatsheet + reference.yaml
4. ✅ Priority inconsistent: Said "7 days" but risk justifies <24h

**Revisions applied**:
- Score: 4/5 → 5/5 (CRITICAL)
- Scope: "description hidden" → "ALL metadata hidden"
- Files: 3 → 6 (added cheatsheet, YAML, evaluation doc)
- Priority: 7 days → <24h (CRITICAL tier)
- Formulation: Vague → Exact text for each section

---

## Decision Rationale

### Why Integrate Immediately?

1. **High impact**: Affects daily usage of new feature (v2.1.16, launched 5 days ago)
2. **Trust critical**: Early warning prevents frustration, maintains guide credibility
3. **Low effort**: ~100 lines across 6 files, clear workaround patterns available
4. **Practitioner validation**: Source is early adopter with real-world usage (not speculation)
5. **Gap confirmation**: No existing section in guide mentions this limitation

### Why CRITICAL Score?

Passes all 3 tests for critical integration:
1. ✅ **Breaks workflow**: "TaskList → Show all tasks" is silently incomplete
2. ✅ **Hidden cost**: 11x-51x overhead not mentioned anywhere
3. ✅ **Trust damage**: Discovering limitation independently after following guide harms credibility
