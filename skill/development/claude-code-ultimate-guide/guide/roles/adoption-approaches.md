# Choosing Your Adoption Approach

> **Disclaimer**: Claude Code is young (~1 year). Nobody has definitive answers yet — including this guide. These are starting points based on observed patterns, not proven best practices. Adapt heavily to your context.

---

## What We Don't Know Yet

Before diving in, here's what remains genuinely uncertain:

- **Optimal CLAUDE.md size** — Some teams thrive with 10 lines, others with 100. No clear winner.
- **Team adoption patterns** — Whether top-down standardization beats organic adoption is unproven.
- **Context management thresholds** — The 70%/90% numbers are heuristics, not science.
- **ROI of advanced features** — MCP servers, hooks, agents — unclear when the setup cost pays off.

If anyone tells you they've figured this out, they're ahead of the field or overconfident.

## What We Do Know (Empirical Data)

Some patterns have emerged from practitioner studies and team retrospectives:

| Finding | Data | Implication |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Scope matters most** | 1-3 files: ~85% success, 8+ files: ~40% | Start small, expand gradually |
| **CLAUDE.md sweet spot** | 4-8KB optimal, >16K degrades coherence | Concise > comprehensive |
| **Session limits** | 15-25 turns before constraint drift | Reset for new tasks |
| **Script generation ROI** | 70-90% time savings reported | Best first use case |
| **Exploration before implementation** | +20-30% decision quality | Ask for alternatives first |

**Source**: MetalBear engineering blog, arXiv practitioner studies, Reddit engineering threads (2024-2025).

Field reports from engineering teams add qualitative texture to these numbers. At ManoMano (250 engineers, 400+ microservices), Jocelyn N'takpe found that the single highest-leverage investment was maintaining an up-to-date AGENTS.md and a set of rules encoding internal conventions: how to connect to the database, how messages are encoded for Kafka, naming standards. The agent-facing documentation became better maintained than the team's Confluence wiki, because the feedback loop is immediate. Poorly documented conventions produce bad agent output today, not in six months. ([IFTTD ep 346 "IA & DevX"](https://www.ifttd.io/episodes/ia-devx))

Research from ETH Zurich and UC Berkeley (Mündler et al., PLDI 2025, [arXiv 2504.09246](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09246)) found that 94% of compilation errors in LLM-generated code are type errors. The practical implication: strictly typed languages and strict architectural patterns (hexagonal architecture, DDD) act as a safety net for agent-generated code, because the compiler rejects a large class of agent mistakes automatically. N'takpe's team at ManoMano observed this directly: the more structure the codebase imposes, the more consistently agents work within it. ([IFTTD ep 346](https://www.ifttd.io/episodes/ia-devx))

Two practices experienced practitioners recommend maintaining deliberately: alternating AI-assisted and manual coding sessions to preserve deep system understanding (Sébastien Deleuze, Spring Framework committer, [IFTTD ep 349](https://www.ifttd.io/episodes/tech-et-soft-skills)), and capping daily AI development cycles even when tooling makes more cycles technically possible, as cognitive load limits are real and practitioners who ignored them reported significant fatigue within weeks (Julien Lepine, [IFTTD ep 351](https://www.ifttd.io/episodes/aws-summit)).

**AI amplifies a team's existing practices, for better or worse.** A team with weak engineering habits before AI adoption tends to see its anti-patterns get worse, not corrected, once agents enter the workflow. This contradicts the common assumption that AI mechanically raises the floor and spreads good practices on its own. The tool accelerates whatever is already there.

*Geoffrey Graveaud, Dev With AI Meetup, 2026*

---

**A rare and honestly reported failure case.** One team delegated user stories entirely to agents running continuously without supervision, and lost velocity as a result. The problem was not obvious from daily standups; it only surfaced once the team deliberately set out to measure it, rather than through intuition or complaints.

*Samuel Gallet & Geslain Dahan, Dev With AI Meetup, 2026*

---

**Adoption spreads through practice and permission to fail, not a mandated rollout.** Several independent company contexts converge on the same pattern: teams that carve out dedicated experimentation time, an open discovery phase with no imposed guidance first, then a structuring phase to avoid overlapping projects, build genuine adoption faster than teams handed a top-down mandate.

*The Product Crew, enterprise adoption field reports, 2024-2026 (Alan, Payfit, Joko contexts)*

---

**Leadership buy-in is a non-negotiable precondition for an AI transformation to hold.** Without a convinced sponsor at the executive level, the initiative loses momentum once the initial enthusiasm fades.

## Starting Points (Not Prescriptions)

| Your Context | One Approach to Try |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Limited setup time | **Turnkey** — minimal config, iterate based on friction |
| Solo developer | **Autonomous** — learn concepts first, configure when needed |
| Small team (4-10) | **Hybrid** — shared basics + room for personal preferences |
| Larger team (10+) | **Turnkey + docs** — consistency matters more at scale |

These are hypotheses. Your mileage will vary.

---

## Decision Tree

```
Starting Claude Code?
│
├─ Need to ship today?
│   └─ YES → Turnkey Quickstart
│   └─ NO ↓
│
├─ Team needs shared conventions?
│   └─ YES → Turnkey + document what matters to you
│   └─ NO ↓
│
├─ Want to understand before configuring?
│   └─ YES → Autonomous Learning Path
│   └─ NO → Turnkey, adjust as you go
```

---

## Turnkey Quickstart

### Step 1: Create Minimal Config

```bash
mkdir -p .claude
```

Create `.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
# Project: [your-project-name]

## Stack
- Runtime: [Node 20 / Python 3.11 / etc.]
- Framework: [Next.js / FastAPI / etc.]

## Commands
- Test: `npm test` or `pytest`
- Lint: `npm run lint` or `ruff check`

## Convention
- [One rule you care most about, e.g., "TypeScript strict mode required"]
```

### Step 2: Verify Setup

```bash
claude
```

Then ask:
```
What's this project's test command?
```

**Pass**: Returns your configured command.
**Fail**: CLAUDE.md not loaded — check path is `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `./CLAUDE.md`

### Step 3: First Real Task

```bash
claude "Review the README and suggest improvements"
```

Claude should reference your stack and conventions automatically.

**Done.** Add more config only when you hit friction.

---

## Autonomous Learning Path

If you prefer understanding before configuring, here's a progressive approach. No time estimates — speed depends on your familiarity with AI tools.

### Phase 1: Mental Model

**Goal**: Understand how Claude Code operates before adding config.

1. Read [Section 5: Mental Model](../ultimate-guide.md) (line 1675)
2. Core concept: Claude works in a loop — prompt → plan → execute → verify
3. **Try it**: Complete a few real tasks with zero config. Notice where friction appears.

### Phase 2: Context Management

**Goal**: Understand the main constraint of the tool.

1. Read [Context Management](../ultimate-guide.md) (line 944)
2. The general idea (exact thresholds vary by use case):
   - Low usage: work freely
   - Medium usage: be more selective
   - High usage: consider `/compact`
   - Near limit: `/clear` to reset
3. **Try it**: Check `/status` periodically. See how your usage patterns develop.

### Phase 3: Memory Files

**Goal**: Give Claude project context.

1. Read [Memory Files](../ultimate-guide.md) (line 2218)
2. Precedence: project `.claude/CLAUDE.md` > global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
3. **Try it**: Create a minimal CLAUDE.md, test if Claude picks it up.

### Phase 4: Extensions (when friction appears)

Add complexity only when you hit real problems:

| Friction | Possible Solution | Reference |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Repeating same task often | Consider an agent | [Agent Template](../ultimate-guide.md) line 2793 |
| Security concern | Consider a hook | [Hook Templates](../ultimate-guide.md) line 4172 |
| Need external tool access | Consider MCP | [MCP Config](../ultimate-guide.md) line 4771 |
| AI repeats same mistake | Add a specific rule | Start with one line, not ten |

Whether these solutions are worth the setup cost depends on your context.

---

## Sanity Checks

These are signals that things are working, not rigid milestones.

### Basic Setup Works

```bash
claude --version          # Responds with version
claude /status            # Shows context info
claude /mcp               # Lists MCP servers (may be empty)
```

If these fail: installation issue — try `claude doctor`.

### Config Is Being Read

**Test**: Ask Claude "What's the test command for this project?"

If it returns your configured command, CLAUDE.md is loaded. If not, check the path.

### You're Managing Context

**Signal**: You've noticed when context gets high and acted on it.

This develops naturally with use. If you never think about context, either you're not using Claude intensively, or you're ignoring signals that might matter.

### Extensions Feel Useful (or not needed)

**Signal**: You've either created something (agent, hook, command) that helps, or you haven't needed to.

Both are fine. Extensions are optional — don't add them just to have them.

---

## Common Pitfalls

These patterns seem problematic based on observations, though individual experiences vary.

| Pattern | What happens | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Large copied config** | Rules get ignored, unclear what matters | Start small, add based on friction |
| **Over-engineering setup** | Time spent configuring instead of coding | Use templates as starting point |
| **No shared conventions** | Team members diverge, onboarding confusion | Document a few essentials |
| **Everything enabled immediately** | Complexity without clear benefit | Enable features when you need them |

These aren't universal truths — some teams thrive with large configs or full feature sets.

---

## Team Size Considerations

These are starting points, not rules. Team dynamics matter more than headcount.

### Solo / Small Team (2-3)

**Typical structure**:
```
./CLAUDE.md                    # Project basics, committed
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md            # Personal preferences
```

**What might work**:
- Short project CLAUDE.md with stack and main commands
- Personal config for model preferences, flags
- Extensions only if you find yourself repeating tasks often

**Watch for**: Over-engineering. If you're spending more time on config than coding, step back.

### Medium Team (4-10)

**Typical structure**:
```
./CLAUDE.md                    # Team conventions (committed)
./.claude/settings.json        # Shared hooks (committed)
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md            # Individual preferences (not committed)
```

**What might work**:
- Shared conventions that the team actually follows
- Security hooks if relevant to your context
- Room for personal preferences

**One way to split things**:

| Shared (repo) | Personal (~/.claude) |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Test/lint commands | Model preferences |
| Project conventions | Custom agents |
| Commit format | Flag defaults |

**Production teams**: Implement [Production Safety Rules](../security/production-safety.md) for port/DB/infrastructure protection via hooks and permission deny rules.

**Watch for**: Conventions that exist on paper but aren't followed.

### Larger Team (10+)

**Typical structure**:
```
./CLAUDE.md                    # Documented, committed
./.claude/settings.json        # Standard hooks, committed
./.claude/agents/              # Shared agents, committed
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md            # Personal additions
```

**What might work**:
- Documented conventions with rationale
- Standardized hooks across the team
- Onboarding that covers basics like `/status`
- **Production teams**: Enforce [Production Safety Rules](../security/production-safety.md) via hooks and permission deny rules

**Watch for**: Config drift. Without some coordination, setups diverge over time. Whether that matters depends on your team.

> **Emerging approach**: Some organizations explore "corporate AI marketplaces" to pool AI skills, agents, and rules at the organizational level rather than individual teams (Hugo/Writizzy 2026[^hugo2026]). Few documented production implementations yet, but the concept addresses governance at scale.

### Enterprise Rollout (50+ developers or regulated environments)

At this scale, individual team setups are not enough. You need a shared config baseline that applies consistently across all projects.

**Phased rollout approach:**

**Phase 1 — Foundation (Week 1–2)**: Establish the governance baseline.
- Create org-level shared config repo (`.claude/` templates per tier)
- Publish AI Usage Charter (see [charter template](../../examples/scripts/ai-usage-charter-template.md))
- Start MCP registry with currently-used MCPs (even if just 3 entries)
- Install global safety hooks on all developer machines via onboarding script

**Phase 2 — Adoption (Week 3–6)**: Roll out project configs.
- Classify existing projects by tier (Starter / Standard / Strict / Regulated)
- Bootstrap each project with the appropriate tier config via setup script
- Add Claude Code onboarding to engineering onboarding checklist
- Run first governance audit to baseline the current state

**Phase 3 — Optimization (Month 2–3)**: Refine based on friction.
- Review hook false positive rate — tune rules that block legitimate work
- Identify MCP requests and process them through registry workflow
- Add CI/CD governance gates to catch config drift
- Conduct first quarterly MCP registry review

**Common rollout mistakes at this scale:**

| Mistake | Effect | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Rolling out Strict tier everywhere on day 1 | Developer resistance, workarounds | Start with Standard, move critical projects to Strict |
| No central config repo | Every team diverges within weeks | Platform team owns shared templates |
| Governance checks that block work | Developers disable hooks | Warn-only hooks, fix the root cause |
| No onboarding → charter ignored | Policy exists on paper only | 30-min onboarding session per team |

**For formal compliance programs** (SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA), the additional requirements around audit trails, data classification, and review cycles are covered in [Enterprise AI Governance](../security/enterprise-governance.md).

## Common Situations

### "I'm evaluating Claude Code for my team"

**Quick test approach**:
1. Install: `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. Run in an existing project: `claude`
3. Try a real task: `claude "Analyze this codebase architecture"`
4. Check `/status` to understand token usage

**Questions to answer**:
- Does Claude understand your stack without config?
- Does a minimal CLAUDE.md improve results?
- Can your team learn context management basics?

Consider skipping advanced features (MCP, hooks, agents) during initial evaluation.

### "My team disagrees on configuration"

**One way to think about it**:

| Layer | Typical owner | Typical content |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Repo CLAUDE.md | Team decision | Stack, commands, core conventions |
| Repo hooks | Security-minded team members | Guardrails if needed |
| Personal ~/.claude | Individual | Preferences, personal agents |

How you resolve conflicts depends on your team culture. Some teams vote, some defer to tech leads, some let individuals diverge.

### "Claude keeps making the same mistake"

**Tempting**: Add many rules to prevent it.

**Often better**: Add one specific rule, test if it works, iterate.

```markdown
## [Specific issue]
When doing [X], avoid [specific mistake].
Instead: [correct approach]
```

If the rule doesn't help, it might be too vague. Make it more specific or reconsider if rules are the right solution.

### "I inherited a large CLAUDE.md"

**One approach**:
1. Ask Claude to summarize what the CLAUDE.md says
2. Compare to what the team actually does
3. Remove rules that aren't followed or referenced
4. Keep what's genuinely useful

**Heuristic**: If you can't explain why a rule exists, consider removing it.

### "When should I add more complexity?"

There's no universal answer. Some signals that might suggest it:

| Signal | Possible response |
|--------|-------------------|
| Repeating the same prompt often | Consider a command |
| Security concern | Consider a hook |
| Need external tool access | Consider MCP |
| Same questions from team | Consider documentation |

But also: maybe you don't need more complexity. Simple setups work for many teams.

## The L0-L5 Scale: Where Is Your Team?

Dan Shapiro (CEO Glowforge) published this framework in January 2026, drawing an explicit parallel with the SAE autonomy levels for self-driving vehicles. The original publication is at [factorydark.com](https://factorydark.com). Simon Willison summarized it at [simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/28/the-five-levels](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/28/the-five-levels/). The name "Five Levels" covers L0-L5 (six levels total).

| Level | Label | What happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| L0 | Spicy Autocomplete | Code completion only. AI never sees your project context. GitHub Copilot used as a fast typist. |
| L1 | Assistant | Chat-driven development. The developer queries AI for specific sub-tasks and pastes the result. No persistent context, no agentic loop. |
| L2 | Agent-in-the-Loop | AI reads the codebase and executes multi-step tasks (Claude Code in basic use). Developer reviews each significant step. This is where most professional use sits today. |
| L3 | Orchestrated Agents | Multiple agents run in parallel or sequence. Spec-driven workflows, harness infrastructure, systematic context management. Significant setup investment required. |
| L4 | Semi-autonomous Factory | Agents complete features with minimal check-ins. Human involvement is specification and review, not implementation. Limited documented production examples. |
| L5 | Dark Factory | Fully autonomous operation. Glowforge reported examples, but no published methodology with independent verification. No proven playbook for reaching this level in general-purpose software. |

**Where real adoption sits in May 2026:** Stack Overflow 2025 survey (n=49,000+) records 84% of developers using or planning to use AI tools. JetBrains AI Pulse January 2026 (n=10,000+) shows 90%. But 77% say "vibe coding" is not part of their professional work, and only 31% use agents at all. A rough mapping: L0-L1 covers roughly 30-40% of developers, L2 accounts for 40-50%, L3 and above is under 10%.

### The J-curve you will hit at L2→L3

Moving from L2 to L3 requires investing in specs, context management, harness infrastructure, and team discipline before the productivity gains materialize. McElheran, Yang, Kroff, and Brynjolfsson (2025) studied this pattern across tens of thousands of US manufacturing plants using Census Bureau data: early AI adopters showed an average -1.33 point drop in total factor productivity before gains emerged. Younger organizations absorbed the transition faster than established ones. The J-curve is a structural feature of General Purpose Technology adoption, not a sign that something went wrong.

**The METR calibration:** The only published RCT on AI developer productivity (METR, July 2025, n=16 experienced developers, 246 real tasks on mature open-source repos) measured a +19% slowdown when developers used AI, while those same developers believed they were 20% faster before the study and still believed they were 20% faster after finishing. The 39-point perception gap is not noise; it is a documented structural bias in self-assessment. METR's study covered developers operating primarily at L1-L2 with Cursor Pro and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. It does not say L3 is useless; it says that the L1-L2 layer is not delivering the claimed gains for experienced developers working on complex existing codebases.

A 2026 update (metr.org/blog/2026-02-24-uplift-update/) attempted a broader follow-up (n=57, 800+ tasks). The study was abandoned: 30-50% of participants refused to work without AI, making the non-AI condition unmeasurable. Partial data from the 10 developers common to both studies showed results consistent with Study 1. Across newer participants, the gap narrowed toward -4% (IC -15% to +9%), and some subgroups showed improvement of up to +18 percentage points relative to Study 1's baseline. METR qualifies this partial data as "very weak evidence." The practical takeaway: outcome depends heavily on developer profile, task complexity, and model version. No published RCT has yet documented a net productivity gain for experienced developers on complex production codebases, but the magnitude of the effect appears to vary considerably across contexts.

**DeputyDev enterprise cohort:** arXiv 2509.19708 tracked 300 engineers over 12 months (September 2024 to August 2025) with statistical controls on PR cycle time. Adoption curve: 4% in month 1, 83% by month 6, then stabilization at around 60% sustained use. A 31.8% reduction in PR cycle time (p=0.0018). This is observational, not a RCT, but it is the best longitudinal data available on team-level adoption.

**What this means for your team:** Self-reported productivity gains in the 20-64% range that circulate from McKinsey, BCG, and GitHub's own studies are not replicated in controlled conditions. Use them as motivation, not as targets. The realistic trajectory follows the J-curve: a slowdown during transition, then sustained gains for teams who invest in the L3 infrastructure. The teams that skip the investment and stay at L2 rarely see the large efficiency claims materialize.

### Level-specific guidance

| Level | First investment that unlocks the next level |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| L0 → L1 | Add CLAUDE.md with project context. One hour. |
| L1 → L2 | Install Claude Code. Run real tasks on real code with `/plan` and `/compact`. Two to three days of practice. |
| L2 → L3 | Write structured specs before implementation. Learn context engineering basics. Commit to the L0→L5 maturity model. Weeks to months. |
| L3 → L4 | Build or adopt a harness: while-loop engine, tool registry, session persistence, lifecycle hooks. Requires dedicated engineering time. |
| L4 → L5 | No proven general playbook exists as of May 2026. Early examples are domain-specific. |

| Model  | Cost | Typical use cases              |
|--------|------|--------------------------------|
| Haiku  | $    | Simple tasks, quick responses  |
| Sonnet | $$   | General development            |
| Opus   | $$$  | Complex analysis, architecture |

Most people start with Sonnet. Adjust based on your experience.
