# TDD with Claude Code

> **Confidence**: Tier 1 — Based on official Anthropic best practices and extensive community validation.

Test-Driven Development with Claude requires explicit prompting. Claude naturally writes implementation first, then tests. TDD requires the inverse.

## TL;DR

```
Red → Green → Refactor

But you MUST prompt Claude explicitly:
"Write a FAILING test for [feature]. Do NOT write implementation yet."
```

---

## The Problem

Without explicit instruction, Claude will:
1. Write implementation code
2. Then write tests that pass against that implementation

This defeats TDD's purpose: tests should drive design, not validate existing code.

---

## Setup

### CLAUDE.md Configuration

Add to your project's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Testing Conventions

### TDD Workflow
- Always write failing tests BEFORE implementation
- Use AAA pattern: Arrange-Act-Assert
- One assertion per test when possible
- Test names describe behavior: "should_return_empty_when_no_items"

### Test-First Rules
- When I ask for a feature, write tests first
- Tests should FAIL initially (no implementation exists)
- Only after tests are written, implement minimal code to pass
```

### Hook for Auto-Run Tests (Optional)

Create `.claude/hooks/test-on-save.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-run tests when test files change
if [[ "$1" == *test* ]] || [[ "$1" == *spec* ]]; then
  npm test --watchAll=false 2>&1 | head -20
fi
```

## The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

### Phase 1: Red (Write Failing Test)

**Prompt**:
```
Write a failing test for [feature description].
Do NOT write the implementation yet.
The test should fail because the function/method doesn't exist.
```

**Example**:
```
Write a failing test for a function that calculates the total price
of items in a cart, applying a 10% discount if total exceeds $100.
Do NOT implement the function yet.
```

**Expected Claude behavior**:
- Creates test file with test cases
- Tests reference function that doesn't exist
- Running tests would fail with "function not defined" or similar

**Verification**:
```bash
npm test  # Should fail with "calculateCartTotal is not defined"
```

### Phase 2: Green (Minimal Implementation)

**Prompt**:
```
Now implement the minimum code to make these tests pass.
Only write enough code to pass the current tests, nothing more.
```

**Expected Claude behavior**:
- Creates implementation file
- Writes minimal code to satisfy tests
- Avoids over-engineering

**Verification**:
```bash
npm test  # Should pass
```

### Phase 3: Refactor (Clean Up)

**Prompt**:
```
Refactor the implementation to improve code quality.
Tests must stay green after refactoring.
Focus on: [readability / performance / removing duplication]
```

**Expected Claude behavior**:
- Improves code without changing behavior
- Runs tests to verify they still pass
- Documents any significant changes

## Integration with Claude Code Features

### With TodoWrite

Track TDD phases in your task list:

```
User: "Implement user authentication with TDD"

Claude creates todos:
- [ ] RED: Write failing tests for login
- [ ] GREEN: Implement login to pass tests
- [ ] REFACTOR: Clean up login implementation
- [ ] RED: Write failing tests for logout
- [ ] GREEN: Implement logout
- [ ] REFACTOR: Clean up
```

### With Plan Mode

Use planning for test strategy:

```
[Press Shift+Tab to enter Plan Mode]

I need to implement a shopping cart with TDD.
Plan the test cases before we start writing any code.
```

Claude will explore codebase in read-only mode, then propose test plan before any implementation.

### With Hooks

Auto-run tests after edits using a PostToolUse hook:

```json
// In .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npm test --watchAll=false 2>&1 | head -20"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### With Sub-Agents

Delegate test writing to scope-focused agent:

```
Use the test-writer agent to create comprehensive tests for
the UserService class, covering all edge cases.
Then I'll implement to pass those tests.
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

### The Verification Gap

The Verification Gap is the failure mode where an agent reports a feature complete before the verification suite confirms it. It is the most common reliability failure in multi-session agent work, and it is entirely preventable with the right harness design.

Three observable symptoms: the agent prints a success message before any test command runs; tests run but stderr is discarded or not read; only unit tests pass when the acceptance criteria specified end-to-end behavior.

The fix is a three-layer verification stack that must all pass before any feature is marked `passing` in the feature list:

1. **Lint** — syntax and style checks (fastest, catches obvious errors before running tests)
2. **Unit and integration tests** — functional correctness of individual components
3. **End-to-end tests** — behavioral contract as seen by a user or external caller

Each layer catches a different class of failure. Unit tests can pass while component boundaries break. End-to-end tests surface state propagation errors and lifecycle issues that unit tests cannot see. Skipping any layer leaves a gap.

The independent evaluator principle: the agent that writes the code must not be the same invocation that certifies it done. This is not about distrust of the model; it is about how context affects evaluation. An agent that just spent two hours building a feature interprets ambiguous output charitably. A PostToolUse hook or a second agent reading the exit code independently does not. The hook in `examples/hooks/bash/verification-gate.sh` implements this pattern.

Anthropic documented this failure in their harness design research: in a bare run (no harness), their agent reported the game editor complete after 20 minutes. Nothing worked. With an independent evaluator added to the harness, the same model ran for 6 hours and delivered a functional result. (Source: [https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps))

The WIP=1 rule connects here: keeping only one feature `active` at a time means the verification gap, when it occurs, affects one feature, not several simultaneously.

### What NOT to do

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| "Write tests for this feature" | Claude implements first | "Write FAILING tests that don't exist yet" |
| "Add tests and implementation" | Loses test-first benefit | Separate into two prompts |
| "Make sure tests pass" | Encourages implementation-first | "Write tests, then implement minimally" |
| Skipping refactor phase | Accumulates technical debt | Always refactor after green |
| Multiple features at once | Loses focus | One feature per TDD cycle |

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake**: Asking Claude to "test" existing code.
```
# Wrong
"Write tests for the existing calculateTotal function"

# Right
"Write tests for calculateTotal behavior, assuming function doesn't exist.
Then we'll verify the existing implementation passes."
```

**Mistake**: Combining red and green phases.
```
# Wrong
"Implement calculateTotal with tests"

# Right
"Write failing tests for calculateTotal. Stop there."
[After tests written]
"Now implement to pass those tests."
```

---

## Advanced Patterns

### Property-Based Testing

```
Write property-based tests for the sort function.
Properties to test:
- Output length equals input length
- All input elements exist in output
- Output is ordered
Use fast-check or similar library.
```

### Mutation Testing

```
After tests pass, run mutation testing to find weak spots.
Identify tests that don't catch mutations.
```

> **Going further**: JiTTesting applies mutation testing automatically at PR time — LLM-generated, ephemeral, zero maintenance. Meta deployed this at scale with 4x regression catch improvement over traditional tests. See [Just-in-Time Catching Test Generation at Meta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22832) and the [methodologies guide](../core/methodologies.md#jittesting-just-in-time-testing) for the approximation pattern with Claude Code today.

### TDD with Legacy Code

```
I need to refactor legacyFunction.
First, write characterization tests that capture current behavior.
Then we'll refactor with confidence.
```

## Example Session

### User Request
```
Implement a URL shortener service with TDD.
```

### Phase 1: Red
```
Let's use TDD. First, write failing tests for:
1. Shortening a URL returns a short code
2. Retrieving a short code returns original URL
3. Invalid URLs are rejected
4. Expired links return error

Do NOT implement anything yet.
```

### Phase 2: Green
```
Tests are written and failing. Now implement the minimum
code to make them pass. Use an in-memory store for now.
```

### Phase 3: Refactor
```
Tests pass. Now refactor:
- Extract URL validation to separate function
- Add proper error types
- Improve variable names

Run tests after each change to ensure they stay green.
```
