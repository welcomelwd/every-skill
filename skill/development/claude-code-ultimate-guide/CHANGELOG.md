## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- **Resource evaluation: Multi-Project Agent Network** (`docs/resource-evaluations/grenier-multi-project-agent-network.md`, index row added in `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): scored 3/5, partial integration. Field report by Mathieu Grenier (CTO, Easystrat) on moving an agentic network from one project to five or six, built on the Pi harness with a unix-socket message bus between orchestrators. Two patterns are worth carrying into `guide/workflows/agent-teams.md` §Advanced Orchestration Patterns and are absent from the guide today: the **steering rule** (redirect an agent that is drifting, never one that is progressing, with the counter-example of a steer that cost ~10 minutes of message-answering on a healthy runner) and the **single-writer pattern for shared plan files** (a read-only agent requests the write over the bus, the orchestrator performs it, eliminating write conflicts). The article's central claim, that inter-orchestrator messaging and multi-repo orchestration are undocumented, is rejected with evidence: Claude Code agent teams already ship peer-to-peer mailbox messaging (`guide/workflows/agent-teams.md:207-219`, documented since the 2026-02-09 Addy Osmani correction), Gas Town and ComposioHQ's agent-orchestrator both treat multi-repo as the base unit, Hermes' GEPA loop already auto-improves its own tooling (`guide/ecosystem/agentic-tools.md:121-142`), and the "coordinator that does no domain work" constraint is stated verbatim in the guide's existing Hub-and-Spoke pattern (`guide/workflows/agent-teams.md:1526`). The gap traces to the article's source set (LangGraph 2024, AutoGen, metaswarm and Microsoft A2A), which predates the 2026 coding-agent orchestrator wave. Three technical blind spots are recorded: a fault-tolerant messaging layer rebuilt from scratch (TTL, acks, idempotency cache, dead-receiver detection, hop limit) where NATS or Redis Streams would supply it, no cost figure disclosed for a mesh the guide already prices at 3x or more in tokens, and a hop limit that bounds chain length without detecting cycles. Also flags a name collision: the author is not the same person as the "Mathieu Grenier" credited in `grenier-agent-skill-quality.md` (2026-02-07), whose attribution needs its own re-verification.
- **New section: The Attention Cost of the Review Shift** (`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`, +7 `deep_dive` keys in `machine-readable/reference.yaml` and `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`, cross-refs added in `guide/roles/adoption-approaches.md` and `guide/ops/team-metrics.md`): the guide already documented that the review bottleneck has inverted and that heavy AI users spend 14-16h/week reviewing. It did not document what that costs the person reviewing. New §14 covers four things. First, review has ceilings measured before AI existed and unchanged since: the Cisco/SmartBear study (Cohen 2006, ~50 developers, ~2,500 reviews, 3.2M LOC) puts effective review under 200 LOC, under 300 LOC/hour, with detection collapsing past 60-90 minutes, backed by fMRI work on comprehension load (Siegmund ICSE 2014, Floyd ICSE 2017, Peitek 2021). Second, reviewing machine output is a distinct failure mode: Goddard et al. 2011 measured ~26% higher incorrect-decision risk when following erroneous automated advice, and Lee/Sarkar et al. (CHI 2025, Microsoft Research and CMU, 319 knowledge workers) found confidence in GenAI inversely predicts critical thinking. Third, the recovery angle: BCG and UC Riverside (n=1,488) report 14% "AI brain fry" overall and 18% among developers, set against the detachment meta-analysis (Wendsche & Lohmann-Haislah 2017, N=38,124) and a counterweight finding that low detachment paired with autonomous motivation predicts *lower* exhaustion. Fourth, the junior pipeline: Stanford "Canaries in the Coal Mine" (~16% relative employment decline, ages 22-25), Westby et al. (16.3% drop in junior posting share), Harvard AI-adopter cohort data. A closing subsection states explicitly what the evidence does *not* support, including the untested claim that reduced friction drives overwork.
- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.223** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`, landing `src/data/releases.ts`, `mcp-server/content/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `mcp-server/package.json` 1.2.7 → 1.2.8): three releases condensed, v2.1.221 (2026-08-03) through v2.1.223 (2026-08-05). v2.1.221 closed two permission-check bypasses (zsh executing hidden commands inside `[[ ]]` regex conditionals in the Bash tool, PowerShell mishandling quoted paths on Windows, both now prompting for approval), added a `mode: "mask"` option for sandbox credential files on Linux/WSL so a sandboxed command reads a sentinel value while the sandbox proxy substitutes the real one on egress, and a VSCode Focus view collapsing tool activity behind a per-turn summary; background sessions now commit and push automatically, open a draft PR only when the task calls for one, and follow the repository's CLAUDE.md git instructions. v2.1.222 fixed worktree-isolated sessions being able to run destructive git commands against the main checkout (isolation now covers file edits and Bash in every session type), fixed PreToolUse auto-allow hooks bypassing tool restrictions in background agent tasks, locked Remote Control auto-start to user scope (repo-local settings can no longer turn it on), and removed the ultraplan feature. v2.1.223 closed three more permission-check bypasses (a crafted command hiding parts of itself from approval, tab/invisible-Unicode padding hiding command text, workflow scripts escaping the sandbox via dynamic `import()`), merged `/review` into `/code-review` as an alias, and added owner wildcard entries (`"owner/*"`) to marketplace allow/block lists. MCP server rebuilt (`npm run build`) after the content resync.
- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.232** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`, landing `src/data/releases.ts`, `mcp-server/content/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `mcp-server/package.json` 1.2.8 → 1.2.9): eight releases condensed, v2.1.224 (2026-08-07) through v2.1.232 (2026-08-13). Anthropic skipped 2.1.230, so the sequence has a hole and that is not an omission here. Two of the eight carry real features, the rest are fixes. v2.1.224 shipped self-hosted environments (`claude self-hosted-runner` turns your own machines or containers into where Claude Code web, mobile, and desktop sessions run, Team and Enterprise only) and cross-session `SendMessage`, which lets sessions on any of your machines message each other with `ListAgents` to find them, on macOS and Linux. It also added an `archive` plugin source installing from a zip over HTTPS with optional SHA-256 pinning, the `crossSessionInbound` and `dialogExpiry` settings, sandbox credential-masking options (`extract`, `decode: "jwt"` with `maskClaims`, `awsPairs`/`sigv4`), fixed long project paths resolving into another project's session directory, fixed sandbox deny entries written with a trailing slash being silently bypassable, and removed the 200-subagent-per-session spawn cap. The same release widened what the `/feedback` transcript share uploads: with consent it now also sends the last request's system prompt, which carries your `CLAUDE.md` instructions, plus tool definitions and model parameters. v2.1.232 turned subagent forking on by default, so a `subagent_type: "fork"` subagent inherits the full conversation and prompt cache and non-teammate spawns run in the background, added `@` to mention another session by name, brought GitLab into plugin marketplaces with matching token redaction for the nine GitLab token families, and closed three permission bypasses (PowerShell overwriting `$PSDefaultParameterValues`, Windows Git Bash following Cygwin-style symlinks, nested git repositories inheriting trust from a parent). Between them: v2.1.225 gateway spend limits and `SendMessage` to Remote Control sessions on other machines, v2.1.227 a Fable usage-credits prompt fired at Max users on an expired token, v2.1.228 hardening of claude.ai-synced skills plus a Write tool rule change letting newer models overwrite an unread file, v2.1.229 plugin marketplace `command` sources and `/commit-push-pr` no longer auto-approving `--force`/`--amend`/`--no-verify`, v2.1.231 a single MCP OAuth redirect-URI fix for pre-registered clients such as Slack. Six entries added to `breaking_summary`, two milestones (2.1.224, 2.1.232), MCP server rebuilt after the content resync. RSS untouched: landing entries for CC releases are generated from `releases.ts`.
- **Cheatsheet caught up with v2.1.224 and v2.1.232** (`guide/cheatsheet.md`): four additions, all daily-driver material the release tracking alone would not surface. `@session-name` joins the File References block, since mentioning another live session is prompt syntax and belongs next to `@file` and `@agent-name`. Two rows in Features Méconnues: cross-session messaging (`ListAgents` to discover, `SendMessage` to talk, macOS and Linux) and self-hosted environments (Team and Enterprise). `claude self-hosted-runner` added to Key CLI Subcommands with the Windows `--base-dir` requirement noted, because that one fails at startup rather than degrading. The Background Agents row now states that forking is the default since v2.1.232, which changes what a spawned agent inherits.
- **Threat database updated to v2.25.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`, `guide/security/security-hardening.md`): 4 Perplexity searches against the July 12 to August 6, 2026 window, cross-checked line by line against the existing database to drop duplicates already covered by the July 12 update (Friendly Fire, DuneSlide, GhostApproval, GuardFall, the Claude Code GitHub Action `/proc/self/environ` exfiltration, and NVIDIA SkillSpector all came back as "new" from search but were already tracked). Five new CVEs: three in the MCP Python SDK (`CVE-2026-59950` WebSocket Host/Origin bypass fixed in 1.28.1, `CVE-2026-52869` and `CVE-2026-52870` session/task cross-client exposure fixed in 1.27.2), Cursor `CVE-2026-48124` (workspace hook config running outside the sandbox, fixed in 3.0.0, part of Pillar Security's "Week of Sandbox Escapes" series also naming Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity), and AstrBot `CVE-2026-15501` (SSRF via an unvalidated MCP test-endpoint URL parameter, fix version unconfirmed in public advisories, marked as such rather than guessed). One new attack technique, T038 HalluSquatting (attackers pre-register the exact hallucinated package names an AI coding agent tends to invent, tested vulnerable against Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, NanoClaw, Windsurf, and Cursor). Five new defensive entries: `mcp-spec-check` and SkillDetonate as scanning tools, Destructive Command Guard, SingGuard-NSFA, and JetStream Verified MCP as defensive resources. `minimum_safe_versions` bumped for `mcp-python-sdk` (1.23.0 → 1.28.1) and corrected for `cursor` (the existing 1.3.9 floor predated DuneSlide and GhostApproval, both of which require >= 3.0.0). The two highest-impact new CVEs (MCP Python SDK auth bypass, Cursor sandbox escape) mirrored into the security-hardening CVE table. 10 new sources. YAML validated.

- **Threat database updated to v2.26.0 and a new guide section on startup-hook persistence** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`, `guide/security/security-hardening.md` new §1.6, `examples/scripts/supply-chain-triage.py`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`): the Shai-Hulud keyv/cacheable npm worm of 2026-08-04, cross-checked across eight vendor reports (SafeDep, Aikido, Chainguard, Snyk, JFrog, ArmorCode, Socket, The Hacker News) rather than taken from any single one, because their counts disagree and the disagreement is itself the finding. Three corrections to what circulated publicly: the `@keyv/*` storage adapters ARE compromised at `6.0.0` (JFrog's affected-package table and SafeDep's CSV both list them, contradicting an early report that they stayed clean); the named `gh-token-monitor` file paths come from Snyk's TanStack analysis of 2026-05-11 and are NOT confirmed in a keyv sample, so their absence proves nothing; and Aikido's live figure is 444 packages across 1,381 versions as of 2026-08-05 13:15 CEST. Counts are recorded per source with their timestamps instead of collapsed into one number. New campaign entry covering the provenance abuse (malicious releases carry valid OIDC and SLSA attestations because the maintainer's own GitHub Actions workflow published them, so `npm audit signatures` passes; Chainguard calls it the first documented npm worm producing validly attested malicious packages), 17 confirmed `package@version` pairs, three full SHA-256 payload hashes, `npm-cache.com` plus `pypi-get.com` and `js-mirror.com` as egress to block, and a remediation order that puts persistence removal before credential rotation because the payload ships a watcher that fires ON revocation. Two new attack techniques: T039 Agent Config Persistence (`SessionStart`, `Setup`, `InstructionsLoaded`, `DirectoryAdded`, and VS Code `runOn: folderOpen`, linked to `CVE-2026-48124`, `CVE-2026-25725`, `CVE-2026-33068`) and T040 AI Agent Commit Impersonation. The guide's §1.5 previously covered only `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` hooks, which need agent activity to fire; §1.6 covers the four events that fire on folder open, before any prompt, which is why attackers use them for persistence, and states the blunt consequence that `git clone` plus opening the folder is enough to execute attacker code with every package-manager defence sitting on a path the attack never takes. T040 documents the part with no prior analog: the worm commits as `claude <claude@users.noreply.github.com>` with the message `chore: update config` across up to 50 branches per repo, skipping `dependabot` and `copilot`, so on a repository where an agent already commits, authorship stops discriminating and branch fan-out becomes the signal. 8 new sources. YAML validated, 605/605 index anchors resolve.
- **A supply chain triage script, validated against a synthetic positive control rather than only a clean machine** (`examples/scripts/supply-chain-triage.py`): checks lockfiles (parsed per format, since npm writes name and version on separate lines and a proximity regex either misses the pair or, widened enough to catch it, starts pairing a name with the neighbouring entry's version), the installed tree, payload hashes, agent and editor startup hooks, revocation watchers, and egress config, in incident-response order. Reads its IOC set from `threat-db.yaml` instead of hardcoding one, with a built-in fallback so it still runs on a quarantined machine with no PyYAML. Two bugs were caught by the positive control and would have shipped without it: an initial dropper pattern matching `install.js` and `postinstall` flagged esbuild's entirely legitimate `"postinstall": "node install.js"`, and the first lockfile matcher missed `keyv@6.0.0` in a real `package-lock.json`. Deliberately not a filename scan, and the docstring says why: `Math_Symbol.js` is a genuine Unicode category file inside `regenerate-unicode-properties` and `setup.mjs` ships legitimately in `motion-dom`, so the attacker picked names that collide with common transitive dependencies. Measured on this workstation, a filename sweep across 152,491 installed `package.json` files returned 32 hits, all benign, while the `preinstall` check returned zero. Full run 5m42s, `--fast` 1m43s, same verdict.
- **Index pointer corrected: `security_threat_db` was aimed at a stale fork** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`): the key resolved to `examples/skills/update-threat-db/threat-db.yaml`, last updated at v2.18.0 on 2026-05-16 and never touched since its "copy threat-db" commit, while the actively maintained file is `examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml` (now v2.26.0). Repository-wide, 8 references point at the stale copy and 12 at the canonical one, so any skill reading the former runs on eight-versions-old intel. The key now resolves to the canonical file, the stale copy is indexed separately and labelled, and the de-duplication itself is tracked in `IDEAS.md`.

### Added

- **Team Metrics closed a 2026 tooling-market gap and gained a board-reporting playbook** (`guide/ops/team-metrics.md`, `whitepapers/en/11-team-metrics.qmd`, `whitepapers/fr/11-team-metrics.qmd`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`): fresh research against the current delivery-intelligence market found the existing Tooling table covered only half the active field. Added "Broader Delivery Intelligence Platforms" (DX, Multitudes, Swarmia, Cortex.io, Jellyfish, Oobeya, Hatica, the last flagged explicitly as thinner on documented specifics than the rest) and "AI-Generated Board Narratives" (LinearB's AI iteration summary, Jellyfish's "AI Executive Report," both framed as explanation of already-computed metrics rather than new analysis) as new Tooling subsections. Cortex.io and Jellyfish were already cited elsewhere in the guide as data sources for PR-size and change-failure-rate figures; this documents them as tools in their own right for the first time. A new top-level "Probabilistic Delivery Forecasting" section covers ActionableAgile and Nave's Monte Carlo simulation, including Nave's load-bearing quote that the sole requirement for reliable Monte Carlo forecasts is a predictable delivery system, and states plainly that the technique replicates an unstable system's unpredictability as a wider distribution rather than fixing it. A new top-level "Reporting Delivery Capacity to a Skeptical Board" section, general engineering-management guidance with no case study and no named individuals, reframes board doubt after a slipped estimate as a trust and visibility problem rather than a data problem, states that no published study measures whether delivery-intelligence tooling repairs executive trust, and covers named delivery scenarios over velocity charts, capped strategic objectives over multi-quarter feature roadmaps, tracking commitment hit-rate as the trust-rebuilding metric, and pre-aligning board members individually before the plenary meeting. The Uplevel Copilot study (no significant change to coding speed, PR cycle time, or throughput after adoption, alongside a 41% increase in bug rate and a "Sustained Always On" burnout-risk proxy that fell more for developers without Copilot) was added next to the existing Digital Applied heavy-user review-time finding, both making the same point from independent data. Both whitepapers translated in full (not stubbed) and `wp-version` bumped 1.1.0 to 1.2.0. Three new `deep_dive` keys: `team_metrics_tooling`, `team_metrics_forecasting`, `team_metrics_board_reporting`.
- **Two local Claude Code session inspectors added to the LLMOps section** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md` §9): cross-checked against a LinkedIn Learning course on token optimization ("Reduce AI Costs," Tejas Chopra, published 2026-07-30). Verified via web search before adding, since the course names them without links: claude-devtools (`matt1398/claude-devtools`, MIT, `brew install --cask claude-devtools`), a desktop app giving per-turn token attribution across 7 categories (CLAUDE.md, skills, @-mentions, tool I/O, thinking, team overhead, user text), finer-grained than the native `/context` bar; and tokview (`headroomlabs-ai/tokview`, MIT), a local proxy/dashboard with per-tool-call attribution that backfills from existing JSONL history. tokview ships from the same org as Headroom, already documented in this section with a skepticism note on self-reported figures, and the new entry carries the same caveat forward. Everything else the course covers (RTK, Serena, Headroom, Ponytail, Caveman, `/context`, `/compact` at 70%, Anthropic's `count_tokens` endpoint, MCP tool search / progressive disclosure, lost-in-the-middle) was already documented here in more depth, generally with tighter sourcing than the course's own toy-repo demo numbers.
- **AI Unit Economics gained a lever on skill and tool injection cost, the piece none of §3's four existing levers covered** (`guide/ops/ai-unit-economics.md` new §3 subsection, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`): the existing levers (route by complexity, isolate in sub-agents, cap iterations, reuse cached context) reason about the model call itself, not about what a skill or MCP tool call injects into context. The gap surfaced from a practitioner's measured example: a skill loading at roughly 12K tokens paired with a query whose injected result cost over $1 on the generating call and roughly $0.11 in cache-read on every following turn, and a screenshot from the same source showing a single skill invocation at $5.33 on 208.9K tokens next to `TASKCREATE` calls at roughly $0.001 each, over five thousand times the cost of the calls around it (Marek Kalnik, CTO at Theodo, LinkedIn post, July 2026). The new subsection frames this as a governance decision rather than a rule: a skill that injects a large result earns its cost on a task that genuinely needs it, and burns money on a routine task matched by too broad an auto-trigger condition. No break-even point is asserted, since the source practitioner, asked directly, confirmed none has been measured. The subsection points to the native `/usage` per-category cost breakdown (v2.1.149) as the tool for measuring a given skill's actual injection cost before deciding whether its trigger condition is too wide. New `deep_dive` key: `ai_unit_economics_skill_injection_cost`.
- **Executor documented as a productized form of the manual MCP registry pattern** (`guide/security/enterprise-governance.md` new §3.5, `docs/resource-evaluations/executor-integration-governance-layer.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): Executor (UsefulSoftwareCo/executor, MIT, `1.4.0-beta.0`) maps its four concepts (integration, connection, policy, MCP exposure) almost one-to-one onto the registry format §3.2 already documents by hand, with one addition the hand-built version lacks, a `SecretRef` indirection so a credential never appears in a tool schema or MCP response. Scored 3/5: no missing category filled, a well-documented example of one already covered. Framed explicitly as comparison, not a replacement recommendation, since teams actively copy §3.2's YAML into their own `.claude/mcp-registry.yaml` and a beta at bus factor 1 (93% of 2,532 commits by one contributor, cadence down 76% from an April peak, measured 2026-07-29) is a different risk profile than a dependency-free file they can read end to end. `guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`'s "Tooling in this space" table gained a short paragraph naming the token-cost axis versus the access-governance axis explicitly, since Klavis AI/Strata sits on both and that ambiguity is what made Executor look like it belonged in a token-savings table it does not compete on.
- **agentOS documented as the in-process counter-example missing from the cloud sandbox comparison** (`guide/security/sandbox-isolation.md` §5, new TL;DR row, `docs/resource-evaluations/agentos-in-process-agent-vm.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): every existing entry in §5 (Fly.io Sprites, Cloudflare Sandbox SDK, Vercel Sandboxes, E2B) bills through a cloud provider; agentOS (`@rivet-dev/agentos`, Apache 2.0, `0.0.1` preview) runs a Rust-kernel-plus-WASM-sandbox VM inside the host's own Node process instead, with 42 real upstream Linux tools (git, ripgrep, sqlite3, duckdb) compiled to `wasm32-wasip1` against an owned sysroot. Scored 4/5, higher than Executor's 3/5, because it fills a documented gap and shows a rising two-month commit trend rather than a declining one. The entry states plainly that "VM" is a marketing choice (no KVM, no Firecracker, isolation is a V8 isolate plus WASM, the project's own threat model names the sidecar/executor process as the boundary, not a hypervisor) and that the vendor's 4.8ms/92x benchmarks are single-machine and not independently reproduced.
- **just-bash documented as the other end of the in-process spectrum from agentOS** (`guide/security/sandbox-isolation.md` §5, new TL;DR row, `docs/resource-evaluations/just-bash-simulated-shell.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): agentOS runs a real, if hypervisor-less, VM (Rust sidecar plus V8 isolate); just-bash (vercel-labs/just-bash, `3.2.0`) runs no VM at all, a bash lexer/parser/interpreter written directly in TypeScript over an in-memory virtual filesystem, with containment resting entirely on JS-level defenses (`DefenseInDepthBox`, null-prototype objects, per-call resource limits, each mapped to a named vector in the project's own 31.5 KB `THREAT_MODEL.md`). Scored 4/5: past `3.x` on npm with a changeset release pipeline and a public website demo, a stronger maturity signal than agentOS's `0.0.1` preview, same bus-factor-1 risk (Malte Ubl, 322/380 commits, 84.7%) already flagged in the Executor and agentOS evaluations. One concrete gap named directly rather than smoothed over: the repository has no `LICENSE` file at its root despite the README's Apache-2.0 claim. No §6 Comparison Matrix column added, same call as agentOS, since most of its criteria (Docker-in-Docker, kernel isolation) do not apply to an in-process simulator.
- **A fourth data point added to the file-based memory comparison** (`guide/core/memory-systems.md` §3.7): Executor's `MISTAKES.md`/`DESIRES.md`/`LEARNINGS.md` run the same plain-file-committed-to-Git pattern as ORF and DiffMem, with one design choice that departs from all three existing examples: the files are gitignored, private working memory rather than shared team history.
- **A third independent source added to the progressive-disclosure convergence** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md` §4): Gorgias Engineering's "Building a Context Layer From the Ground Up" documents a production SQL-generating agent that rejected a monolithic table-description prompt for a three-tier context layer (per-table `when_to_use`/`how_to_use` metadata, hierarchical topic instructions, skill playbooks), citing progressive disclosure as their single biggest reliability improvement. Cross-referenced against the existing Dev With AI meetup finding on monolithic CLAUDE.md files, since both land on the same architecture from unrelated starting points.
- **A new skill-design pattern: multi-directory skill discovery for cross-CLI repositories** (`guide/core/skill-design-patterns.md`): Executor runs `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.skills/`, and `.codex/environments/` side by side rather than consolidating into one directory, read as convergence across CLI conventions (Claude Code, a generic agent convention, a project-shared set, Codex) rather than disorganization. The pattern entry also notes the README's curated "References" reading list (FumaDB, Effect, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Emdash, Pi) as a related, separate convention worth naming.
- **Two new resource evaluations indexed** (`docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): Executor (3/5, watch-list, cross-reference only) and agentOS (4/5, integrated). `resource_evaluations_count` moves from 167 to 169 files on disk, `resource_evaluations_indexed` from 48 to 50.
- **A "build a mini agent to understand it" resource added to the learning path, sourced from the canonical English article instead of the French one that prompted the search** (`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md` § External Resources, `docs/resource-evaluations/kajan-siva-mini-claude-code.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): Kajan Siva's "Construire un mini Claude Code pas à pas" (French, 9-min read, working code and a companion GitHub repo) scored 2/5, not because it is wrong but because it restates the same loop already documented at Tier 1 confidence in `guide/core/architecture.md` §1 "The Master Loop", and because it is French-only against this repo's English-only rule. Thorsten Ball's "How to Build an Agent" (ampcode.com), the most-cited article in the same genre, English, ~300 lines of Go, was added in its place.
- **A third Rippletide-sourced resource evaluated and rejected** (`docs/resource-evaluations/084-rippletide-harness-is-the-agent.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): a LinkedIn blog post by co-founder Yann Bilien, "The Harness is the Agent, What's Inside?", scored 2/5. Its three diagrams (harness anatomy, capabilities-vs-performance split, test-eval-modify iterate loop) map close to one-to-one onto `guide/core/agent-harness.md`'s nine components, already sourced to arXiv 2605.18747, Fowler, and Anthropic telemetry, and the article carries zero citations or measured claims of its own. No watch-list entry added: the pattern across all three Rippletide submissions (072 at 2/5, 081 at 3/5, this one at 2/5) trends toward restating known concepts rather than surfacing new, checkable information.

- **`/sandbox-unblock`, a diagnostic protocol for sessions that believe the sandbox is blocking them** (`examples/skills/sandbox-unblock/SKILL.md`, referenced from `guide/security/sandbox-native.md` §13, indexed as `sandbox_unblock_skill`): over one day of real work, six of eight reported sandbox blockers turned out to be false, and every one traced to the same handful of method errors. The skill front-loads eight checks so the report that reaches a maintainer is worth acting on: do not infer Bash restrictions from the `read.denyOnly` list in the system prompt (those patterns govern the Read tool only); confirm `$TMPDIR` shows the invocation ran sandboxed; put the `cd` and the tested command in the same Bash call, because the working directory resets between calls and two independent audits declared a package manager broken after landing in the wrong directory; check the binary exists before blaming policy, since output-compressing wrappers replace clear messages with bare errnos; read the real exit code rather than a pipe's; check whether a `PreToolUse` rewriter sits between the command and the `excludedCommands` matcher, which is what made prefixed entries work while unprefixed ones stayed inert; remember that an entry matches the command exactly as written, so `git -C /path fetch` and bare `git fetch` both miss `git fetch *`; and restart the session if the config changed after it opened. Ships a report template that forbids paraphrasing the error, an escalation section naming the two keys that mislead (`credentials.envVars` in `deny` mode leaves the variable readable to Bash, and `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false` does not neutralize `excludedCommands`), a network section separating an allowlist refusal (hangs 5 to 7 seconds) from a hostname that does not resolve (fails under 30 ms even when a wildcard covers it), and a table of limits with no configuration fix.

- **`/sandbox-status` referenced four configuration keys that do not exist** (`examples/skills/sandbox-status/SKILL.md`): the script read `.sandbox.autoAllowMode`, `.sandbox.filesystem.allowedWritePaths`, `.sandbox.filesystem.deniedReadPaths` and `.sandbox.network.policy`, none of which are real, so every `jq` lookup fell through to its default and the command printed `not set` for a fully configured sandbox. A status tool that reports "no restrictions" on a restricted machine is worse than no tool, since it converts a real policy into a clean bill of health. Now reads `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed`, `filesystem.allowWrite`, `credentials.files[].path` and `network.strictAllowlist`, and additionally surfaces `allowUnsandboxedCommands` so an audit can see whether the escape hatch is open. Example output updated to match, and both sandbox skills now cross-link.

- **A `permissions.deny` read rule does not reach a Bash subprocess, and a double dissociation proves it** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): the rule looks like a denylist and reads like one, so it gets audited as protection it does not provide. Measured on 2.1.220 in one session, on one machine: `~/.npmrc` carried a `sandbox.credentials.files` entry and no deny rule, and `cat ~/.npmrc` returned `Operation not permitted` 5/5; a project `.env` carried `Read(**/.env*)` and no credentials entry, and `cat .env` returned exit 0 5/5 on a file holding real secrets. Only the credentials block reaches sandboxed commands, and it resolves absolute paths rather than `**/` patterns, so a rule shaped like `**/.env*` has nothing to compile into the Seatbelt profile. Since `.env` files sit wherever projects put them, no absolute path closes the gap and a `PreToolUse` Bash hook is the remaining move. The guide now specifies its scope: block the readers that print or copy, leave `source .env` alone, because breaking how developers load their own variables costs more than the exposure it removes.
- **`.idea/` and `.vscode/` deny writes inside `allowWrite`, which kills `pnpm install`** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`): a narrower `allowWrite` entry does not take the ground back, since the deny resolves inside the allow. Tested against `.serena`, `.cursor`, `.zed`, `.fleet` and `.settings`, all of which accept writes, so this is specific to those two names rather than a general rule about dotted config directories. It surfaces as a supply-chain paper cut: a package shipping a `.idea/` folder in its tarball fails during extraction and leaves `node_modules/` truncated. Running the install in a terminal is the cheap fix, and `pnpm install*` in `excludedCommands` is the expensive one, since it unsandboxes every postinstall script in the tree.
- **`echo $TMPDIR` tells you whether a command actually ran sandboxed** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): most sandbox bug reports are measurement errors, and one variable explains nearly all of them. Because `excludedCommands` unsandboxes the whole invocation, a probe sharing a line with `git`, `gh`, `ssh` or `docker` reports on the unsandboxed world, and sessions then trade contradictory findings about the same machine. Sandboxed commands get a per-session `$TMPDIR`; unsandboxed ones inherit the shell's. An A/B binding a Unix socket makes the mechanism visible and catches the third trap in the same table: the probe alone is denied, the probe plus `git -C <path> fetch origin` is still denied because `-C <path>` breaks the `git fetch *` match, and the probe plus `git fetch origin` succeeds with `$TMPDIR` switched to the shell value. One flag decides whether the entire line runs sandboxed.
- **Three failures with no configuration fix, documented so they stop being tuned against** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`): setuid binaries cannot exec, so `ps`, `top`, `su` and `login` (mode `04000`) report `operation not permitted` while `lsof` and `whoami` run fine, and `lsof -nP -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` is the direct substitute for `ps aux | grep`. `AF_UNIX` `bind()` then `listen()` is denied in every writable directory including `$TMPDIR`, and `network.allowLocalBinding` covers TCP only, so `tsx` and anything else opening an IPC server at startup will not run; bundling with `esbuild` first sidesteps it. Writes to `.idea/` and `.vscode/` are the third.
- **The domain allowlist filters even in permissive mode, and two rounds of this entry got it wrong** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): the section first described a `policy` field that does not exist and called allowlist mode the default. The real switch is `strictAllowlist`, default `false`. The correction then overshot and claimed the list was inert whenever `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` was on, resting on `example.com` and `api.openai.com` returning HTTP 200 against a 23-entry list. Both hosts sit in the built-in default list, so that test proved nothing about filtering. Re-measured on 2026-07-30 against a 32-entry list: `neverssl.com` stayed unreachable, and `cursor.com` and `www.jetbrains.com` went from unreachable to HTTP 200 on the addition of their wildcard alone, taking effect immediately with no session restart. Pick test hosts from outside the built-in defaults before concluding a list does nothing. A second note now distinguishes a blocked host from a nonexistent one: an allowlist refusal hangs 5 to 7 seconds, while an unresolvable hostname fails in under 30 ms even when a wildcard covers it (`api.cursor.sh` and `cloud.ollama.com` failed in ~25 ms while covered by `*.cursor.sh` and `*.ollama.com`; neither host exists). The `deep_dive` key `sandbox_allowlist_inert_with_autoallow` is replaced by `sandbox_allowlist_filters_without_strict` and `sandbox_blocked_host_vs_missing_host`. Also notes that `github.com` does not cover `codeload.github.com`, where npm and pnpm fetch git dependencies and tarballs.

- **Sandbox troubleshooting rewritten around what actually breaks, not what looks dangerous** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): the existing troubleshooting covered `watchman`, Docker, and Go CLI TLS. None of those were what a day of real use on a 200-repository setup produced. The sandbox fails on paths a toolchain uses without announcing them, so the section now opens with the break-in period: expect about a week before a configuration stabilizes, and widen a path because something broke rather than because something might. The worked example ends at 13 write paths with the failure that produced each one, in roughly the order anyone will hit them.
  - **`network.allowLocalBinding` defaults to `false`**, which breaks every local dev server and every tool that proxies its own traffic to inspect it. It had one line in the settings reference and nothing anywhere else. Discovered through a supply-chain firewall wrapping `pnpm install`, where the message named the firewall rather than the bind, putting the cause two steps from the symptom.
  - **Globally installed npm CLIs cache inside their own install directory**, under `~/.nvm/versions/node/<version>/lib/node_modules`, so the path also moves on every node upgrade. Allowing it is a genuine trade-off rather than a free fix: that directory holds `$PATH` executables, and write access there is a documented escalation route. Documented as a decision to make, not a discovery to have later.
  - **Read the last error, not the first.** A denied credential read warns on every later command and survives the actual fix, so it collects the blame. `credentials.files` on `~/.npmrc` makes every `pnpm` invocation open with an `EPERM` line, including the successful ones, because package managers fall back to the default registry. Three separate sessions blamed it while the real causes sat three steps further down and the warning kept printing after the install completed. A denied read is usually survivable; a denied write or bind is not.

- **Index coverage is now enforced instead of remembered** (`scripts/check-index-coverage.py`, `.github/workflows/index-integrity.yml`, `.claude/hooks/index-sync-reminder.sh`, `.claude/rules/index-sync.md`): the CI already answered "do the references in `reference.yaml` still resolve?" but nothing answered the opposite question, "did anything land in `guide/` that the index never learned about?". That gap is what produced the July 28 finding where ten guide files, including the entire `guide/learning-path/` series, had never been indexed at all. An unindexed page is invisible to the MCP server and to the landing's Cmd+K palette, and the only signal was an anchor audit months later. The new script measures file-level coverage; it reported 92/92 when added, so the CI gate is hard at zero with no ratchet to unwind. A `Stop` hook reports at end of turn when `guide/` changed and no index file did, which catches the more common case of a new section inside an already-indexed file, where no automated check can distinguish a typo fix from a new concept. The hook warns and never blocks: a turn can legitimately end mid-edit, and a hook that vetoes that is a hook people disable. A rule file documents what to update where, since the hook only says "you forgot". Choosing a hook over a rule alone is deliberate: a rule is a reminder the model can rationalize past, and it costs context every session, while the hook is deterministic.
- **A third `excludedCommands` trap, found while unblocking a real session** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): beyond the bare-name form that never matches and the glob that unsandboxes the whole invocation, an entry matches the command *as written*, so any wrapper, prefix, or loop silently sends the command back into the sandbox. `gh api rate_limit` runs unsandboxed and returns; `rtk gh api rate_limit` is sandboxed and fails. The two differ by a four-character prefix. A `PreToolUse` hook that rewrites commands, which token-optimizing proxies do by design, therefore disables every exclusion naming a wrapped binary with no report. The same applies to `for d in a b; do (cd $d && git push); done`, where the string starts with `for`. The symptom is never "your exclusion did not match": it is `Operation not permitted` on a path, or a Go CLI failing certificate verification with `x509: OSStatus -26276` because it cannot reach the macOS keychain from inside Seatbelt. That error is now indexed as a diagnostic signature, since it was independently misdiagnosed twice in one session as an expired token, an EDR agent, and a macOS security policy.

### Fixed

- **Two positional references drifted after the security guide expansion** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`): updated the Docker network-policy and Agent Skills supply-chain targets to their current heading lines and added machine-checked anchor declarations so future line insertions can repair them safely.
- **`check-landing-sync.sh` reported a false quiz-count mismatch on every run** (`scripts/check-landing-sync.sh`): the quiz check compared `QUESTIONS_COUNT` against `LANDING_QUESTIONS_HERO` unconditionally, but `HeroBanner.astro` was refactored to render `{stats.quizQuestionCount}` from `site-stats.ts` instead of a hardcoded number, so the grep for a literal `[0-9]+ questions` pattern always returned empty and the comparison always failed. The templates check just above it already guarded this exact case (`-n "$LANDING_TEMPLATES_HERO"`), the quiz check never got the same guard. Applied the same empty-value guard so a dynamically-rendered stat no longer registers as drift.
- **91 files still carried pre-subdirectory-migration guide paths, invisible to the anchor and path checks because they live outside `machine-readable/reference.yaml`** (`docs/resource-evaluations/*` ~55 files, `.claude/` and `.agents/` mirrors, `examples/`, `quiz/questions/{11-learning-with-ai,12-architecture}.yaml`, `whitepapers/{en,fr}/*.qmd`, `mcp-server/{IDEAS.md,src/prompts/index.ts}`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` historical entries): the `guide/` restructure that moved files into `core/`, `security/`, `ecosystem/`, `ops/`, `roles/`, and `workflows/` subdirectories only updated links the reference/anchor validators cover. A repo-wide sweep found flat paths like `guide/architecture.md` still pointing at a location nothing has occupied since the migration, 289 replacements in `CHANGELOG.md`'s own historical entries alone. 25 further dead anchors were fixed in the same pass, each verified against the repo's own `slugify()` output rather than assumed from the text.
- **A dangling `#27-configuration-decision-guide` anchor in `README.md` and three "See also" cross-references inside `guide/ultimate-guide.md`, all pointing at a TOC entry for a section that had already been deleted**: the phantom "2.7 Configuration Decision Guide" line survived in the table of contents and the "Quick jump" bar after the section itself was merged into Memory Loading Comparison. All four now point at `#memory-loading-comparison`, with matching visible link text.
- **`slugify()` diverged from the real `github-slugger` package (missing `.strip()`), producing dead anchors in three independent copies of the function** (`scripts/resync-reference-yaml.py`, `scripts/validate-reference-yaml.py`, `scripts/gen-section-maps.py`): a heading with trailing whitespace before its closing produced a slug with a trailing hyphen the real GitHub renderer never emits, so anchors built from it 404 in production while validating clean locally, since all three copies shared the same bug and cross-checked each other into agreement. Found via two independent agent investigations (a Cmd+K duplication regression and an undeclared bare-integer audit) that both surfaced the same root cause from different symptoms. Fixed at the source and the two duplicate copies now import from it instead of re-implementing it. 10 heading-to-slug pairs pinned against the real `github-slugger` package in the test suite so the divergence cannot silently return. 16 dead anchors in the live index traced to this bug and repaired.
- **Ambiguous-slug references were stuck at a permanent LOW-confidence floor with no path to resolution** (`scripts/resync-reference-yaml.py`): `anchor_line()` correctly refuses to guess when a slug matches more than one heading, but three references (`task_hierarchy_design`, `task_status_transitions`, `task_metadata_conventions`) legitimately pointed at a "Best Practices" heading duplicated four times in the guide, and no declared-anchor comment could resolve them since a `# anchor:` declaration is refused the same way on an ambiguous slug. Added a `hint_line` parameter: the stored line resolves the ambiguity if and only if it is exactly one of the real candidate headings, so drift outside that candidate set is still caught rather than silently accepted. Three tests confirm the hint resolves either candidate and still refuses a hint that matches none of them.
- **`llms-full.txt`'s Hooks section listed 9 hook filenames that do not exist in `examples/hooks/`, and falsely claimed PowerShell mirrors every bash hook 1:1** (`llms-full.txt`): an earlier audit pass fixed 4 dead paths and 3 stale counts in this file but left the Hooks list unverified against the filesystem. Rewritten against `ls examples/hooks/{bash,powershell}/`: 12 real bash hooks replace the fabricated list, and the PowerShell section now states it covers a subset (2 files), not a mirror. The Agents count was also off by two (23 claimed, 21 real, `loop-monitor.md` was missing from the enumerated list).
- **The Cmd+K search index carried 698 entries resolving to only 464 distinct URLs** (landing repo, `scripts/build-guide-index.mjs`): the entry generator stripped anchors before deduplicating, so every `deep_dive` key pointing at a different heading in the same guide file collapsed onto one search result, and the anchor a user actually needed was gone by the time the entry reached the palette. Rewrote the loop to keep anchors and dedupe on the final resolved URL instead of the bare path, with an explicit map for the three guide files that are client-side-redirect stubs (`ai-ecosystem.md`, `ai-roles.md`, `claude-code-releases.md` reroute to `/ecosystem/`, `/roles/`, `/releases/`, which share no heading structure with the guide markdown at all and would otherwise have silently produced 3 more broken entries). Verified against the actual built `dist/` HTML: 696 entries, 696 distinct URLs, 0 collisions, all 266 non-GitHub entries resolve.
- **Deleting one TOC line shifted every reference below it by one, and the ratchet's confidence-based check caught only some of the damage** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`): removing the phantom "2.7 Configuration Decision Guide" TOC entry shifted the rest of `guide/ultimate-guide.md` by -1 line. `--apply` auto-repaired the 25 declared-anchor references whose line had drifted, but 73 undeclared references (56 bare integers, 12 `path:line` refs into `ultimate-guide.md`, 5 into `guide/security/sandbox-isolation.md`) sat below the word-overlap heuristic's confidence floor and needed a targeted fix. Diagnosed by classifying the same reference set against the pre-edit commit in a worktree (611 apparent baseline failures turned out to be a copy artifact from only 3 files being present; a full worktree checkout showed the true pre-existing baseline was 8, all `ANCHOR_DEAD`, unrelated to this shift) and confirming programmatically that every one of the 73 resolved to sensible content at exactly `old_line - 1`. One `--apply` run had already produced a bad auto-repair earlier in this same investigation (`mechanism_comparison_table` jumped to an unrelated "Scheduled Tasks" table on generic "comparison table" word overlap), caught by reading the actual content at both locations before accepting it, corrected by hand with a declared anchor. The 12 `path:line` refs were migrated to `path#anchor` where the shifted target landed on a real heading (8 of 12; the other 4 landed on code-block comments that only coincidentally start with `#`, kept as corrected line numbers). One ambiguous target (`security-considerations`, 3 duplicate headings) was kept as a corrected line number rather than a plain anchor, to avoid re-introducing the exact ambiguity this file's `hint_line` mechanism exists to catch. `resync-reference-yaml.py --check` now reports a genuine 0 broken (up from a false 0 that a path-string bug in an ad hoc verification script had reported earlier in the same investigation), confirmed against the full CI suite: `validate-reference-yaml.py --ci` 0 hard failures, `test-resync-reference-yaml.py` 57/57, `check-index-coverage.py` 92/92.
- **The `reference.yaml` positional-reference backlog is closed: 145 to 0, and the CI ratchet is gone rather than lowered** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `scripts/resync-reference-yaml.py`, `.github/workflows/index-integrity.yml`): every one of the 145 was decided from the real content of its target file, in groups by file, never by lowering a confidence threshold. 137 became `path#anchor` after checking which heading the key actually meant. Two measurement defects surfaced first, and both had been inflating the "undecidable" figure. 29 of the 37 UNKNOWN were not undecidable: the header index was built from a hardcoded whitelist of 14 files, so any reference into a file outside it scored against an empty index. `rpi_phase1_research` and `rpi_phase2_plan` were the standing example of an intractable case, and rpi.md has `## Phase 1: Research` and `## Phase 2: Plan` as real headings all along; they were invisible only because the file was not on the list. No guide edit and no key deletion were needed. Separately, 8 genuine references were out of scope entirely, hidden by the same substring guard the tool had already narrowed elsewhere: `claudemd_sizing` caught by "sizing", `tasks_api_limitations` by "limit", `subscription_token_budgets` by "budget", `subscription_opus_ratio` by "ratio", and four more. Bringing them into scope raised the honest starting figure from 145 to 153 before a single repair.
- **A bare integer can now declare which heading it means, which replaces a heuristic with a hard check** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `scripts/resync-reference-yaml.py`, `scripts/validate-reference-yaml.py`): the last 8 references could not be confirmed by token overlap even with verified targets, because the key name and the heading share no words. `cicd` pointing at "9.3 CI/CD Integration" is correct and scores zero, since the heading spells it "CI/CD". Weakening the heuristic to absorb that would have been guessing at scale in the other direction. A trailing `# anchor: some-slug` says which section the author meant, and the stored line is then correct if and only if it equals the line of the heading with that slug. Ambiguity resolves to a failure rather than to the first match, because GitHub suffixes a repeated slug `-1` and a duplicated slug identifies nothing. `--apply` repairs the line deterministically when text shifts above it, which is exactly the drift that produced this rot. Bare integers stay integers because the landing turns every `deep_dive` string starting with `guide/` into a Cmd+K entry, so converting the remaining 108 would add that many entries pointing into a 26,554-line file.
- **Both CI gates were shown to fail before being trusted, including the ratchet, which never had been** (`.github/workflows/index-integrity.yml`): the strict gate exits 1 on a corrupted guide anchor and on a declared anchor sitting 3 lines off its heading, naming the drift in both cases, and returns to 0 on restore. The ratchet exits 1 on a drifted declared anchor, then `--apply` repairs 15030 back to 15027 and it returns to 0; it exits 1 again on a typo'd declared anchor, reported as ANCHOR_DEAD. `--max-broken 145` is deleted rather than reduced, so the default of 0 fails the build on the commit that introduces the next imprecise reference. The workflow's path triggers now include `scripts/**` and the workflow file itself, which they did not: a change that broke a gate could not fire the workflow that runs it, only a later unrelated content edit could.
- **The two overlapping repair tools are one, and its four traps are covered by tests that fail on bad input** (`scripts/resync-reference-yaml.py`, new `scripts/test-resync-reference-yaml.py`, `scripts/fix-reference-refs.py` deleted): the earlier merge commit landed the combined tool but left the old one on disk. The test suite is 43 assertions and each trap is checked by a test that discriminates, running the known-bad implementation against the same input and asserting it is wrong. Verified by breaking each guard in turn: removing the counter guard produces 6 failures, widening it back to substring matching produces 8, replacing the fence tracker with a naive toggle produces 6, and loosening the path pattern to `"([^"]+):(\d+)"` produces 2. Two assertions about the fence trap were written wrong at first and the measurement corrected them. The synthetic fixture had a 4-backtick block containing a matched 3-backtick pair, so the naive toggle balanced out and got the right answer; it now contains a single unmatched opener. And on `enterprise-governance.md` the naive toggle does not find fewer headings, it finds more: 63 against 37. The failure is two-sided. Stuck inside a fence it drops 19 real sections; stuck outside one it invents 45 headings out of shell comments and the CLAUDE.md examples embedded in code blocks. Counting headings alone hides this, because the invented outnumber the dropped. The earlier note that it "dropped 9 valid sections" was an undercount.
- **The MCP server's bundled content is now gated in CI, after drifting again** (`.github/workflows/index-integrity.yml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`): `mcp-server/content/` is a hand-copied bundle published to npm, nothing regenerates it, and nothing checked it. It had drifted before, and it drifted again the moment `reference.yaml` was repaired. Same failure class as the reference rot itself, a copy nobody verifies. The gate diffs the three files against `machine-readable/` and prints the `cp` that fixes each one; verified by perturbing `llms.txt` and confirming exit 1, then restoring and confirming exit 0.
- **Two dead anchors nothing was checking** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`): `configuration_decision_guide_anchor` pointed at `#27-configuration-decision-guide`, a section that no longer exists, and it was invisible to the anchor validator because a bare `#slug` with no path does not match the pattern. It now points at Memory Loading Comparison, where the mechanism comparison table and the 56% skill-invocation warning both actually live. `security_claude_folder_audit` carried a comment naming §1.4 Repository Pre-Scan while its key names the .claude/ audit in §1.5; the key wins, and the comment now records the contradiction instead of hiding it.
- **The sandbox configuration example used six keys that do not exist** (`examples/config/sandbox-native.json`): `autoAllowMode`, `filesystem.allowedWritePaths`, `filesystem.deniedReadPaths`, `network.policy`, `excludedCommands` in the bare-name form, and `${HOME}` / `${CWD}` interpolation. The real keys are `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed`, `filesystem.allowWrite`, `filesystem.denyRead`, no `policy` field, the glob form, and `~/` or `/` prefixes with no interpolation. There was no `credentials` block at all. Copying this file produced a sandbox that protected none of what its own comments claimed, which is worse than a documentation gap: prose gets read critically, an example gets pasted. Rewritten against a configuration verified on 2.1.220 across a 200-repository park, with comments that explain each trap rather than paraphrasing the key names.
- **`llms-full.txt` carried 104 em dashes, starting on line 1** (`llms-full.txt`): the repo bans them and the `PostToolUse` hook enforces it, which meant the file could not be edited at all until it was cleaned. Converted to colons where the dash separated a label from its description (100 cases, the numbered section list and the bullet lists) and to commas elsewhere (4). Also adds a Security & Sandboxing block to the guide-structure section, which named ten guide areas and omitted the one this release documents most.

- **`excludedCommands` documented with a form that silently does nothing, in six places** (`guide/core/settings-reference.md`, `guide/security/sandbox-native.md`): every example used the bare-name form (`"excludedCommands": ["git", "docker"]`), which matches only the zero-argument string and therefore never fires on a real invocation. A reader following the guide configures something inert, sees the command still sandboxed, and has no way to tell why. This is the form the published JSON schema suggests, which is what makes it the default mistake ([anthropics/claude-code#10524](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10524)). All six examples now use the glob form, verified on 2.1.220 where `"git"` had no effect and `"git *"` worked immediately. Both the `sandbox.excludedCommands` reference entry and the `excludedCommands` section of the sandbox guide gained a warning about the second, worse trap: once a glob does match, **the entire Bash invocation runs unsandboxed**, including commands that execute before the excluded one, so `git status && cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` reads the key with `"git *"` in the list ([#81157](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/81157), open as of 2026-07-25 on 2.1.220). Both now document the mitigation: scope entries to the subcommands that need the network (`git push *`, `git fetch *`, and so on) rather than the binary, which keeps local git confined. Git over SSH is what forces the exception at all, since the sandbox proxy handles HTTP and HTTPS but not port 22 and blocks the `ssh-agent` socket, so an SSH remote fails at DNS resolution.
- **Two factual errors in the sandbox documentation** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`, `guide/security/sandbox-isolation.md`, `guide/security/security-hardening.md`): the guide claimed `curl` and `wget` are "blocked by default in the sandbox to prevent arbitrary web content fetching". There is no such blocklist. Both are constrained by the network allowlist like any other command, and a request to an allowed domain succeeds without a prompt: `curl https://api.github.com` returned HTTP 200 in 84 ms under auto-allow on 2.1.220, while a non-allowed host hung to timeout (`HTTP 000`, curl exit 28). The corrected text names the hang as the symptom to recognize, since a missing domain does not produce a clean error. Separately, five configuration examples used an `autoAllowMode` key that does not exist in any released version; the real key is `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed`.

### Added

- **The `sandbox.credentials` block documented for the first time** (`guide/core/settings-reference.md`): `credentials.files`, `credentials.envVars`, and the related `network.tlsTerminate` had zero occurrences anywhere in `guide/`, despite being the mechanism the official documentation recommends for the exact hole the guide already described. `sandbox-native.md` correctly stated that sandbox read access covers the entire computer, then offered `Read(~/.ssh/**)` deny rules as the remedy. Those rules do work, since Read deny rules merge into the sandbox configuration, but they cannot touch environment variables, and sandboxed commands inherit the parent environment unchanged. A reader came away believing their tokens were protected while every sandboxed command could still read them. The new entries cover `deny` for files and variables, `mask` with `injectHosts` for the case where a CLI must keep authenticating, why `mask` fails closed without `tlsTerminate`, and the scope restrictions (`mask` is honored only from user, managed, and `--settings`, so a repository cannot authorize the proxy to send real credentials). Verified on 2.1.220: with the entry in place, `ls ~/.ssh` from a sandboxed command returns `Operation not permitted` while the directory still appears in a home listing.
- **Three sandbox settings that existed only in the release notes** (`guide/core/settings-reference.md`): `filesystem.disabled` (v2.1.216), `network.strictAllowlist` (v2.1.219), and `allowAppleEvents` were recorded as "a release happened" and never documented as usable settings. Each now carries its scope restriction (all three are ignored from project settings), its trade-off, and for `filesystem.disabled` the list of protections it silently turns off, including `credentials.files` and the settings-file write protection. `strictAllowlist` is explicitly marked as the last thing to enable, since before the domain list has stabilized it converts every missing domain from a one-time prompt into a hard failure.
- **Six sandbox behaviors documented** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`): what survives auto-allow mode (deny rules, `rm` on `/` or `~`, content-scoped `ask` rules, with a bare `Bash` ask rule skipped for sandboxed commands), the plan-mode interaction that changed in v2.1.212 and again in v2.1.218, that subagents inherit the parent's sandbox and cannot widen it, the session temp directory and the `$TMPDIR` divergence between sandboxed and unsandboxed commands, the git-worktree exception for the shared `.git` directory, and the write protection on Claude Code's own `settings.json` at every scope with symlink resolution since v2.1.210. That last one is easy to hit: a script editing `~/.claude/settings.json` from Bash fails with `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted` while the same edit succeeds through the Edit tool, which is not sandboxed. Also adds the Ubuntu 24.04 AppArmor workaround, without which bubblewrap cannot create user namespaces and the sandbox fails to start with no obvious cause, plus the optional seccomp filter install.

- **MCP server was serving the rotted index: `mcp-server/content/` had drifted from `machine-readable/`** (`mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/llms.txt`): the directory is a strict mirror (verified byte-identical at an earlier commit), and it is what the `claude-code-guide` MCP server reads. Two of its three files had fallen behind: the reference copy carried 4 anchored references against 36 in the source and none of the 874 section-map anchors, meaning every consumer of the advertised "instant expertise" entry point was being handed the broken positions this pass had just repaired. `claude-code-releases.yaml` was already in sync. Checked before overwriting that the server actually understands the new format: `mcp-server/src/lib/section-reader.ts` already resolves `path#slug`, including Pandoc-style explicit ids and near-miss suggestions, so the anchor migration matches where that code was already heading.
- **Broken-reference backlog cut from 383 to 145, and the CI ratchet lowered to match** (`.github/workflows/index-integrity.yml`, `scripts/resync-reference-yaml.py`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): `scripts/resync-reference-yaml.py` already existed and already did key-name-to-heading matching, which is worth stating plainly, the rot accumulated anyway because nothing invoked it. Its own reported count was inflated by a parser bug: the pattern `"([^"]+):(\d+)"` also matched URLs and prose, so `claude_mem_dashboard: "http://localhost:37777"` was read as a file named `http://localhost` at line 37777, and a sentence ending in `... see guide/core/foo.md:2215` was read as a file named after the whole sentence. Both surfaced as `FILE MISSING` and inflated the total; the pattern now requires a repo-relative path under a known top-level directory, taking `FILE MISSING` to 0. With that fixed the real starting figure was 208, and applying the tool's own 63 HIGH and MEDIUM confidence corrections brought it to 145, clearing HIGH and MEDIUM entirely. What remains is 108 LOW and 37 UNKNOWN, where the key name does not identify a single heading well enough to correct without guessing.
- **`docs/resource-evaluations/README.md` status line was in French** (`docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): the repo's rule is English throughout. Translated, and the date refreshed to match the verified figures (167 files on disk, 48 in the index table). `README.md` date badges resynced via `./scripts/sync-version.sh`.

### Added

- **Index integrity is now enforced by CI in two layers, and the strict one is tested to fail** (`.github/workflows/index-integrity.yml`, `scripts/validate-reference-yaml.py`): the workflow already ratcheted the line-number backlog; it now runs `validate-reference-yaml.py --ci` first as a hard gate at zero, covering what a ratchet cannot, namely YAML parseability, anchor resolution against real headings, path existence, line-reference bounds and `section_maps` validity. Anchors do not drift when lines are inserted above them, so this gate is cheap to keep green, and a failure means something is genuinely broken rather than merely stale. The gate was verified by deliberately corrupting one anchor and confirming exit code 1, then restoring and confirming exit code 0 with the file intact, because the whole reason this rot survived for months is that the previous check could not fail: it only asked whether a referenced line existed inside a 26,554-line document. The script also had its hardcoded absolute working directory replaced with a path derived from its own location, which would otherwise have made it pass vacuously on a CI runner.

- **`reference.yaml` positional references repaired and migrated to anchors: 205 of 488 pointed at the wrong place** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, new `scripts/fix-reference-refs.py`, `scripts/validate-reference-yaml.py`, `scripts/gen-section-maps.py`): the index passed every check it had, because the only check was that a referenced line existed inside a 26,554-line file. That test cannot fail in a large document, so it validated nothing. Matching each YAML key name against the headings of its target file instead of trusting the stored position showed how far the file had rotted: `hook_templates` pointed 17,104 lines before "A.4 Hook Templates", `command_template` 17,643 lines before its section, `rtk_guide` 3,687 lines off, `mcp_secrets_management` 2,937. The appendix block drifted in lockstep, `appendix_a` through `appendix_d` and every `myths_*` key each exactly 5,480 lines early, which is the signature of upstream insertions never propagated rather than independent mistakes. 132 string references were migrated from `path:N` to `path#anchor`, 73 bare line numbers were repaired in place, and the tooling now converges (a second pass reports zero changes). Anchors were chosen deliberately over line numbers where the landing consumes the value: `build-guide-index.mjs` strips both, so the migration is invisible to the build, but anchors survive insertions above them while line numbers do not. The guide gained lines twice during this work and the drift figures moved between two runs of the same script, which is the argument for anchors made in real time. Bare integers pointing into `ultimate-guide.md` were repaired but not converted, since the landing ignores them and a line number is more useful than an anchor for reading a range out of a 26K-line file.
- **Two near-misses caught in the repair tooling before they were applied** (`scripts/fix-reference-refs.py`, `scripts/validate-reference-yaml.py`): the first pass would have rewritten `resource_evaluations_count: 120` to `26366` and `ui_ux_pro_max_stars: 33700` to a line number, because the pattern matching bare integers cannot tell a quantity from a position. A guard now protects keys whose name ends in a quantity suffix, backed by an independent bounds check that catches the rest (33,700 exceeds the file, so it cannot be a line regardless of what the key is called). The first version of that guard matched substrings anywhere in the key and swallowed six genuine references, `memory_files`, `cost_optimization`, `ui_ux_pro_max_guide` among them, so it was narrowed to suffix matching: protecting a real reference leaves it visibly unrepaired, whereas corrupting a counter is silent and propagates. Separately, the heading extractor used a naive fence toggle that desynchronised on any file with an odd fence count; `enterprise-governance.md` has 51 such lines, and the toggle got stuck inside a block and dropped 9 valid sections, reporting correct anchors as broken. Replaced with CommonMark fence semantics (matching character, length at least the opener, nothing trailing). Re-running the repair with the corrected extractor found 14 further fixes the broken version had missed.
- **Quiz block in `reference.yaml` described a structure that no longer exists** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`): `quiz_count: 334` against 473 real questions, `quiz_categories: 16` against 17, `quiz_file` pointing at a `quiz/questions.json` that does not exist, and a three-tier split (`quiz_beginner`, `quiz_intermediate`, `quiz_advanced`) referencing a `quiz/categories/` directory that does not exist either, with sub-totals of 60, 100 and 97 summing to 257, a number matching neither the old figure nor the new one. The real bank is one YAML file per category under `quiz/questions/`, and difficulty is a per-question field alongside a `profiles` list, not a per-category tier. Replaced with the verified counts, the category filenames, and the actual question schema; the invented tier sub-totals were dropped rather than replaced with guesses. `resource_evaluations_count` was likewise 120 against 167 files on disk, now recorded alongside the 48 that the README index actually lists, since those are two different real numbers.

### Added

- **Section maps: 874 H2 anchors across 78 guide files, none previously indexed** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `scripts/gen-section-maps.py`): coverage was measured per file, not per section, so a file counted as indexed while none of its sections were reachable. `ai-ecosystem.md` had 0 of 41 sections indexed, `cheatsheet.md` 0 of 27, `visual-reference.md` 0 of 20, `architecture.md` 0 of 19. Adding one `deep_dive` key per section would have worked but cost twice: roughly 600 keys in a file already at 44K tokens, and 600 more entries in the landing's Cmd+K palette, since `build-guide-index.mjs` turns every `deep_dive` string starting with `guide/` into a search entry. A top-level `section_maps` block of anchor lists sidesteps both, as that script only walks `deep_dive`. Duplicate slugs within a file are skipped rather than emitted, because GitHub would suffix them `-1` and the reference would not resolve. The generator is idempotent and replaces its own block on re-run.
- **Three maintenance scripts promoted out of the gitignored working directory** (`scripts/validate-reference-yaml.py`, `scripts/gen-section-maps.py`, `scripts/fix-reference-refs.py`): the validator checks YAML parseability, anchor resolution, path existence, line-reference bounds, how far each bare integer sits from its nearest heading, and `section_maps` validity in one pass. It is what would have caught this rot at any point over the past months. The generated block in `reference.yaml` carries the regeneration and validation commands inline, which is also why the scripts had to move: the block initially pointed at `claudedocs/`, a gitignored path, making the instruction dead for everyone but the session that wrote it.

- **New audit prompt: permission and sandbox posture** (`tools/permissions-audit-prompt.md`): a self-contained prompt that answers one question the existing tooling does not, whether a project's permission rules still constitute a boundary. `tools/audit-prompt.md` scores the whole setup across eight dimensions and `/security-audit` scans for secrets and injection surfaces; neither detects the failure mode where a single `allow` entry resolving to an interpreter (`Bash(bash *)`, `Bash(node:*)`, `Bash(python3 *)`) silently makes every `deny` rule in every scope bypassable, since the matcher treats `bash -c '<anything>'` as a `bash` command and never as the inner one. Six phases: blanket execution grants, rule population health, deny and ask coverage, sandbox posture, scope hygiene, and permission-mode interaction. The prompt embeds the documented matcher semantics rather than letting the model infer them, because that is where audits of this kind go wrong: the stripped wrapper list (`timeout`, `nice`, `command`, bare `xargs`) versus the runners that are *not* stripped (`npx`, `docker exec`, `devbox run`), the fact that an `allow` rule stops at an unknown env-var assignment while `deny` and `ask` match past any, that `:*` is only recognized at the end of a pattern, that protected paths are not pre-approvable by an `allow` rule in settings, that `sandbox.allowUnsandboxedCommands: false` constrains only the `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` retry and not `excludedCommands`, and that in auto mode `allow`, `ask`, and `deny` resolve *before* the classifier, so a narrow rule such as `Bash(git push:*)` does not merely skip a prompt, it removes classifier review from that action. Scored out of 100 with a deliberately lopsided weighting: any arbitrary execution grant zeroes 30 points on its own. Includes a fleet triage sweep that ranks repositories by exposure before running the full pass, so a thirty-repo park is not audited one indistinguishable finding at a time. Every finding must carry a reproduction command; the prompt explicitly forbids padding and forbids recommending `bypassPermissions` as a remedy for prompt fatigue. `tools/README.md` was three files behind and is corrected in the same pass: `context-audit-prompt.md` and `audit-cheatsheet-prompt.md` had never been listed, and a "which audit when" table now routes between the five, including `/security-audit` which lives as a slash command rather than a prompt file. Indexed in `machine-readable/reference.yaml` under `deep_dive` alongside the two existing audit-tool entries (a `deep_dive` key change means the landing's Cmd+K index needs `pnpm build:search`), and the `tools/` block in the root `README.md` tree, which listed two of the six files.

### Documentation

- **Built-in slash commands re-derived from the official reference, §10.1 rebuilt as the canonical table** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`, `guide/core/architecture.md`, `guide/core/visual-reference.md`, `guide/diagrams/01-foundations.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `machine-readable/llms.txt`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`, `quiz/questions/06-commands.yaml`): the guide cited commands across three overlapping tables that had drifted apart, and none of them named a source of truth. Every one of the 101 commands listed at `code.claude.com/docs/en/commands` was checked for an occurrence anywhere in `guide/`, `machine-readable/`, `docs/`, `examples/` and `README.md`. Thirteen had never been mentioned in any form: `/autofix-pr`, `/design-login`, `/design-sync`, `/fewer-permission-prompts`, `/heapdump`, `/install-slack-app`, `/passes`, `/privacy-settings`, `/radio`, `/run-skill-generator`, `/stickers`, `/stop`, and `/pr-comments` (the last one removed upstream in v2.1.91). Thirteen more appeared only inside historical release notes and never in a reference table: `/advisor`, `/claude-api`, `/dataviz`, `/verify`, `/run`, `/subtask`, `/security-review`, `/export`, `/ide`, `/reload-skills`, `/upgrade`, `/color`, `/usage-credits`. §10.1 is now the canonical table, all 99 current commands grouped into nine categories with aliases, arguments and availability constraints, opening with a source-of-truth callout pointing at the official page and at `cli-reference` for launch flags, and closing with a removed/renamed/never-existed section. §6.1 keeps a curated daily-driver subset and links to §10.1 rather than duplicating it, which is what let the two tables diverge. The official commands and CLI reference URLs were added to the Tier 1 sources table in `architecture.md`.
- **`/execute` removed: it is not a Claude Code command and never was** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` x5, `guide/cheatsheet.md`, `guide/core/visual-reference.md`, `guide/diagrams/01-foundations.md` x2, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`, `llms-full.txt`, `quiz/questions/06-commands.yaml`): the guide taught `/execute` as the way to leave plan mode in eleven places, including a quiz question whose explanation stated it outright. It appears nowhere in the official commands reference and nowhere in the 5,248-line upstream CHANGELOG. Plan mode is exited by approving the plan Claude presents or by pressing `Shift+Tab`. The landing quiz had already been corrected for this during the July 8 fact-check pass; the guide itself had not. A dedicated row in §10.1 now records that it is not a command, so the error does not get reintroduced from an old draft.
- **`/less-permission-prompts` renamed to `/fewer-permission-prompts` in reference material** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`, `llms-full.txt`): the old name is what shipped in v2.1.111 and is still correct inside that release's notes, which are left untouched as a historical record. Everywhere the guide presents a command as currently usable, it now uses the official name, with the former name given inline so the v2.1.111 notes stay findable.
- **`generate-examples-data.py` emitted invalid JavaScript, breaking the landing build** (`scripts/generate-examples-data.py`, landing `src/data/examples-data.ts`): category keys were written unquoted, so the eight containing a hyphen (`hooks-bash`, `hooks-powershell`, `claude-md`, `team-config`, `github-actions`, `mcp-configs`, `context-engineering`, `semantic-anchors`) were not valid bare identifiers and esbuild aborted with `Expected "}" but found "-"`. Found while trying to validate the quiz and cheat-card corrections through a landing build. The generator now quotes any key that is not a valid identifier; `examples-data.ts` was regenerated (268 entries) and `pnpm build` passes again at 428 pages.
- **French guide translation patched for the same command errors** (`guide/ultimate-guide.fr.md`): the file is generated by `scripts/translate-guide.py` and would pick up the corrected English source on the next run, but it is live on the landing today, so the six occurrences of `/execute` and the `/less-permission-prompts` row were corrected in place rather than left wrong until the next translation pass.
- **Command audit extended to the landing, the quiz banks, the whitepapers and the recap cards** (landing `src/content/cheatsheets/*.md`, `src/content/questions/**`, `src/data/glossary-data.ts`, `src/data/diagrams-data.ts`; `quiz/questions/*.yaml`; `whitepapers/{fr,en}/*.qmd`; `whitepapers/recap-cards/{fr,en}/*.qmd`; `whitepapers/CHANGELOG.md`): the guide was not the only surface teaching `/execute`. The web quiz contained a direct self-contradiction, question 02-009 stating "there is no /execute slash command in Claude Code" while 06-006 instructed readers to "use `/execute` to exit Plan Mode"; only the first had been caught in the July 8 fact-check pass. Every published surface was swept: 4 landing cheat cards, 9 quiz questions, 11 whitepapers, 6 recap cards. Seven quiz questions pointed their `official_doc` at `code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands`, a URL that now serves the skills page rather than the commands reference; the three about built-in commands were repointed at `/docs/en/commands` and the four about custom commands at `/docs/en/skills`. Question 10-022 taught that effort has three levels because "max was removed in v2.1.72", which was true then and is not now, so it gained a current-state paragraph covering `xhigh` (v2.1.111), `max` and `ultracode` rather than a rewrite that would have erased the historical framing. Question 10-028 described a nonexistent "Execute Mode". The CLI quiz YAML was regenerated from the canonical web bank with `pnpm sync-from-web` rather than hand-edited, per the one-way sync the July fork cleanup established.
- **Landing cheat card t03-permission-modes was two mode-model revisions behind** (landing `src/content/cheatsheets/t03-permission-modes.md`): its table listed "Auto-accept all" on `Shift+Tab x2` (that cycles to Plan mode), had no `plan`, `auto` or `dontAsk` rows at all, and presented `/less-permission-prompts` as the way to enter "Auto (Max users)" mode, which conflates a skill that writes an allowlist with a permission mode driven by a classifier. The card set is generated from `whitepapers/recap-cards/`, and the recap-card source had already been corrected in the July 3 pass; the landing copy had never been regenerated, so the two had silently diverged. The table now carries the six canonical mode names with their real activation paths, matching the recap card.
- **Command descriptions corrected against the official reference** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`, `guide/ultimate-guide.md`): four entries in the machine-readable index described something the command does not do. `/effort` listed the enum as `xlow/low/default/high/xhigh` (the real set is `low/medium/high/xhigh/max/ultracode`, with `max` and `ultracode` session-only), `/focus` was described as "focuses agent on specific files or tasks" (it toggles a minimal view), `/tui` as "shows tool calls in TUI mode" (it selects the renderer), `/proactive` as "enables proactive suggestions" (it is an alias of `/loop`) and `/undo` as "reverts last action" (alias of `/rewind`). The `/branch` versus `/fork` paragraph in §6.1 still described `/fork` as a plain alias of `/branch`, which stopped being true in v2.1.212 when `/fork` became "copy the conversation into a background session" and the in-session subagent moved to `/subtask`.
- **Feature-to-code anchoring section added to the legacy modernization chapter** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): covers the narrower case where the goal is not a rewrite but a verified pointer from each documented feature to the file and symbol implementing it. Describes the four-layer model (deterministic anchor, semantic extraction, deterministic gate, standardized output via OKF), the LSP-then-grep-then-unresolved resolution order with an `EXTRACTED` / `INFERRED` confidence field, and why a commit hash is a freshness marker rather than a permanent anchor. Three tools were evaluated hands-on against a legacy fleet running a non-standard in-house framework: Reversa (rejected, one CRITICAL path-traversal in its uninstall path, zero automated tests across 56 releases, bus factor of one, and an unverified confidence seal), code-graph-mcp (rejected on measured evidence, 12/12 false inferred edges at maximum confidence on Fastify and zero routes extracted on the custom framework), and Graphify (retained as the strongest deterministic building block, its `EXTRACTED` tag is architecturally enforced and it emits no edge rather than inventing one when framework detection fails).
- **Machine-readable indexes audited and resynced against the guide (2026-07-28)** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `machine-readable/cowork-reference.yaml`, `machine-readable/llms.txt`, `machine-readable/README.md`, `llms.txt`): the five files under `machine-readable/` were validated programmatically rather than eyeballed, and every claim they make about the repo was checked against the filesystem. `reference.yaml` had 10 section anchors that no longer resolved to a real heading, all in content that had been restructured since the anchors were written (`memory-systems.md` sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.6, 4.7 and 7.1, the METR and DeputyDev paragraphs in `adoption-approaches.md` which are bold text inside the J-curve section rather than headings of their own, and the annotation cycle in `plan-driven.md` which is `#phase-2-the-annotation-cycle`). Those anchors feed the landing's Cmd+K palette, so a stale one is a dead link in production, not just a cosmetic error. Ten guide files were indexed for the first time: the whole `guide/learning-path/` series (7 modules), `hooks-events-reference.md`, `community-patterns.md`, `dynamic-workflows.md`, `code-review.md`, `github-actions.md`, `agent-evaluation.md`, `team-metrics.md`, `api-gateway.md`, and `guide/cheatsheet.md` as a standalone file distinct from the in-guide section at line 19597. The Mermaid block claimed 41 diagrams across 10 files; the real figures are 48 across 12. Post-edit validation confirms 0 dead paths, 0 unresolved anchors, and 0 out-of-bounds line references across 265 line refs and 160 anchors.
- **`cowork-reference.yaml` rebuilt after pointing at a deleted directory for six months** (`machine-readable/cowork-reference.yaml`): the file still described Cowork at v1.0.0 (2026-01-20) and every documentation path resolved into `cowork/`, a directory removed from this repo in v3.9.7 (commit 9a29ba4). It is now at v1.12.0 with a `repo:` block giving the GitHub base URL of the dedicated `claude-cowork-guide`, matching the pattern `reference.yaml` already used for the Cowork cheatsheet. The content facts were refreshed too: Windows support since 2026-02-10 (the file still said macOS only), 1M-token context beta on Opus 4.6 (it said ~165K usable of 200K), the 11 official plugins and the Claude Legal extension, Agent Teams and scheduled tasks, and the current usage-window figures. Counts were taken from the Cowork repo's actual file tree rather than copied from its own index, which under-reports: 29 workflows not 28, 17 whitepapers not 12, and 4 sector prompt packs (conciergerie, ecommerce, immobilier, restauration) that had no entry at all. The naming convention trap is documented inline, since `prompts/` uses `.fr.md` for French while `workflows/` uses `.en.md` for English.
- **`llms.txt` coverage list rewritten, root copy resynced** (`machine-readable/llms.txt`, `llms.txt`): the file had not been touched since 2026-06-23 and was describing a guide two months out of date, including two figures that are now simply wrong (a "200K token budget" and "9 hook events" against the documented 30). Coverage now names memory systems, dynamic workflows, agentic software factories, enterprise governance, team metrics, API gateway cost control, AI unit economics, the learning path, and practitioner insights, and adds a machine-readable entry-points section plus the releases and whitepapers URLs. The root `llms.txt` was byte-identical to the `machine-readable/` copy at HEAD and was resynced so the invariant holds.
- **`machine-readable/README.md` corrected: it listed 2 of 4 files and understated `reference.yaml` by a factor of 22** (`machine-readable/README.md`): last touched in January (v3.1.0), the table omitted `claude-code-releases.yaml` and `cowork-reference.yaml` entirely and advertised `reference.yaml` at "~2K tokens" when it measures ~44K. Anyone following the file's own advice to paste it into a system prompt was quietly burning a fifth of a 200K window. Sizes are now measured and labelled as such, with an explicit note to grep the index and follow the path rather than load it whole, plus a maintenance section covering version sync, anchor drift after guide restructures, and the `pnpm build:search` rebuild that `deep_dive` key changes require on the landing.
- **`claude-code-releases.yaml` verified current, no change needed** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`): re-checked against the upstream `anthropics/claude-code` CHANGELOG and the weekly docs digest. v2.1.220 (2026-07-24) is still the latest published release, and both Week 29 features (MCP connectors in published artifacts, screen reader mode) were already tracked. Weeks 30 and 31 are not published yet.
- **GitHub star counts refreshed repo-wide via live API verification (2026-07-27/28)** (`guide/core/memory-systems.md`, `guide/learning-path/03-memory.md`, `guide/ecosystem/*.md`, `guide/core/methodologies.md`, `guide/core/community-patterns.md`, `guide/ops/devops-sre.md`, `guide/workflows/*.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.fr.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/*.md`, landing `src/data/ecosystem-data.ts`, `src/data/glossary-data.ts`, `src/pages/memory-systems/index.astro`, `src/pages/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.astro`, `src/pages/context-engineering/index.astro`, `src/components/landing/MemorySystems.astro`, `src/components/landing/TokenOptimization.astro`): every repo referenced with a stated star count across the living guide and the 55 dated `docs/resource-evaluations/` files was re-verified against `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO`, not left at whatever number was last typed in. Most tools grew substantially in the community's usual hypergrowth pattern (claude-mem 26.5K to 88.7K, agentmemory 16K to 25.9K, RTK 446 to 73.5K, obra/superpowers 95K to 262K, BMAD-METHOD 50.2K to 51.2K, awesome-claude-code 20K to 51K), and several repos had been renamed or transferred to new orgs since the number was recorded (kairn-ai/kairn to primeline-ai/kairn, safishamsi/graphify to Graphify-Labs/graphify, block/goose to aaif-goose/goose, steipete/mcporter to openclaw/mcporter, ryoppippi/ccusage to ccusage/ccusage, clawdbot/clawdbot to openclaw/openclaw, rely-ai-org/caliber to caliber-ai-org/ai-setup). Two anomalies are flagged inline rather than silently overwritten: `doobidoo/mcp-memory-service` now returns 404 (the account no longer resolves, marked `[UNVERIFIED]` everywhere it's cited), and `NicolasPrimeau/artel` dropped from 210 stars at its original listing to 7, a reminder to treat brand-new-repo star counts as noisy rather than a stable signal. The 151 dated resource evaluations keep their original historical figure intact (that's evidence of what was known when each was scored) and get a same-language appended annotation with the current count and verification date, rather than a rewrite. Landing pages get a visible "star counts verified" note on the memory-systems page and its `MemorySystems.astro` component, matching the pattern the user pointed at directly.

- **New subsection: Feature-to-Code Anchoring, a determinism-first alternative to legacy rewrite workflows** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §9.21, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): added under Legacy Codebase Modernization, covering the case where the goal isn't rewriting a system but building a verified pointer from a documented feature to the file and symbol that implements it (for costing, auditing a claimed status, or archival decisions). Documents a four-layer model (deterministic anchor, semantic extraction, deterministic gate, standardized output via OKF), the `EXTRACTED`/`INFERRED` confidence schema with LSP-then-`git grep` resolution order, and field-tested verdicts on three tools against a fleet with a non-standard in-house framework: Reversa rejected (CRITICAL path-traversal, zero automated tests across 56 releases, decorative confidence seal, frozen module-split guess when framework detection fails), code-graph-mcp rejected on evidence (12/12 false high-confidence edges measured on a modern stack), Graphify retained as the strongest deterministic building block (its `EXTRACTED` tag verified as architecturally enforced, not self-declared, though it still breaks on dynamic route dispatch). While editing this range, found that eight `harness_*` entries in `reference.yaml` (`harness_agents_md_as_toc` through `harness_throughput_merge`) already pointed roughly 550 lines short of their real target before this change, unrelated pre-existing drift, flagged here rather than fixed since locating their correct anchors is a separate pass. `resource_evaluations_appendix` was accurate and has been corrected for the 58-line shift this addition introduces (26294 to 26352).

### Fixed

- **Web and CLI quiz banks resynced onto a single source of truth, closing a two-bank content fork** (`quiz/questions/*.yaml`, `quiz/scripts/generate-from-web.mjs`, `quiz/README.md`, landing `src/content/questions/**`, `src/content.config.ts`, `src/utils/categories.ts`): the web quiz (Astro, one Markdown file per question) and the CLI quiz (YAML per category) had drifted past simple count mismatches. 344 shared `NN-YYY` ids held 38 outright answer contradictions and 60 unrelated questions reusing the same slot, and a further 60 CLI questions hid inside id slots that also existed in web with different content, undercounting the true gap. A full id-and-text cross-reference found 82 CLI questions with no web equivalent by any matching method. Each was triaged against the current guide before porting: 10 dropped for stale-model claims superseded by later releases (v2.1.90 fixed the exact caching bug one question described as unresolved) or answers the current guide contradicts outright; 72 ported into the web bank with fresh, non-colliding ids (the fork made old ids unsafe to reuse) and, where the CLI's declared `doc_reference` no longer matched any real heading, corrected to the anchor the content actually moved to (several had followed Agent Teams content from `ultimate-guide.md` into the dedicated `guide/workflows/agent-teams.md`). Team Metrics becomes web category 17. The web bank (canonical, 473 questions) now regenerates the CLI YAML through a one-way script (`pnpm sync-from-web`, with a `--check` mode for CI drift detection) that preserves each category's `source_file` header and replaces only its questions; the CLI README now tells contributors to edit the web Markdown and regenerate, not hand-edit the YAML, which is the practice that let the two banks fork in the first place.

### Security

- **Threat database updated to v2.24.0 (July 2026 AI-agent threats)** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`, `guide/security/security-hardening.md`): a monthly `/update-threat-db` pass covering disclosures from late June through July 12, 2026. Perplexity was down (401), so research ran on WebSearch plus targeted WebFetch against primary sources (Wiz, Cato Networks, Adversa AI, The Hacker News, Security Affairs). Added two Amazon Q Developer CVEs from the **GhostApproval** class (CVE-2026-12958 CVSS 7.8, CVE-2026-12957), a symlink approval-box spoofing flaw where a repo ships a file that is really a symlink to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` or an agent config dir, so the agent writes attacker content there while the confirmation dialog shows a benign in-project path (Wiz, disclosed 2026-07-08, also affects Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, Augment, Windsurf; Anthropic disputes it applies to Claude Code). Enriched the existing Cursor CVE-2026-50548/50549 entries with their **DuneSlide** name and Cato AI Labs attribution (zero-click prompt injection to OS-level RCE by overwriting the sandbox binary). Added four attack techniques: T034 GhostApproval, T035 **GuardFall** (structural denylist string-match shell-injection bypass hitting 10 of 11 open-source agents, no single CVE because the fix is architectural), T036 runtime DNS-TXT payload delivery via poisoned repo (0DIN, payload never in the repo so static scanners miss it), and T037 Friendly Fire (weaponized library docs during automated security review, medium confidence). Added two scanning tools (SkillScan Security, Tencent Zhuque **AI-Infra-Guard**) and 14 new source references. Mirrored GhostApproval and the DuneSlide naming into the security-hardening guide CVE table. YAML validated. Totals now: 191 sources, 102 CVEs, 37 attack techniques, 39 scanners.

### Documentation

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.220** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`, landing `src/data/releases.ts`, `mcp-server/content/`): five releases condensed, covering July 20 to July 24, 2026. The headline is **v2.1.219**, which makes **Claude Opus 5** (`claude-opus-5`) the default Opus model with 1M context and fast mode at $10/$50 per Mtok, drops Opus 4.7 from fast mode, and adds the `DirectoryAdded` hook, `sandbox.network.strictAllowlist`, and the `workflowSizeGuideline` settings key. Subagent limits moved twice in three days: v2.1.217 capped concurrent subagents at 20 (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONCURRENT_SUBAGENTS`), disabled nesting entirely, and finally made `--max-budget-usd` halt background agents; v2.1.219 then restored nesting to depth 3. v2.1.218 moved `/code-review` to a background subagent, required workspace trust for agent frontmatter hooks, and made `context: fork` skills run in the background by default. v2.1.216 added `sandbox.filesystem.disabled` and fixed a quadratic message-normalization slowdown that stalled long sessions. Two security fixes landed: symlinked working directories escaping background-session isolation (2.1.217) and untrusted-folder agent hooks (2.1.218). Added a Models and Behavior breaking-changes table to the Markdown release history, plus three milestone rows. MCP server content resynced and bumped to 1.2.6 (not published).

- **CLI quiz exposes all 17 bundled categories and refreshes new-quiz selection** (`quiz/src/index.js`, `quiz/src/quiz.js`, `quiz/src/topics.js`, `quiz/src/ui.js`, `quiz/README.md`): categories 11-17 were present in the YAML question bank but unavailable through the interactive picker or `--topics`; Power User now covers the complete bank, the PM profile has enough eligible questions to deliver its promised 10-question overview, and a new quiz avoids questions from the immediately preceding set when the pool allows it.

- **File-based experience-playbook memory documented: ORF integrated, DiffMem case study, ReasoningBank anchor, retex + BM25 practitioner pattern** (`guide/core/memory-systems.md` §3.7 + §3.9 + §4.7 + §9 + §10, `docs/resource-evaluations/diffmem-git-native-memory.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`, `guide/core/credits.md`): new §3.7 "File-Based Experience Playbooks" ties together the whole no-vector, Git-committable memory track. **ORF** (Guillaume Laforge) is documented as the primary entry: three-tier progressive disclosure (index ~200 / frontmatter ~500 / playbook ~800 tokens), the Abstracted-Insight vs Validated-Path schema split, and the deliberate divergence from **ReasoningBank** (Google, arXiv 2509.25140), which retrieves by embeddings where ORF retrieves by LLM-read frontmatter. **DiffMem** (Growth Kinetics) is added as a case study, not a recommendation, evaluated from source at HEAD `9d24d0c`: it **deleted its BM25 module** (commit `c4fe4a3`) in favor of LLM-agentic git-shell retrieval (one `run(command=...)` tool behind a whitelist, the agent greps and `git blame`s the repo instead of querying an index), with orphan-branch-per-user isolation via `git worktree`; disqualifiers logged (bus factor one, no LICENSE file, retrieval core untested and in a `rebuilding-retrieval` branch) plus the `shell=True` arg-validation injection caveat. The section carries the sharpest transferable lesson, **match retrieval to query shape**: DiffMem's semantic people-and-events queries killed BM25, but a coding-agent memory's lexical queries (error strings, stack traces, symbols) are exactly where BM25 beats embeddings at a fraction of the cost, so DiffMem's abandonment argues for retrieval fit, not against BM25. A **practitioner-pattern** subsection documents this guide's own `/retex` setup (structured lessons in `.claude/memories/retex-*.md`, session-start surfacing and inline warnings via `.claude/rules/retex-review.md`) and the existing BM25 `smart-suggest-routing` engine as the right retrieval base for a retex corpus, with an LLM-agentic git-shell pass as an optional escalation tier. Supporting edits: ORF + DiffMem rows in the §3.9 master comparison table, a Git-native distribution note in §4.7 (files sidestep the single-tenant-DNA barrier but inherit Git's non-semantic merge), a ReasoningBank academic anchor in §9, two new §10 open problems (consolidation/staleness of playbooks, plus the file-based track as the partial exception to "no Git equivalent for memory"), source links updated, and credits entries for Guillaume Laforge and Growth Kinetics. DiffMem promoted from a private working candidate to a tracked 3/5 evaluation; README index now shows ORF (3/5) and DiffMem (3/5), footer corrected to 167 files on disk / 48 indexed.

- **Broken internal guide links repaired** (`guide/core/architecture.md`, `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, `guide/security/data-privacy.md`, `guide/workflows/agentic-software-factories.md`, `examples/skills/eval-hooks/SKILL.md`): replaced ten invalid root-relative and machine-local destinations with portable repository-relative links.

- **ORF (Open Reasoning Format) evaluated, 3/5, integrate as a mention only** (`docs/resource-evaluations/orf-open-reasoning-format.md`): source-level evaluation of Guillaume Laforge's file-based cross-session memory format for coding agents ([blog post](https://glaforge.dev/posts/2026/07/21/open-reasoning-format/), 2026-07-21). An agent records operational learnings as Markdown playbooks with YAML frontmatter under `./experiences/`, then reloads them next session to skip dead ends it already paid for. The design bet is explicit: drop the embedding/vector retrieval that ReasoningBank (Google, [arXiv:2509.25140](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25140), verified) uses, and retrieve by filename plus one-line frontmatter descriptions read by the LLM, trading semantic recall for zero infrastructure and Git-committable files. Three patterns worth extracting were logged: three-tier progressive disclosure for retrieval with an explicit token budget (index ~200, category frontmatter ~500, single playbook ~800), separating the abstract insight from the validated concrete path in the 5-section schema, and an auto-synced `INDEX.md` that cannot drift because writing a playbook writes its index entry in the same operation. **Evidence quality scored 1/5**: the "66.7% to 100% SWE-bench Lite" figure is 3 tasks with one flipped, "-52% steps" is a single scenario, and the author states plainly it is "by no means a scientific evaluation"; no benchmark number is citable. The unproven core is retrieval without embeddings (an LLM reliably matching a task to a one-line description, no precision/recall data exists), and the author self-reports "haven't used the ORF skill in anger yet". Decision: mention in `guide/core/memory-systems.md` as the no-vector, Git-committable experience-playbook track missing from a list that is mostly SQLite-vec/ChromaDB, cite ReasoningBank as the academic anchor for success-and-failure memory (currently absent from the guide), and note it in §4 as a partial answer to the structural team-sharing gap (`git commit experiences/` shares one developer's agent fix with the team, though consolidation and staleness stay unsolved). Do not recommend the tool for production. Integration into the guide was completed in the follow-up pass below.

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.215** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): two new releases condensed (2.1.213 was never published upstream). **v2.1.214** (2026-07-18) is the heaviest security release of the 2.1.2xx line, with eight distinct Bash permission-check holes closed: single-segment allow rules like `Edit(src/**)` were auto-approving writes to nested `src/` directories anywhere in the tree instead of only `<cwd>/src`; commands over 10,000 characters now always prompt; file-descriptor redirect forms that bash parses differently than the permission analyzer now fail closed; zsh variable subscripts inside `[[ ]]` are no longer treated as inert text; certain `help` and `man` invocations that could smuggle command substitutions are no longer auto-allowed; and a bypass affecting Windows PowerShell 5.1 sessions was fixed. It also adds the **EndConversation tool** (Claude can end sessions with highly abusive users or jailbreak attempts, matching claude.ai behavior since 2025), a periodic progress heartbeat for long-running tool calls that previously went silent, `CLAUDE_CODE_OTEL_CONTENT_MAX_LENGTH` plus `message.uuid` / `client_request_id` / `tool_source` OpenTelemetry attributes for message-level correlation, and a large sweep of background-session lifecycle fixes (idle sessions keeping the daemon alive, completed sessions unremovable via `claude rm`, a displaced daemon deleting its successor's control socket). Three behavior changes worth noting for anyone with existing config: single-segment `dir/**` hook `if:` conditions now match only `<cwd>/dir` (write `**/dir/**` for any-depth, while `deny`/`ask` permission rules keep their any-depth match), `file -m`/`-f` is no longer auto-allowed as read-only, and `docker` daemon-redirect flags (`--url`, `--connection`, `--identity`, Podman remote mode) now prompt. **v2.1.215** (2026-07-19) stops Claude from invoking the `/verify` and `/code-review` skills on its own; both are now explicit-only. Milestone and breaking-change summaries updated in both files.

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.212** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): condensed two new releases. **v2.1.212** (2026-07-16) makes `/fork` copy the conversation into a new background session (the in-session subagent it used to spawn is now `/subtask`), adds a session-wide WebSearch cap (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_WEB_SEARCHES_PER_SESSION`, default 200) and a per-session subagent-spawn cap (`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENTS_PER_SESSION`, default 200), auto-backgrounds MCP calls running past 2 minutes (`CLAUDE_CODE_MCP_AUTO_BACKGROUND_MS`), and ships two security fixes (plan mode no longer auto-runs file-modifying Bash without a prompt; worktree creation no longer follows a committed `.claude/worktrees` symlink outside the repo); it also deprecates the Task tool's `mode` parameter, now ignored (subagents inherit the parent session's permission mode). **v2.1.211** (2026-07-15) adds `--forward-subagent-text` / `CLAUDE_CODE_FORWARD_SUBAGENT_TEXT` for subagent text and thinking in stream-json output, plus two security fixes (permission previews neutralize bidirectional-override and look-alike characters; auto mode no longer overrides a PreToolUse hook's `ask` for unsandboxed Bash). Milestone and breaking-change summaries updated in both files.

- **Market sweep of open-source orchestrators added, CAO documented, consultancy-backed factory cohort introduced** (`guide/ecosystem/agentic-tools.md`, `guide/workflows/spec-first.md`, `guide/workflows/agentic-software-factories.md`, `claudedocs/perplexity-prompt-agentic-software-factories.md`): a July 2026 research pass surfaced eight open-source multi-agent orchestrators (CAO, Mission Control, KanBots, Claw-Kanban, OpenKanban, Open Orchestrator, AI Agent Board, refute-or-promote), all re-verified against the GitHub API rather than the research summary. **Seven of the eight fail the bus-factor test**, with a single contributor holding 95% to 100% of commits; the lone exception is **CAO** ([awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator](https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator), Apache-2.0, 41 contributors, top at 20%), now documented as **§4.6** in `agentic-tools.md`. The sharpest illustration of the guide's star-count skepticism is preserved in that section: Mission Control carries 5,763 stars against CAO's 893 (6.4x) and one person wrote 78% of its commits, so sorting the market by stars selects the wrong tool. Provider list taken from CAO's README rather than the research summary, which had it wrong (Antigravity CLI, Hermes Agent, Cursor CLI, not Gemini/Q as reported). **New "consultancy-backed factory" cohort** added to the full-cycle factories section of `spec-first.md`: Thoughtworks AI/works (launched January 2026) and Agent/works (launched June 16, 2026, both confirmed via press releases), Solario/WeScale, Sopra Steria IAKA, Accenture AI Refinery, a category the previous table missed because it listed only VC startups; these lead with governance and sell velocity second, inverting the startup pitch. Solario is flagged hardest, since a platform positioned "Governance Before Scale" documents no enforcement mechanism, no underlying model, no pricing, no named customer. Agent/works' "provable compliance before execution" claim is flagged as the one worth watching (closer to model checking than prompt governance, if real). The unbounded-velocity section of `agentic-software-factories.md` gains the market-level finding: **no maintained open-source orchestrator industrializes adversarial verification** (execute the code to break it); every tool examined falls back to exit codes, pre-push hooks, or LLM-on-LLM review, which makes Fusion's dead-code double-checkout the closest thing to an answer anyone has written, and even Refute-or-Promote's own reference implementation is a one-star playbook abandoned three days after creation. The Perplexity prompt file gained a fourth section (relance #3, the falsifiable challenge that asks a search engine to disprove the "no verified production deployment" claim on the closed platforms) plus an ESN/consultancy axis and a Solario exclusion. All GitHub figures re-derived via `gh api` on 2026-07-16, none taken from the research summary. **Falsifiable-challenge pass run on the closed platforms** (WebSearch, since the Perplexity MCP returns 401): an active attempt to disprove the guide's "no independently verified production case study" claim on Devin, Factory.ai and Blitzy. The claim survived but was sharpened rather than left as-is, because the search surfaced a large volume of named-customer cases the previous wording ignored (Mercedes-Benz 200K lines COBOL 8 months to 8 days, Itaú 70% of vulns, Blitzy Fortune 100 33M lines in 3.5 days, QAD, Builders FirstSource 3x, Factory 550K hours saved). Every one traces to the vendor's own blog or sales page, not to the customer or a neutral party (Mercedes-Benz let Cognition publish the figure and published none of its own). Section 2 of `agentic-software-factories.md` was rewritten to draw the exact distinction (a named logo is an endorsement, not an auditable measurement) rather than imply the platforms have no customers, which a reader who knows those names would rightly reject. The only third-party signals found run against the platforms (three teams documented dropping Devin inside a quarter, field defect rates ~1.5-2x human code), and no independent comparative cost study between a closed factory and the native stack exists, the exact number that would settle the "almost never" judgment.

- **New orientation hub for agentic software factories, closing the dispersion gap** (`guide/workflows/agentic-software-factories.md`, `guide/README.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `guide/workflows/spec-first.md`, `guide/ecosystem/agentic-tools.md`): the topic was spread across 7 files that cross-referenced each other without ever converging, so a reader asking "how do I build a software factory with Claude Code" had to read `agentic-tools.md`, `third-party-tools.md`, `spec-first.md`, `methodologies.md`, `ai-ecosystem.md`, `agent-teams.md` and `ultimate-guide.md` in no particular order. The new page is an orientation hub, not a rewrite: all detail stays where it is. It carries a six-level spectrum (single session, `/batch`, native Agent Teams, dynamic-workflows, plan-pipeline, third-party orchestrators, closed factory) with the cost and the upgrade signal for each level, a reading map organized by intent rather than by file, and the **decision tree that did not exist**: when does a closed software factory (Factory.ai, Blitzy, Maleus, Devin) actually beat native Agent Teams plus `/batch` plus dynamic-workflows, which already cover most of the same need at no extra cost. Trees already existed for multi-instance vs single-instance (`ultimate-guide.md:20320`) and for agent teams vs other patterns (`agent-teams.md` section 7), but not for this choice, which is the expensive one. The verdict is stated rather than hedged (for a small team, almost never) and explicitly labelled as this guide's editorial judgment rather than a measured threshold, since no comparative cost study exists to settle it; the reasoning behind it is checkable, namely six sourced production use cases for Agent Teams against zero independently verified deployments with metrics for any closed platform. A self-host branch pointing at OpenHands was added so the choice does not read as binary. The governance checklist extends the four questions at `spec-first.md:970-975` with a fifth drawn from this session's Fusion analysis: is the verification feature the README advertises actually wired into the code path that runs in production, or only imported `import type` and never instantiated. Closes with a case-study callout on unbounded agentic velocity using the measured Fusion figures (727,279 lines in under 4 months, a 19,328-line `executor.ts`, 94% of commits from one identity, dual storage backend in parallel, a 986-line adversarial verification module built, tested and never wired), making the point that agentic velocity without architecture produces debt at a speed the industry has not had to handle before.

- **Fusion evaluated from source, 4/5, integrated as a case study only** (`docs/resource-evaluations/fusion-multi-agent-orchestrator.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): source-level evaluation of [Runfusion/Fusion](https://github.com/Runfusion/Fusion) at commit `8fe122d77` (MIT, pnpm TypeScript monorepo, 12 packages, 18 bundled plugins, `@runfusion/fusion` on npm), a multi-agent orchestrator marketed as "a software factory". Every claim was checked against code rather than documentation, which changed the verdict twice. **The one idea worth taking**: `packages/engine/src/mission-verification.ts` (986 lines) implements double-checkout adversarial verification, where the read-only AI judge is explicitly advisory rather than authoritative (lines 4-6), a real disposable checkout is materialized via `fs.mkdtemp` + `git worktree add --detach` (lines 338-341), and an agent-supplied regression test must **FAIL** on a second disposable checkout at the merge-base before it can pass (line 26, verdict at line 555), which mechanically kills `expect(true).toBe(true)` as a way to turn a task green; three typed verdicts (`pass | fail | inconclusive`, line 63) keep a flaky CI from being read as broken code (line 581). **That module is dead code in production**: `mission-execution-loop.ts` imports it `import type` only (lines 28, 112), the real implementation is imported by three test files and nothing else, `verificationCapability` is never wired at the single production instantiation point (`runtimes/in-process-runtime.ts:543-570`), and the code leaves behavioral assertions failed when it is absent (line 813); 5 commits, untouched since 2026-06-19. Wired-vs-advertised audit of 9 headline features: missions/autopilot (`in-process-runtime.ts:537`), shared branch groups, multi-node (`project-manager.ts:224`), `spawn_agent` and `delegate_task` are real; evals are gated behind `evalsView`, absent from `DEFAULT_ON_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` (`core/src/experimental-features.ts:25`) and therefore off by default; "Signals" and "Connectors" from the README have no referent in code. **Health, the disqualifying number**: first commit 2026-03-25 (under 4 months old), 11,333 commits on main, 32 contributors displayed but gsxdsm plus bot identities account for **10,665 commits, 94%**, second human at 3.3%, and over the last 30 days gsxdsm at 2,203 against 55 for the runner-up. Bus factor 1. Velocity peaked in May (4,328 commits) and is declining (2,617 in June, ~1,900 on July's run rate). **Scale**: 727,279 lines excluding tests and node_modules, `executor.ts` alone at 19,328 lines, plus a dual storage backend maintained in parallel (`sqlite-adapter.ts` + `db.ts` alongside `postgres/`, every store duplicated: `agent-store.ts` at 122.7 KB beside `async-agent-store.ts`, `async-mission-store-queries.ts` at 85.8 KB), which explains the flood of `pg-*` changesets while `ROADMAP.md` still lists that migration as "planned". **Security is weak by default on all three layers**: agent execution defaults to `sandbox.backend = native` with bubblewrap opt-in and Linux-only, the heartbeat path grants write/edit/bash by system prompt (`agent-heartbeat.ts:595`) while the real fail-closed readonly allowlist (`workflow-step-tool-policy.ts:4-25`) only covers workflow-step gate nodes, and plugins run in-process with AI scan and signature verification both optional and off. Decision: **integrate as a case study, do not recommend as a tool**. Three angles carried forward: the double-checkout pattern deserves its own guide section as the concrete answer to the "decorative CI" trap already at `guide/workflows/spec-first.md:979-988` and to Refute-or-Promote (arXiv:2604.19049); Fusion as a market entry in `agentic-tools.md` with an explicit bus-factor caveat; and the involuntary lesson, that a single developer with agents shipping 727K lines in under 4 months also ships documentation describing a product that does not quite exist, tested-but-unwired code, and two storage backends in parallel, which is a case study in **agentic velocity bounded by no architecture** that nobody else is documenting. Two method notes logged: the local RTK token-compression proxy silently truncates git output to 50 lines and produced a false first-commit date on the first pass (re-run through `rtk proxy`), and `import type` erases at compile time so it proves no runtime wiring, a distinction that separated Fusion's advertised verification layer from its actual behavior and is likely a generalized trap across this market. Also produced `claudedocs/perplexity-prompt-agentic-software-factories.md`, a three-stage Perplexity research prompt (market sweep excluding the 35+ tools already covered, adversarial-verification deep dive, negative-experience sweep) calibrated on these findings, with bus factor as the primary elimination criterion.

- **Three missing agent orchestrators/frameworks added: MetaGPT, Symphony, Paperclip** (`guide/ecosystem/agentic-tools.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): reading Liza's own competitive survey ([mas-survey.md](https://github.com/liza-mas/liza/blob/24b35b90801450fb8b0599358efccdda3810145d/specs/architecture/competition-survey/mas-survey.md)) surfaced three projects the guide had never covered, while confirming that BMAD, gstack, GSD, CrewAI, Ruflo, OpenSpec, Spec Kit, Kiro, LangGraph and AutoGen were already handled. **§3.5 MetaGPT** (69,384 stars, MIT, Python): the original `Code = SOP(Team)` framework with five fixed roles, framed as a reference architecture rather than a dependency because the last tagged release is v0.8.1 from April 2024 and the last commit is January 2026, with team attention moved to the hosted MGX product. **§4.4 Symphony** (25,969 stars, Apache-2.0, Elixir): OpenAI's scheduler that watches a Linear board, creates one workspace per issue, spawns a Codex agent, and collects proof of work (CI status, PR review, complexity analysis, walkthrough video) before landing; notable for shipping [SPEC.md](https://github.com/openai/symphony/blob/main/SPEC.md) as the product and telling readers to have their own agent build the implementation, and carrying an explicit "low-key engineering preview" warning with no tagged release and no commit since June 9, 2026. **§4.5 Paperclip** (73,770 stars, 13,731 forks, MIT, TypeScript): org charts, budgets, approval gates and per-agent cost tracking over any runtime ("if it can receive a heartbeat, it's hired"), created March 2, 2026 and shipping weekly (v2026.707.0), positioned by its own README as "if OpenClaw is an employee, Paperclip is the company", which places it above rather than against Claude Code. Each entry documents where it stops: MetaGPT assumes SOP compliance and retries rather than preventing, Symphony has the agent self-certify with no review loop, and Paperclip governs who may act and how much they may spend but explicitly not how work is done inside a session. Also updated the spectrum diagram with an "agent orchestrator" tier, added three rows plus a staleness caveat to the comparison matrix, added four rows to the situation-to-tool guide, refreshed the stale CrewAI count (52K to 55K), and added `metagpt_tool` / `symphony_tool` / `paperclip_tool` anchors to reference.yaml. All figures re-derived from the GitHub API on 2026-07-15, none taken from the survey.

- **Liza evaluation updated with a fact-check of the project's own competitive survey, and converted to English** (`docs/resource-evaluations/liza-mas-framework.md`): the 3/5 score and the "mention as reference architecture in spec-first.md" decision are unchanged, since both rested on architecture (Go supervisors, circuit breaker, behavioral contract) verified against the repo rather than on the author's comparisons. Added a section documenting two problems with the survey. Its seven-category taxonomy produces a bucket of one ("Behavioral enforcement systems (Liza). One entry.", "Enterprise trust remains unsolved by everyone except Liza"), which is positioning rather than a finding. More measurably, it understates every competitor's traction in the same direction: gstack ~100.7k vs 122,026 actual, Paperclip "14k, just launched" vs 73,770, GSD 37k vs 64,742, CrewAI 45k vs 55,565, BMAD ~45.2k vs 50,631, MetaGPT 64k vs 69,384 (all `gh api`, 2026-07-15). Staleness explains part of it, but not the uniform direction, and the survey itself mixes figures dated a month apart in one matrix (gstack at 2026-05-22, BMAD at 2026-04-20). The practical effect is that its "Liza = Early vs GSD = 37k" row understates a gap that is really 322 against 64,742. Credit recorded where due: the per-competitor analysis is technically argued, and its critique of GSD (LLM-on-LLM orchestration has no hard trust boundary between orchestrator and subagent, versus Go-on-LLM) is reusable independently of Liza. Verdict: treat the survey as a lead list of projects to investigate, never as a source of figures. Two survey claims were checked and confirmed (MetaGPT's release really has been frozen since v0.8.1/April 2024; Symphony really is Apache-2.0, resolving the survey's own "some sources say MIT" hedge) and one marked unverifiable (the ~200-line goal doc that allegedly produced a full three-tier app, whose artifacts the survey admits live in a non-public repo). Confidence downgraded in wording from "Medium (architecture unique and verified)" to note the skewed self-reported comparisons. Separately, the file body was translated from French to English to match the repo's language rule and the 127-of-164 English majority in `docs/resource-evaluations/`; it was still untracked, so no committed content changed language.

- **IA-QA CLI evaluated and rejected (2/5, watch only)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/ia-qa-cli-llm-testing.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`): evaluation of `@ia-qa/cli` v1.0.4 (Jean-Christophe Jamet, announced on LinkedIn 2026-07-15), a zero-dependency shell client exposing 148 QA/LLM tools from ia-qa.com, pitched at agents with shell access (Claude Code, Copilot CLI). Scored 3/5 on the announcement, downgraded to **2/5 after hands-on testing**. The 148-tool count is honest (verified against `GET /mcp?full=1`), but the package is 17.8 KB across 3 files and its own header comment states it "carries NO business logic" and runs everything on the hosted server, so every input (prompts, source, PII) is POSTed to a third party with no signup, no data processing agreement, and no retention policy. Measured three primitives against ground truth rather than trusting claims: `count_tokens` is literally `chars/4` and underestimates by **-35% on JavaScript and -23% on accented French** versus real `cl100k_base` (verified with tiktoken), erring in the unsafe direction and propagating into `estimate_llm_cost`, `context_window_check`, and `token_budget_calculator`, with a second error layer for Claude users since cl100k is the GPT tokenizer. `prompt_injection_scan` is regex matching: it caught 3/3 textbook payloads (system override, context exfiltration, DAN) but flagged a security *article about* injections as critical (false positive) and passed base64 and leetspeak payloads as clean (false negatives), unchanged across all three `sensitivity` levels, despite its description advertising "encoding tricks" detection. `hallucination_check` self-declares as word-overlap and non-semantic. Credit recorded where due: the 336-line client is well engineered (`writeSecureTmp` uses `wx` + mode `0o600` against symlink pre-creation, `SECRET_PARAMS` is exact-match with a comment on why substring matching breaks, stderr warning before sending secrets to a non-default server, `--<param>-file` to survive Windows `npx` argv truncation, no install scripts, zero deps), and the server-side tool descriptions are honest about their limits, so the overselling lives in the LinkedIn post rather than in the product. Not integrated: nothing fills a guide gap (`security-hardening.md` covers prompt injection, `third-party-tools.md` covers mcp2cli as the generic MCP-to-CLI solution, `ai-ecosystem.md` covers promptfoo, `ai-unit-economics.md` covers token cost) and recommending it would mean routing reader source through a third-party host. Two teaching points logged for later, unattached to the tool: a CLI advertising "zero dependencies, no signup" can still be a network client (17 KB cannot hold 148 tools, checkable via `npm view`), and `chars/4` token estimation fails on code by roughly a third. Re-evaluate if local execution ships, the server source is published, or a real tokenizer replaces the heuristic. Also corrected the index footer, which claimed "121 évaluations" against 162 files actually on disk.

- **Two teaching points from the IA-QA rejection carried into the guide** (`guide/security/data-privacy.md` §Risk 7, `guide/ops/ai-unit-economics.md` §"Do not estimate tokens by string length"): the tool was rejected at 2/5, but two findings generalized beyond it and were integrated as patterns, deliberately without naming the product (a day-0 free project by a solo dev does not belong by name in a "Known Risks" section; the named analysis stays in the evaluation file, where it is balanced with credit). **Risk 7, the local-looking network client**: a package can advertise "zero dependencies, no signup" truthfully and still POST every input to a server you do not control, because a thin HTTP client genuinely has no dependencies. Documents the arithmetic tell (`npm view <pkg> --json` unpacked size against advertised functionality: 17 KB across 3 files cannot hold 148 analysis tools, it holds a `fetch` call) and a one-liner to read the source from the tarball before running it. The section's core argument is that **MCP mode is categorically worse than CLI mode**: in CLI mode a human picks each input, which is a discipline problem a careful team can hold; in MCP mode the agent picks, and the agent has the codebase in context, so it will hand a proprietary file to a hosted `count_tokens` without anyone approving that specific call. Client-side hardening (temp files in `0600`, secret-param warnings) defends against argv leaks and local attacks, not against an agent deciding what to send. This framing came from a second independent evaluation session run against an unrelated production codebase and is sharper than the data-transfer framing the evaluation opened with. **Token estimation**: `chars/4` measured against real `cl100k_base` at +10% on English prose but **-35% on JavaScript and -23% on accented French**, erring in the unsafe direction (reports that a payload fits when it does not, so a budget guard silently passes what it exists to stop), with cl100k being OpenAI's tokenizer so a Claude-targeted estimate stacks a second error. Includes the subtler second-order variant: counting the raw user message while sending a prompt assembled from that message plus system header, role prefixes, and instruction block, which under-counts by everything the wrapper adds and stays invisible in tests that skip formatting. Both points were confirmed present in shipping production code during the second session (a `chars/4` helper guarding a hard provider limit on French user input, plus the count-the-wrong-string bug), which is what moved them from observation to guide content; that codebase is private, is not cited, and the guide sections use reconstructed examples. Both sections indexed in `machine-readable/reference.yaml` (`data_privacy_local_looking_client`, `ai_unit_economics_token_estimation`), YAML validated and anchors verified against the actual headings; the landing search index was rebuilt with `pnpm build:search` so Cmd+K resolves the two new entries.

- **Local CLI quiz (`quiz/`) category 16 realigned with the live web quiz, README counters corrected** (`quiz/questions/16-agent-harness-context.yaml`, `quiz/questions/17-team-metrics.yaml`, `README.md`, `quiz/README.md`): the bundled standalone CLI quiz tool and the live web quiz at cc.bruniaux.com/quiz had diverged on category 16, the CLI tracked "Team Metrics for AI-Augmented Engineering" (12 questions) while the web quiz already covered "Agent Harness & Context" (40 questions) under the same category number. Per user decision, the CLI now adopts the web's topic for category 16 (40 questions converted from the web's markdown source, `doc_reference` preserved per question), and Team Metrics moves intact to a new category 17. Local CLI quiz total goes from 334 to 374 questions across 17 categories. README.md and quiz/README.md badges/counts updated from the stale 271/159 and "10 Topic Categories" to the real 374/17. Separately, 55 new questions were added directly to the live web quiz (cc.bruniaux.com/quiz, `claude-code-ultimate-guide-landing` repo) covering recent Claude Code releases (v2.1.186-v2.1.204) and recently added guide sections, bringing that quiz to 401 questions across 16 categories; this was pushed by a parallel session during the same work window.

- **Full-guide offline exports refreshed and re-surfaced, EN + FR** (`whitepapers/guide-export.qmd`, `guide-export-fr.qmd`, `README.md`, landing `HeroBanner.astro`): the ~700-page PDF/EPUB export answering issue #60 had drifted (GitHub Release stuck at `guide-export-v3.38.3` since April 4 while `VERSION` was 3.41.1, because the automation cron was dead and the qmd cover version was hard-coded). Bumped both qmd covers to 3.41.1, rebuilt the EN PDF (17.2 MB) + EPUB (715 KB) locally with the Bold Guy Typst template, and published Release `guide-export-v3.41.1` marked latest so the existing landing badge and README links auto-resolve to the current build. Replaced the two low-contrast "full guide" hero badges (grey `#555`, easy to miss) with a dedicated download block on the landing (accent-bordered, `📖 Full guide (offline)`, EN and FR grouped) and expanded the README Downloads section from two EN badges to four EN/FR badges with flag labels. The FR side is now live: `guide/ultimate-guide.fr.md` was re-translated against the current EN guide (25,798 lines, up from 24,039), rendered to a 592-page PDF (16.4 MB) and EPUB (742 KB) with the Bold Guy Typst template, and uploaded to Release `guide-export-v3.41.1`, which now carries all four assets (EN pdf/epub + FR pdf/epub). The `releases/latest/download/guide-export-fr.{pdf,epub}` links resolve (verified 200), so the README and landing FR buttons work.

- **TDD workflow hook-config format corrected** (`guide/workflows/tdd-with-claude.md`): the PostToolUse example used the obsolete flat `{matcher, command}` shape, which current Claude Code silently ignores; replaced with the nested `hooks: [{ type: command, command }]` form. Surfaced while fact-checking a batch of portfolio TDD and security articles against this guide, where the articles already used the correct nested format.

- **Quiz fact-check audit against the live guide tree** (`claude-code-ultimate-guide-landing/src/content/questions/`): a 84-agent fact-check pass over all 346 live quiz questions (cc.bruniaux.com/quiz) against the current guide, official Anthropic docs, and live web search, triggered by a request to cross-reference the quiz with the guide's post-reorg file layout. 70 stale `doc_reference.file` paths were corrected (the guide moved several files into `core/`, `security/`, `roles/`, `ecosystem/`, and `ops/` subdirectories since these questions were written, e.g. `guide/core/architecture.md` to `guide/core/architecture.md`). 11 questions were flagged with a wrong "correct" answer, independently re-verified by 2 skeptic agents each, and 10 of the 11 were confirmed and corrected (option text and explanation rewritten), covering things like the nonexistent `/execute` command, `~/.claude/mcp.json` (Claude Code reads `~/.claude.json`, not that path), `${workspaceFolder}` (a VS Code convention, not supported here), and a `systemMessage`/`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` mix-up. Two YAML frontmatter bugs surfaced by the `pnpm build` Zod-schema gate were fixed (unquoted colons inside option values breaking YAML parsing). 64 new question drafts and category-coverage proposals were written to `claudedocs/quiz-audit-2026-07-08/` in the guide repo for manual review; none of those were auto-applied per the task's scope. Build passes across all 346 questions; nothing was committed or pushed in the landing repo.

- **Spec-driven agentic pipelines: BMAD-METHOD, OpenHands, spec-kitty, Agent Orchestrator, and the "AI software factory" category** (`guide/workflows/spec-first.md`, `guide/ecosystem/agentic-tools.md`, `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/`): triggered by a competitive-landscape research pass on Maleus (formerly misheard as "Solario" in a meetup transcript), Adrien Maret's Paris-based full-cycle spec-to-deploy platform. Added OpenHands (`agentic-tools.md` §2.4, 79,900+ stars verified via `gh api`) as the open source equivalent to Devin, with its dependency-graph parallel execution (Tier 0/Tier 1 sub-agent spawning) and integrator-merge pattern. Added BMAD-METHOD (50,200+ stars) and spec-kitty (1,400+ stars) to `spec-first.md`'s tool-integration section: BMAD-METHOD's 19+ role-specific planning agents versus spec-kitty's git-worktree isolation with kanban-tracked merge gates and audit trail. Added a new "Full-cycle AI software factories" subsection covering Maleus, Factory.ai, Blitzy ($200M/$1.4B valuation, Northzone-led, May 2026, verified against SiliconANGLE/BusinessWire), and Devin as a distinct commercial category, framed around four governance questions (deterministic gate vs LLM self-grading, stop-the-line escalation, audit-trail traceability, spec staying authoritative after first generation) rather than a feature checklist. Added Agent Orchestrator (`third-party-tools.md`, right after Conductor, 8,100+ stars in 5 months, Apache-2.0) as the open source, cross-platform equivalent to Conductor, 23 supported agent CLIs vs Conductor's 2, plus a PostHog telemetry-by-default note and a correction of a secondary-source claim: the "CI retry twice then escalate" mechanism attributed to the project in cross-referenced research does not appear in its README, architecture doc, or status doc as of July 2026, and was not carried into the guide. Four new resource-evaluation files score BMAD-METHOD (4/5), OpenHands (4/5), spec-kitty (3/5), and Agent Orchestrator (3/5) against the existing 1-5 grid, all star counts and license fields verified live via `gh api` rather than secondary sources.

- **Liza MAS framework added as OSS governance reference architecture** (`guide/workflows/spec-first.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/liza-mas-framework.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): the "Full-cycle AI software factories" section listed four closed/managed commercial products (Maleus, Factory.ai, Blitzy, Devin) but no open source counterpart that answers the four governance questions in the open. Added [Liza](https://github.com/liza-mas/liza) (Apache-2.0, 320 stars, single-author, verified via `gh api` 2026-07-12) as that counterpart: Go supervisors that enforce state transitions, role boundaries, merge authority and TDD gates mechanically rather than by prompt, adversarial doer/reviewer pairs per task, an auditable YAML blackboard, and an explicit circuit breaker, the one OSS example that documents the stop-the-line mechanism (governance question 2) I had flagged as rarely documented. Framed strictly as a reference architecture, not a dependency to adopt, given tiny adoption and no third-party production evidence. New evaluation file scores it 3/5 and keeps it distinct from the earlier `liza-mas-token-saving-cli-tools.md` (2026-06-10) that rejected the org's satellite CLIs (scip-search, mdtoc, functional-clusters, stacklit-cli), a different object. Fact-checked and corrected two undercounts in Liza's own README against live API: it cites BMAD "~45.2k stars" (actual 50,374) and CrewAI "45k" (actual 55,377), and its "L4 alongside BMAD/BEADS" positioning is a single IBM-exec quote, not an independent benchmark, both flagged in the evaluation.

- **Empirical backing for deterministic gates + multi-agent cost figures + Keli attribution fix** (`guide/workflows/spec-first.md`, `guide/ops/ai-unit-economics.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/liza-mas-framework.md`): a Perplexity deep-research pass surfaced peer-review-adjacent evidence that was missing from the governance section. Added *Refute-or-Promote* ([arXiv:2604.19049](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.19049), Abhinav Agarwal, verified live against arxiv.org) to governance question 1 in spec-first.md: a 31-day adversarial defect-discovery campaign, agents assigned to refute not confirm, mandatory empirical (PoC) gate, ~79% of 171 candidates killed, 4 real CVEs, and the decisive anecdote that ten LLM reviewers unanimously endorsed a Bleichenbacher padding oracle that did not exist, caught only by the empirical gate. This converts the "deterministic gate beats LLM self/peer grading" claim from assertion to sourced evidence. Added multi-agent token-cost orders of magnitude to `ai-unit-economics.md` (3-10x single-agent per naive-multi-agent task, 30-80% clawback via contracts/compression/KV-cache sharing), flagged as vendor-internal and analytical, not peer-reviewed. Corrected a factual error I introduced earlier in the Liza evaluation: Soufiane Keli is VP Software Engineering at Octo Technology (Accenture), not IBM; Perplexity independently confirmed no formal L1-L5 maturity model is published by him or anywhere, reinforcing the "do not cite as external validation" flag. Note: the earlier Liza changelog entry above still says "IBM-exec quote", left as-is as the historical record; the evaluation file carries the correction.

- **machine-readable/reference.yaml sync + BMAD duplication fix** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `guide/core/methodologies.md`, `guide/workflows/spec-first.md`): the additions above had not been indexed. Added 15 new keys (bmad_method_*, spec_kitty_*, openhands_*, ai_software_factories_*) with anchor-verified links. Found and fixed a real duplication risk the user flagged: `methodologies.md` already documents BMAD-METHOD as a Tier 1 methodology (constitution.md, when to use/avoid) but had no link to the newly added installation instructions in `spec-first.md`, and its only source link pointed to a Claude-Code-specific fork (`24601/BMAD-AT-CLAUDE`) rather than the canonical `bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD` repo. Added bidirectional cross-links between the two sections and the canonical repo URL with verified star count. Also caught and fixed two stale line-number references in reference.yaml (`resource_evaluations_appendix` pointed to `ultimate-guide.md:20886`, an unrelated llms.txt discussion; the real Appendix C is at line 26294. `resource_evaluations_readme_section` pointed to `README.md:307`, mid-quiz-section; the actual "151 Resource Evaluations" heading is at line 354) and flagged a larger pre-existing gap without fixing it: `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`'s index table lists 43 rows against 160 actual evaluation files on disk, a discrepancy that predates this session and needs a dedicated audit pass.

- **Edgee Compressor V2 documented, cross-referenced with RTK, plus new prompt-compression/gateway/methodology coverage** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`, `guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`, `guide/ops/ai-unit-economics.md`): the existing Edgee entry described the pre-V2 generic "composable edge layer" positioning. Replaced it with the actual three-layer Compressor V2 architecture (brevity, Tool Surface Reduction, tool result trimming) from Edgee's July 2, 2026 blog post, its explicit RTK lineage for the trimming layer, and a sourced critique of the post's methodology: SWE-bench Lite's resolution rate is never measured, the "50%" headline traces closest to brevity's raw aggregate rather than a combined end-to-end measurement, and the n=6/n=8 sign-test sample sizes are flagged against their significance ceiling (a perfect 6-of-6 score is the only outcome that clears p<0.05 at n=6). Added three previously uncovered academic prompt-compression techniques to context-engineering-tools.md §4 (Selective Context, AutoCompressors/Gisting, RECOMP), each flagged research-only vs. production-adopted per source verification. Added LiteLLM and GPTCache to §5 (AI Gateways), and a KV-cache-compression research-frontier note (eviction/quantization/low-rank families, ChunkKV, TurboQuant) to §8. Added Klavis AI/Strata and Arcade.dev to the MCP tool-surface-reduction table in `mcp-vs-cli.md`, both with vendor-reported figures flagged as unverified. Added a new §6 to `ai-unit-economics.md`, "How to read a vendor's cost-reduction claim" (paired vs. unpaired comparisons, sign test vs. paired t-test, the significance ceiling at small n, reading bootstrap confidence intervals, median vs. aggregate, and a checklist), generalizing the Edgee critique into a reusable framework for evaluating any vendor's benchmark claims.

- **Edgee production numbers cross-checked against the vendor's own docs, plus corrected Klavis/Strata and Arcade.dev benchmark figures** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`, `guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`): a follow-up WebSearch/WebFetch pass on the Edgee critique above (triggered by cross-checking a Perplexity research summary against primary sources) surfaced a second, separate set of numbers on Edgee's own docs page (`edgee.ai/docs/introduction/why-edgee`, distinct from the blog post): production averages across real customer traffic put brevity at ~6.5% and tool result trimming at ~19%, against the blog's 6-task benchmark figures of ~30% and ~10% respectively, with tool surface reduction at ~25% but still labeled "in development." The same docs page answers the resolution-rate gap with "zero measurable drift on SWE-Bench Verified samples," a claim with no sample size, no definition of "measurable," and no confidence interval, added to the guide as a documented example of an unquantified rebuttal to a statistically grounded critique. Separately, direct WebFetch verification of `edgee-ai/compression-lab`'s README confirmed it contains zero mentions of SWE-Bench Verified, drift, or resolution rate, ruling out that the production claim lives in the benchmark repo itself. Also corrected the Klavis AI/Strata row in `mcp-vs-cli.md` from a vague "+13% accuracy" figure to the actual named benchmark (MCPMark: +15.2% pass@1 vs. the official GitHub MCP server, +13.4% vs. Notion, 85-100x token reduction), and added Arcade.dev's vendor comparison against Composio (7,426 vs. 747,083 tokens across 8 CRM queries) which had previously been described only qualitatively. LLMLingua-2's exact figures (2x-5x compression, 1.6x-2.9x end-to-end latency speedup, ACL 2024 Findings) and ChunkKV's confirmed 26.5% throughput gain (arXiv 2502.00299) were independently verified against primary sources during the same pass.

- **Context engineering pages refreshed against July 2026 research** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md`, `guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`, `guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`, `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): synced against two dated research passes (context-engineering-concepts-2026-07.md, context-engineering-tools-panorama-2026-07.md). Added the disputed authorship of the term "context engineering" (Karpathy vs. Dex Horthy/12-Factor Agents' "dumb zone"), a refinement note on context rot (NIAH underestimates degradation on semantically ambiguous queries, per the MonitorBench 98.6%→88% data point), a cross-reference from the dynamic-context section to the already-documented Managed Agents brain/hands/session-log architecture (`ai-ecosystem.md` §14) plus the April 2026 Anthropic posts on it, and a new research subsection covering ACON, Less Context Better Agents, AMA-Bench, Agent Memory characterization, ContextBudget, Classifier Context Rot, Context Kubernetes, and Recursive Language Models, each tagged with its actual confidence level (single-paper claim, prototype-only, independently reproduced, etc). Added a new Optical/Visual Context Compression pattern (DeepSeek-OCR lineage) cross-linked to a new **pxpipe** tool profile. Added **Cloudflare Code Mode MCP** (99.9% tool-schema-loading reduction via a two-meta-tool code-execution pattern), **TOON** (Token-Oriented Object Notation, format-dependent gains), and a new "ghost tokens" / context-quality-after-compaction concept (`alexgreensh/token-optimizer`). Refreshed GitHub star counts via the tools' own verification method (`gh api`, 2026-07-07): RTK 446→69,042, Headroom 43,000→57,223 (plus its org move from `chopratejas/headroom` to `headroomlabs-ai/headroom`), context-mode 14,149→18,654 (12→17 supported platforms), cc-statistics 87→109. Added a new MCP protocol roadmap subsection (stateless core, Extensions, Tasks, deprecation policy, per the 2026-07-28 release candidate) and the NSA's June 2026 MCP security guidance to `mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`. Every rapid-growth or self-reported figure (RTK's 2.8x star jump, Headroom's "$700K saved" claim) is flagged with its verification caveat rather than stated as fact, matching the source research's own hedging.

- **Audience pages published on the landing** (`docs/for-product-managers.md`, `for-tech-leads.md`, `for-cto.md`, `for-cio-ceo.md`): the four role pages were only readable on GitHub. The landing build script (`prepare-guide-content.mjs`) now pulls them from `docs/` and serves them at `/guide/for-product-managers/`, `/guide/for-tech-leads/`, `/guide/for-cto/`, and `/guide/for-cio-ceo/`, with a "For Your Role" section on the `/guide/` index, sitemap and RSS entries, and Cmd+K search coverage. Deep links like `ultimate-guide.md#35-team-configuration-at-scale` now resolve to the correct chapter page instead of landing on the chapter index (new `resolveUltimateGuideAnchors` pass, applied to all served pages).

### Fixed

- **Broken YAML frontmatter on GitHub for 6 skill templates** (`examples/skills/{autoresearch,canary,investigate,qa,plan-pipeline/ceo-review,plan-pipeline/eng-review}/SKILL.md`): unquoted colons inside `description:` values ("Strategic product gate: challenge the brief...") made GitHub's YAML parser fail with "mapping values are not allowed in this context", showing an error banner instead of the rendered frontmatter. Quoted all six descriptions and validated with a YAML parse.
- **check-landing-sync.sh broken since the Astro migration** (`scripts/check-landing-sync.sh`): four of six checks still grepped the deleted `index.html`/`quiz/index.html`, and `set -e` killed the script mid-run on the first failed grep, so the version, quiz, guide-lines, and CC-version checks never executed (the script also referenced a `$QUESTIONS_COUNT` variable that was never computed). Rewrote all checks against the Astro sources: guide version from `AnnouncementBanner.astro`, quiz count from `questions/*/*.md` compared against `quiz/index.astro`, `HeroBanner.astro`, and the `index.astro` meta description, guide-lines against the "NK+ lines" claim with a 2K tolerance, CC version from the first `releases.ts` entry plus an exactly-one-`latest: true` flag check. Dropped the GitHub stars check (the landing fetches stars live client-side, there is no static value to sync). First run immediately caught a real drift: the landing meta description claimed a 346-question quiz against 330 actual questions, fixed in the landing repo.
- **Recap cards deployment sync (portfolio + landing)**: neither the July 2 FR pass nor the July 3 EN pass had been deployed; the landing kept serving the stale hashed PDFs. Deployed the 24 corrected cards (10 FR + 14 EN) with new hashed filenames to `florian-portfolio/public/guides/recap-cards/`, rebuilt all 6 series ZIPs (T/M/C × FR/EN), updated `CARD_HASHES_FR/EN` and the 6 `hashedZip` entries in the landing `recap-cards-data.ts`, and refreshed the `guides.mjs` email-link manifest (also added the previously missing `recap-conception.fr/en` entries). Also added the landing repo to `ALLOWED_PATHS` in `.claude/settings.json`, it was the only documented sync target missing from the hook allowlist (portfolio was already there).
- **Content freshness pass on 14 EN recap cards** (`whitepapers/recap-cards/en/`): same audit as the July 2 FR pass, all 10 FR problems confirmed present in EN and fixed (dead `autoApproveTools`/top-level `allowedTools` keys replaced with `permissions.allow` in t04/c06/t06, `.claude/commands/` updated to `.claude/skills/` in c03/t09/t10/t06, fictitious `--context` flag removed from 01/04, permission-mode canonical names plus `PreCompact`/`SessionEnd` events in 03/m11). The EN pass additionally caught 6 findings the FR audit missed, verified against `claude --help` and `guide/core/settings-reference.md`: fictitious `--no-stream` flag (01, t02), fictitious `--task-manage` flag presented as native CC "since v2.1.19" (m07, it is a SuperClaude framework flag; the real behavior is Tasks API on by default since v2.1.142), non-existent `{"vim": true}` key (01, real key `editorMode: "vim"`), `spinnerVerbs.mode: "add"` (t06, valid values `replace`/`append`), non-existent `sandbox.network.policy` key (t16), and a settings-style `allowedTools:` snippet (c08). These 6 are still present in the FR counterparts. All 14 EN PDFs rebuilt. Full breakdown in `whitepapers/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **WP03 FR stale malicious-author/skill counters** (`whitepapers/fr/03-securite.qmd`, wp-version 1.4.0 → 1.4.1): the July 2 EN freshness pass had flagged these counts as stale in both languages but only fixed the EN file. FR still stated 5 confirmed malicious authors and 314+/341+ malicious skills. Corrected against `threat-db.yaml` v2.23.0: 6 confirmed authors (sakaen736jih was missing), hightower6eu alone at 677 VirusTotal-confirmed skills, ClawHavoc campaign grown from 341 to 1,184+ confirmed entries by March 1, 2026. PDF and EPUB rebuilt.
- **Broken data_privacy anchors in machine-readable index** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`): the late-June rewrite of `guide/security/data-privacy.md` renumbered sections (Known Risks 3→2, Protective Measures 4→3, Enterprise Considerations 6→5) and removed the retention-tiers detail and IP sections, leaving 10 of 14 `data_privacy_*` anchors dead. Fixed all section-number anchors, corrected the TL;DR slug (`tl-dr` → `tldr`, GitHub slugger drops the semicolon without a dash), completed the truncated Risk 6 slug, repointed `data_privacy_zdr` to the Enterprise ZDR section and `data_privacy_checklist` to the new Quick Audit Checklist, removed the two entries whose target sections no longer exist (`retention_policies`, `ip_considerations`), and refreshed `data_privacy_description`. Documented the Cmd+K search index rebuild (`pnpm build:search`, `scripts/build-guide-index.mjs`) in a new section of `docs/workflows/landing-sync.md`, which the workflow referenced implicitly but never described.

- **Content freshness pass on all 13 EN whitepapers** (`whitepapers/en/00-12`): the FR pass surfaced a suspicion that EN carried the same drift, confirmed by the same 13-agent audit method. Same class of gaps found: WP04 and WP07 EN had the identical "sub-agents cannot spawn sub-agents (depth=1)" factual error, WP08 EN was missing the same 450-line Advanced Orchestration Patterns section, WP11 EN was missing the same Agentic Metrics section, WP12 EN was missing the same 4 evaluation subsections. Every fix was independently verified line-by-line post-edit after an earlier FR fix on WP00 was found to have missed its series-list correction despite a clean version bump. `whitepapers/en/05-team.qmd` confirmed untracked by git (blanket `whitepapers/` gitignore, unlike its siblings), flagged not fixed. Full breakdown in `whitepapers/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Content freshness pass on 10 FR recap cards** (`whitepapers/recap-cards/fr/`): dead `settings.json` keys (`autoApproveTools`, top-level `allowedTools`) replaced with the canonical `permissions.allow` in t04/c06/t06; `.claude/commands/` references updated to `.claude/skills/` (CC 2.1.3 merge) in c03/t09/t10; fictitious `--context` CLI flag removed from 01/04; permission mode canonical names, `PreCompact`/`SessionEnd` events, and a factual error (Shift+Tab×2 activates Plan Mode, not "Auto-accept all") fixed in 03/m11. All 10 rebuilt.
- **Content freshness pass on all 13 FR whitepapers** (`whitepapers/fr/00-12`): a version-only audit had marked all 13 whitepapers "fresh" (recent version field), but a deep content audit (13 dedicated sub-agents, one per whitepaper, cross-referenced against `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` and `machine-readable/`) found real drift, including two factually wrong claims. WP04 and WP07 both stated sub-agents cannot spawn sub-agents ("depth=1"), outdated since Claude Code v2.1.172 (now up to 5 levels), and both were missing Sonnet 5 as the default model. WP08 was missing an entire "Advanced Orchestration Patterns" section (7 patterns, ~450 lines in the source guide) despite being previously judged up to date. WP11 was missing the whole "Agentic Metrics: What DORA Doesn't Measure" section, the WP's actual core topic. Full breakdown of all 13 corrections in `whitepapers/CHANGELOG.md`.

- **MCP Registry claim in support/CSM agent content** (`guide/workflows/support-csm-agent.md`, `guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`): corrected a false claim that the official MCP Registry doesn't list HubSpot/Zendesk servers. Verified by direct query against `registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers`, which does list several self-published entries. Added the distinction that `modelcontextprotocol/servers` (GitHub repo) is reference-only and defers to the registry for discovery, while registry presence itself signals submission, not vendor endorsement. Kept the existing star-count/commit-recency picks since the registry doesn't expose those signals.
- **Whitepaper count drift across machine-readable index** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `llms-full.txt`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`): three files independently understated the whitepaper count (9, 11, and 10 respectively) against the actual 13 whitepapers (00-12) on disk. Corrected all three to 13, extended `whitepapers_topics` in reference.yaml with the 4 missing topics (learning, budget, team-metrics, agent-engineering), and added a `recap_cards_*` index block since the 57-card recap-cards series had zero entries in reference.yaml.
- **WP11 wp-version mismatch**: `whitepapers/en/11-team-metrics.qmd` had `wp-version: 1.0.0` while the FR counterpart was already at `1.0.1`. Synced EN to `1.0.1` and rebuilt the PDF.
- **audit-whitepapers command mapping table gap** (`.claude/commands/audit-whitepapers.md`): the WP-to-guide-section mapping table stopped at WP10, meaning WP11 (team-metrics) and WP12 (agent-engineering) could never get a content-staleness score from `/audit-whitepapers`. Added both rows.
- **whitepapers/fr/cheatsheet.qmd was not in French**: the "FR" cheatsheet had `lang: en` and English-only content, essentially a stale duplicate of the EN cheatsheet. Rewrote it as an actual French translation, and refreshed both FR and EN cheatsheets with commands and features added since v3.27.6-3.29.2 (`/powerup`, `/ultraplan`, `/rc`, `/mobile`, `/voice`, `/recap`, `/effort`, `/loop`, `/goal`, Ctrl+F, expanded permission modes, unified `skills/` folder structure, Search Tools quick reference). Both bumped to version 3.41.1, wp-version 1.1.0, and rebuilt.

### Added

- **Generative UI category: A2UI vs. MCP Apps vs. Vercel AI SDK vs. MDMA** (`guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md` §7.1): new section covering agent-driven interactive UI output (forms, approvals, actions rendered inside a single chat turn, not a separate artifact), with a comparison table across the four current approaches and a case study on MDMA (MobileReality/mdma). The case study documents what holds up under source audit (a real deterministic validator/fixer pipeline, honest evals measuring 41% bare-prompt success vs. 90.5% with the DSL plus validator) against several overstated claims (no cryptographic guarantee of valid UI despite the 90.5%-not-100% figure, "runs anywhere" not extending to rendering since only a React renderer exists, the default chart component being an HTML table, webhooks only dispatching a UI event with no real HTTP call, "accessible by design" not backed by `aria-invalid`/`aria-live` or keyboard-operable PII-masking controls) and one unresolved functional bug found independently by two audit agents: form validation (`required`/`pattern`/`min`/`max`) is documented with worked examples but never enforced, because the form container is a `<div>` rather than a `<form>` and the submit button never triggers native constraint validation. Added a full evaluation at `docs/resource-evaluations/mdma-evaluation.md` (score 3/5, all claims verified against the local source tree at `/Users/florianbruniaux/Sites/divers-test/mdma` rather than the README alone), indexed in `docs/resource-evaluations/README.md`, and 8 new `deep_dive` entries in `machine-readable/reference.yaml`.
- **Multi-provider code review architecture** (`guide/workflows/multi-provider-code-review.md`): new workflow guide documenting a non-redundant 3-provider PR review setup, based on a mature production pattern: Claude Code Action owns deep semantic review and the merge-blocking gate, a deterministic tool (CodeRabbit or equivalent) owns PASS/FAIL pre-merge checks, a cross-file RAG tool (Greptile or equivalent) owns invariants that span multiple files. Covers role separation, the non-duplication rule across config files, a blocking CI gate script, batching for large PRs, delta-review, cross-tool deduplication, and the known friction of rule drift across the three configs. Added supporting templates: `examples/github-actions/claude-code-review-batched.yml` (domain-split matrix review for PRs over a file-count threshold) and `examples/github-actions/.greptile/` (config.json, rules.md, files.json). Added a `gate` job to `examples/github-actions/claude-code-review.yml` that parses the posted review's Must Fix count and fails the CI check, letting branch protection actually block merge on 🔴 findings instead of only commenting. Indexed in `guide/workflows/README.md` and `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, cross-linked from `guide/workflows/code-review.md`.
- **support-csm-agent.md** (`guide/workflows/support-csm-agent.md`): New workflow guide covering internal (non-client-facing) support/CSM agents built with Claude Code. Documents a 6-level maturity model (L0 reply drafting through L5 CSM pre-call briefing), the human-in-the-loop boundary that separates this pattern from buy-side deflection tools (Decagon, Intercom Fin, Ada), a read-only DB diagnosis pattern, security guardrails, and internal-throughput metrics (draft-to-send edit distance, time to first response) instead of a deflection rate. Cross-linked from `event-driven-agents.md`, `data-privacy.md`, and `team-metrics.md`.
- **HubSpot & Zendesk MCP servers** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`): New "Customer Support & CRM" category documenting `shinzo-labs/hubspot-mcp`, `baryhuang/mcp-hubspot`, and `reminia/zendesk-mcp-server` (verified via GitHub API for star count and last-push date; three lower-signal HubSpot alternatives evaluated and excluded for stale commits). Statistics table and maintainer count updated accordingly.
- **threat-db.yaml v2.23.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`): monthly threat intelligence update via `/update-threat-db`. New malicious skills from Unit 42's OpenClaw supply-chain report (money-radar, letssendit, omnicogg, ai-tradingview-assistant-for-macos, tradingview-ai-indicator-assistant). New CVEs: CVE-2026-50548/50549 (Cursor agent terminal sandbox escape, CVSS 9.8 each, also added to `guide/security/security-hardening.md` CVE table), CVE-2026-32871 (FastMCP OpenAPIProvider SSRF/path traversal), CVE-2026-32625 (LibreChat MCP access control, CVSS 9.6), CVE-2026-0621 (MCP TypeScript SDK ReDoS). New attack technique T033 "Agentjacking" (fake Sentry error injection tricking coding agents into executing attacker code, 85% success rate in disclosure testing). New defensive resources: Akamai's security analysis of the upcoming MCP spec, Microsoft's MCP governance rollout in VS Code/Azure APIM.
- **api-gateway.md** (`guide/ops/api-gateway.md`): New guide on setting up an API gateway (LiteLLM or Portkey) between Claude Code clients and Anthropic's API. Covers virtual keys, per-team budget limits, model allowlists, Prometheus metrics, OTel integration, and production Docker Compose setup. Addresses the P0 enterprise deployment gap (cost control and centralized permissions).
- **WebAssembly MCP tool sandboxing** (`guide/security/sandbox-isolation.md §7b`): New section covering Wassette, wasmcp, whamm, and splicer as an emerging Wasm-based approach to sandboxing MCP tools at the OS level. Includes tool comparison table, Wasmtime CVE caveat, and scope statement (Wasm isolation does not cover cost tracking or audit logs). Based on adversarial deep research (100 agents, 25 claims verified 3-vote).
- **Team-level log aggregation** (`guide/ops/observability.md §10`): New section covering two paths for centralizing Claude Code logs across a team: LiteLLM Gateway (recommended) and JSONL shipping to Loki. Includes OTel collector config for Tempo and Prometheus queries for Grafana dashboards.
- **Settings propagation guide** (`guide/security/enterprise-governance.md §2.3`): New subsection explaining three mechanisms for distributing Claude Code config to a team: shared settings.json in repos, CLAUDE.md hierarchy, and Anthropic Team/Enterprise admin console.
- **PR audit trail** (`guide/ops/ai-traceability.md`): New section covering what to capture at PR creation time, a PreToolUse session logger hook, a GitHub Actions workflow that uploads audit artifacts with 90-day retention, and a compliance report script.
- **Practitioner insights expanded to four new sources** (`guide/ecosystem/practitioner-insights.md`): added Devoxx (Java/JVM/architecture conference talks), Dev With AI Meetup (French AI-native development meetup), ByteByteGo (system design), and Stanford Online (academic ML/LLM coursework) alongside the existing IFTTD podcast corpus. Insight count grew from 22 to 65, with four new per-corpus source tables. Attributed field reports were also folded directly into `guide/security/security-hardening.md`, `guide/security/sandbox-native.md`, `guide/security/sandbox-isolation.md`, `guide/roles/agent-evaluation.md`, `guide/core/context-engineering.md`, `guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`, `guide/ops/observability.md`, `guide/workflows/agent-teams.md`, `guide/roles/adoption-approaches.md`, `guide/roles/ai-roles.md`, and `guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`. Notable additions: a formal Boolean-circuit bound on chain-of-thought reasoning (Denny Zhou, Stanford CS25 V5, 2025), a nine-speaker independent convergence on a 70% context-degradation threshold (Dev With AI Meetup), and a documented REX on unsupervised 24/7 agent delegation reducing team velocity. Also folded in field reports from The Product Crew (French product-management podcast) into `guide/roles/adoption-approaches.md` and `guide/roles/ai-roles.md`, treated as single-instance 2026 accounts rather than established data. Corrected a stale insight count (previously reported as 22 in `machine-readable/reference.yaml` and `guide/README.md` even before this expansion; the actual pre-expansion count was 35). Full attribution in `guide/core/credits.md`.
- **AI unit economics guide** (`guide/ops/ai-unit-economics.md`, new file): original synthesis addressing an unmodeled gap surfaced across all eight source corpora analyzed for the practitioner-insights expansion above (none of them model the real cost of agentic AI at scale). Covers per-task cost decomposition (input/output/cache/tool-call/sub-agent tokens), the four cost levers with practitioner sourcing where available (complexity-based routing, sub-agent context isolation, exit criteria and max-iterations, cache reuse), the break-even point of an autonomous agent, and team budget governance (cross-linked to `guide/ops/api-gateway.md` for implementation). Explicitly flagged in its introduction as original analysis, not a practitioner-sourced compilation.

### Changed

- **data-privacy.md** (`guide/security/data-privacy.md`): reframed around CLI-specific risks for practitioners. Removed policy-paraphrase sections (retention tiers, Constitutional AI, IP considerations). Enriched the `/bug` command section with live verification commands and clarification that session context is included without scrubbing. Added a 7-point Quick Audit Checklist with runnable shell commands (training opt-out, bug command, env file blocking, native messaging host, MCP inventory, telemetry vars, env secret exposure). Section numbering updated throughout.

### Added

- **llms.txt / llms-full.txt / machine-readable/llms.txt stats sync** (3 files): updated Last Updated to June 21 2026, Lines of Documentation from 26,058 to 26,494 (reflects current ultimate-guide.md line count), Production Templates from 314 to 262 (authoritative count from check-landing-sync.sh method), and inline body references in llms-full.txt (FAQ answer, repo structure, What Is section).

- **Team knowledge infrastructure guide** (`guide/ecosystem/team-knowledge-base.md`, new file): answers the question "where do we put the company knowledge base so both Claude Code and Cowork can use it?" Covers the 3-tier framework (static Markdown vault for direct file reads, MCP connectors for live systems like Jira/Confluence/Notion/GitBook, RAG at scale for large corpora), the ~100-1000 doc threshold for switching from direct reads to retrieval, Onyx (self-hosted, ex-Danswer), LlamaCloud and Ragie as managed RAG via MCP, the plugin pattern for distributing team workflows, and the Cowork-specific governance caveat (audit log and DLP gaps as of mid-2026). Includes setup code snippets, comparison tables, and a decision table for what to build first. Cross-linked from ultimate-guide.md Cowork section and guide/README.md Ecosystem table. Machine-readable index updated: 18 new entries in reference.yaml, shared_knowledge block in cowork-reference.yaml, llms.txt/machine-readable/llms.txt updated.

- **Practitioner insights from IFTTD podcast** (`guide/ecosystem/practitioner-insights.md`): new file consolidating paraphrased field insights from 11 IFTTD episodes (290-361), organized into 5 themes: context engineering, agentic patterns and orchestration, LLM evaluation, agent security, and DevX and adoption. 22 attributed insights from practitioners including Guillaume Laforge (Google Cloud), Zineb Bendhiba (Red Hat), Frédéric Barthelet (Theodo), Samy Lastmann (Arago), Jocelyn N'takpe (ManoMano), and others. All French content reformulated in English with attribution format: name, role, company, episode number, ifttd.io URL. No direct quotes.

- **Semantic chunking and synthetic question generation** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`, new subsection "Query-Side Indexing"): practical explanation of semantic chunking (boundary detection over fixed-token splitting) and synthetic question generation at index time (doc2query: Nogueira and Lin, 2019; HyDE: Gao et al., 2022). Retrieval improvement framed as Laforge's practitioner order-of-magnitude estimate, not a constant. Attributed to Guillaume Laforge (IFTTD ep 361).

- **Large context window anti-pattern note** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md`): practitioner paragraph after the Liu et al. "Lost in the Middle" citation clarifying that filling a 1M-token window is an anti-pattern, not a capability demonstration. Attributed to Guillaume Laforge (IFTTD ep 361). Also updated the Liu et al. citation to full form: "Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts", TACL 2024, arXiv:2307.03172.

- **Evaluating probabilistic systems** (`guide/roles/agent-evaluation.md`, new major section): six subsections covering scored-dataset evaluation (not red/green unit tests), statistical CI/CD with bash example (replay 10-100x, measure success rate as percentage), async LLM-as-judge pattern, hallucination as a calibrated trade-off, OpenTelemetry and Langfuse observability with trace structure example, and workflow vs pure agent evaluation implications. Sources: Louis Pinsard (ep 338), Frédéric Barthelet (ep 329), Samy Lastmann (ep 311).

- **Agent security field incidents** (`guide/security/sandbox-native.md`, new subsection "Why Sandboxing Matters: Field Incidents"): two documented production incidents: guardrail evasion where an agent emptied a file when the delete operation was blocked (Zineb Bendhiba, ep 326), and data loss incidents including home directory wipes and database deletions across multiple agent products (Guillaume Lours, ep 360).

- **Command allowlist principle** (`guide/security/security-hardening.md`): practical paragraph at the start of the MCP vetting workflow section recommending specific allowlist patterns (allow git add and git commit, require explicit approval before git push, hard resets, force-deletes, or database mutations). Illustrated with a real incident involving Firefox bookmark loss (Jocelyn N'takpe, ep 346).

- **MCP usage principles** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`, new subsection after the Quality Score block): three field-derived principles: keep tool count small to reduce hallucination probability, design tools as complete user intents not atomic endpoints, and the LLM is stateless with respect to MCP routing. Sources: Zineb Bendhiba (ep 326) and Frédéric Barthelet (ep 329).

- **Practitioner testimonials** (`guide/workflows/agent-teams.md`): four new entries in the testimonials section: Samy Lastmann on micro-agents over mega-prompts (ep 311), Guillaume Laforge on harness engineering as the emerging term for multi-agent orchestration (ep 361), Quentin Adam on Claude orchestrating Gemini for large-context rewrites (ep 341), and Jocelyn N'takpe on ManoMano's production MCP stack at scale (ep 346).

- **Adoption field notes** (`guide/roles/adoption-approaches.md`): three paragraphs after the empirical data table covering ManoMano's documentation-as-onboarding approach (N'takpe ep 346), the Mundler et al. typed-language safety net study (ETH Zurich and UC Berkeley, PLDI 2025, arXiv:2504.09246, correctly cited as "94% of compilation errors are type errors" not "94% of agent errors avoidable"), and practitioner notes on alternating AI and manual coding to preserve deep system understanding (Deleuze ep 349) and capping AI-assisted development cycles per day against cognitive load (Lepine ep 351).

- **IFTTD attribution** (`guide/core/credits.md`): full attribution entry for the IFTTD podcast (Bruno Soulez, ifttd.io, 360+ episodes), listing all 9 guide sections that draw on IFTTD material with episode numbers and speaker names.

- **Third-party tool: CodeBurn** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): new dedicated section under Token & Cost Tracking. CodeBurn (8,100+ stars, MIT, Node.js 22.13+) reads Claude Code JSONL session logs and classifies every turn into 13 categories (Coding, Debugging, Exploration, Conversation, etc.) via deterministic local pattern matching, no LLM calls. Key differentiator from ccusage: CodeBurn explains WHERE tokens went and correlates sessions with git commits via `codeburn yield`; ccusage tracks how much was spent. Notable commands: `optimize` (retry loops, redundant re-reads), `compare` (model breakdown), `yield` (sessions vs. shipped commits), `menubar` (macOS SwiftBar widget), MCP server (v0.9.12+). Covers verified usage patterns, cost estimate caveats (LiteLLM pricing, not Anthropic billing API), and when to use alongside ccusage.

- **Context engineering tool: Token Savior** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`): new section after tilth. Token Savior (Mibayy/token-savior, ~1,000 stars, Python 3.11+, MIT) is a three-in-one MCP server covering structural code navigation by symbol (replaces full-file reads), Bash output compaction (34 compactors for git/pytest/jest/kubectl, opt-in via `TS_BASH_COMPACT=1`), and persistent cross-session memory via SQLite FTS5. Covers 6 tool profiles (full/core/nav/lean/ultra/tiny), 15+ navigation tools, tsbench results (Claude Opus 4.7, 96 tasks, -77% active tokens, synthetic 2,000-line codebase), install via pip/uvx, comparison with tilth (tilth: faster, independently benchmarked, 14 languages; Token Savior: adds Bash compaction + cross-session memory).

- **Zero-install context reduction note** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`): brief entry for claude-token-efficient (drona23, 5,700+ stars) at the end of section 3. Frames it honestly as a single CLAUDE.md file that adjusts model output style, not a compressor. Notes the uncited 63% claim and the tool's ceiling (output tokens only, cannot compress shell output or file reads).

### Updated

- **Headroom section rewrite** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`): corrected wrong URL (`headroom.ai` was an unrelated domain; correct source is `github.com/chopratejas/headroom` with docs at `headroom-docs.vercel.app`). Updated star count to 43,000 (June 2026). Added full deployment mode list (Python lib, TypeScript/npm, HTTP proxy, MCP server, agent wrap). Explained CCR (Compress-Cache-Retrieve) architecture: `{{HEADROOM_TAG_N}}` placeholders + SQLite/HNSW/FTS5 store + cross-agent shared memory. Added output shaper mechanism (cache-prefix-safe brevity instruction + 10% holdout control group). Corrected benchmark scope: published 92% figures are for specific content types under optimal conditions; independent full-session measurement found approximately 47% reduction. Added five known bugs: Issue #714 (5-minute CCR TTL, retrieval failures on long jobs), Issue #1158 (200K context cap for Claude Max users with `headroom wrap`, use MCP instead), Issue #1227 (CORS security, unresolved), Issue #1209 (placeholder stored as original in CCR), Issue #1233 (28% Python syntax failure in CodeAwareCompressor).

- **Table of Contents and tool selection table** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`): ToC section 3 updated to list Token Savior. Section 10 "file reads" row updated to include Token Savior alongside tilth and lean-ctx. Confidence header date updated from March 2026 to June 2026.

### Fixed

- **Dead relative links across the `git-worktree` skill suite** (`examples/skills/git-worktree*/SKILL.md`): fixed 13 broken relative links that 404'd on GitHub. In `git-worktree/SKILL.md`, the three "Companion commands" links pointed at `./git-worktree-{status,remove,clean}.md` (same directory) instead of the command files at `../../commands/`, and the "Database Branch Setup Guide" link used `../workflows/` instead of `../../workflows/`. The `git-worktree-status`, `git-worktree-remove`, and `git-worktree-clean` skills each had a "Part of:" line whose three cross-references used `./*.md` (same directory) instead of `../../commands/`. All links now resolve to existing files.

- **Dead relative links in `review-pr`, `sandbox-status`, `scaffold`, `session-save` skills**: fixed 10 more broken relative links found via a full scan of `examples/skills/`. These used the wrong `../` depth — `../../guide/...` (resolving to the non-existent `examples/guide/`) instead of `../../../guide/...`, and `../hooks/`, `../config/`, `../agents/`, `../skills/` (resolving inside `examples/skills/`) instead of `../../`. All now resolve to the repo-root `guide/` and the `examples/{hooks,config,agents,skills}/` directories. Verified the full `examples/skills/` tree (117 files, 57 relative links) is now 0 dead links.

- **Dead relative links in `docs/resource-evaluations/`**: fixed 10 broken navigation links found via a full link scan (1002 relative links across 259 files in `guide/` + `docs/`). Wrong `../` depth or stale filenames in `mikul-gohil-hooks-evaluation.md`, `nick-jensen-plugins.md`, `beyond-vibe-coding.md`, `siddhant-khare-ai-fatigue.md`, `system-prompts-official-vs-community.md`, and `2026-02-07-paul-rayner-agent-teams-linkedin.md` — they pointed into non-existent `docs/guide/` or `examples/guide/` paths instead of the repo-root `guide/` subdirectories. Illustrative paths inside code blocks, the generated `ultimate-guide.fr.md`, and 3 intentional/forward-reference links were left untouched. (The matching `guide/` link fixes were already merged upstream.)

- **Security: shell injection in `claude-issue-triage.yml`** (`examples/github-actions/claude-issue-triage.yml`): `github.event.issue.title` and `github.event.issue.body` were interpolated directly into shell via `${{ }}`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands by crafting a malicious issue title. Fixed by moving both values to step-level `env:` (`ISSUE_TITLE`, `ISSUE_BODY`) and referencing them as plain shell variables, so GitHub Actions never interpolates user content into the script text. Reported in issue #50.

### Added

- **Section 9.18.5 Open Knowledge Format (OKF)** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): new section covering Google Cloud's OKF v0.1, published June 12, 2026. Explains the Karpathy LLM Wiki origin pattern (April 2026 gist, 16M+ views on X), how an OKF bundle works (directory of markdown files with YAML frontmatter, `type` field as the only required key), how OKF compares to existing patterns (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, llms.txt sit at different layers), adoption status (v0.1 invitation not yet a standard, Google Cloud Knowledge Catalog already ingests it), decision guidance on when OKF fits vs llms.txt vs CLAUDE.md, and a minimal quick-start example. Existing 9.18.5–9.18.11 renumbered to 9.18.6–9.18.12.

- **Smart-suggest BM25 routing** (`guide/workflows/smart-suggest-routing.md` + `examples/hooks/bm25-routing/`): self-calibrating BM25 lexical scoring layer for `UserPromptSubmit` hooks; complements the existing regex smart-suggest with intent-based skill routing; includes runnable Node.js example with auto-calibration, detached index rebuild, and sample skill corpora

- **Context engineering tools: tilth and maki** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`, `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): added documentation for two new token-efficiency tools discovered via HN community analysis. tilth (MCP server, `cargo install tilth`) uses tree-sitter for structural code navigation with benchmarked results of -40% cost and +10pp accuracy across Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6, and Haiku 4.5 (160 runs, 4 repos). maki (standalone Rust TUI agent, replaces Claude Code rather than augmenting it) with embedded Python code execution and dynamic model selection for subtasks. Also added a real-world cost calibration note to the RTK section: bash output is ~12% of total session token usage (not the dominant source), file reads are ~65%, so RTK's actual API bill impact is 6-10% despite its per-command compression ratios of 60-90%. Section 10 tool selection table updated with tilth for the "file reads consuming most of context budget" use case.

- **Third-party tool: SkillSpector** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): added NVIDIA's skill security scanner to the Security Scanning section. SkillSpector scans skills before installation using 64 patterns across 16 categories (prompt injection, data exfiltration, MCP tool poisoning, trigger abuse, supply chain, rogue agent, taint tracking, YARA signatures). Two-stage pipeline: fast static analysis then optional LLM revalidation (~87% precision). SC4 pattern queries OSV.dev live for CVE data. Apache 2.0. Fills the gap between AgentShield (config audit) and DeepSec (app code audit): neither previously covered pre-install skill vetting.

- **Security check skill: deep skill content analysis** (`.claude/commands/security-check.md`, `examples/skills/security-check/SKILL.md`): Phase 3 now includes a "Deep skill content analysis" block inspired by SkillSpector patterns. Adds detection for hidden HTML comments and zero-width characters in skill files (TP1), base64 blobs over 40 chars (TP1/SC3), RTL unicode override characters (TP2), trigger keywords shadowing built-in commands (TR2), `curl | bash` patterns in skill scripts (SC2), cron/launchctl persistence writes (RA2), and env-harvesting-plus-network-call combinations (E2+E1). Applied to both the command version and the skill template.

- **Third-party tool: Ponytail** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): added to Plugin Ecosystem / Notable skill packs and Recommendations by Persona. Ponytail is a cross-agent skill that enforces a "lazy senior dev" decision ladder before writing code (YAGNI → stdlib → native platform feature → installed dependency → one line → minimum that works). Benchmarked at 80-94% less code, 47-77% lower cost, and 3-6x faster than unconstrained agents across Haiku/Sonnet/Opus. Ships with 4 commands (`/ponytail`, `/ponytail-review`, `/ponytail-audit`, `/ponytail-debt`) and supports 13 agents. MIT, by DietrichGebert.

- **Search index: GDPR/Privacy and Governance sections** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`): added 16 `data_privacy_*` entries covering data flow, retention tiers (5y/30d/ZDR), known risks (`/bug` command, `.env` exposure, MCP DB), protective measures, and GDPR/HIPAA/PCI compliance. Governance and privacy sections are now searchable via cmd+k on the landing site and link to the local guide reader at `cc.bruniaux.com/guide/`.

- **Section 9.26 Review-Driven Context Optimization** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): new advanced pattern covering how to convert structured inline review feedback (via tools like [crit](https://github.com/tomasz-tomczyk/crit)) into CLAUDE.md rules. Covers the round-to-round diff as a verification mechanism, pattern extraction from review comment threads, promotion criteria, and the compounding effect over multiple sessions. Cross-referenced with §9.24 (Instinct-Based Learning) and §9.23 (Update Loop). Added to chapter 9 quick jump and ToC.
- **Resource evaluation: crit** (`docs/resource-evaluations/crit-human-in-loop-review.md`): score 4/5, decision: integrate. Tool by tomasz-tomczyk for human-in-the-loop review with round-to-round diffing, inline plan review before execution, DOM-anchored web app comments, and native Claude Code integration.

- **Hermes Agent section** (`guide/ecosystem/agentic-tools.md`): updated to v0.15.1 (from v0.14.0). Added concrete GEPA benchmark (40% faster task completion after 20+ auto-generated skills). Expanded Quick Start with `hermes chat` entry point and WSL2/no-WebUI note. Added "Known Operational Issues (v0.15.x)" subsection covering 7 production pitfalls with YAML/bash fixes: analysis-before-action via SOUL.md, SOUL.md vs AGENTS.md separation, kanban parallelism flood (`max_in_progress_per_profile: null` default), subprocess PATH inheritance (`env_passthrough`), worker protocol violations (missing `kanban_complete`), SQLite corruption with backup strategy, `HERMES_HOME` not propagated to subprocesses, and token overhead (~13,900 fixed tokens per call, gateway multiplier). Issues traced to community reports #28712, #18594, #4379, #23717.

### Updated

- Promoted Opus 4.8 (`claude-opus-4-8`) to current/recommended/default Opus across guide, whitepapers, recap cards, machine-readable files, and landing data; demoted Opus 4.6 and 4.7 to previous generation.
- Added Fable 5 (`claude-fable-5`, Mythos-class) to model-lineup and selection tables throughout the guide and whitepapers.
- Updated fast-mode references from "6x price" to "2x price" (verified for Opus 4.8) and corrected the `/fast` cheatsheet entry.
- Marked Opus 4.8 standard pricing as "see official docs" (no published rate); kept 4.6/4.7 rows as previous-generation reference.
- Updated effort API code example (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §11.1) from `claude-opus-4-7` to `claude-opus-4-8`.
- Added "Escalating to Fable 5" mini-section at §2.5 (model selection guide): decision trigger, practical scenarios, access command, and pricing note.

### Security

- **Threat database v2.21.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`): monthly update for June 2026.
  - New campaign: **Miasma Worm** (TeamPCP, June 1-5, 2026): first self-propagating supply chain worm targeting AI coding agent config files. Compromised 32 npm packages under `@redhat-cloud-services` then propagated to 73 Microsoft Azure GitHub repositories. Attack vector: zero-width Unicode injection into `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursorrules`, invisible to human reviewers. Exfiltrates SSH keys, AWS credentials, GitHub tokens, cryptocurrency keystores to TeamPCP C2 infrastructure.
  - New attack technique **T032** (Zero-Width Unicode Injection into AI Agent Config Files): hidden instructions using U+200B/200C/200D/FEFF characters in `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`. Includes detection commands and mitigation guidance.
  - New IOCs: 4 TeamPCP/Miasma C2 IPs (`83.142.209.194`, `.11`, `.203`, `216.126.225.129:8443`) and domain `git-service.com` (registered 2026-05-16).
  - New scanning tools: **NVIDIA SkillSpector** (open-source, 64 patterns across 16 categories, part of Verified Agent Skills framework, May 22, 2026) and **VIPER-MCP** (arXiv 2605.21392, academic framework, scanned 39,884 repos, found 106 zero-days, 67 CVEs assigned, May 30, 2026).
  - New defensive resource: **vulnerablemcp.info** (community MCP vulnerability database, seeded from VIPER-MCP scan, June 2026).
  - 6 new sources added (157 total). Total: 157 sources, 15 campaigns, 32 attack techniques, 37 scanning tools, 26 defensive resources, 10 C2 IPs, 4 malicious domains.

### Documentation

- **Resource evaluations**: evaluated liza-mas token-saving CLI tools and Semble semantic search
  - `liza-mas` roster (scip-search, mdtoc, functional-clusters, stacklit-cli): all score 1-2/5. scip-search (0 stars, day-one release), mdtoc (1 star, generic utility), and functional-clusters (0 stars, framework-internal) rejected. stacklit-cli (2 stars, Go variant of documented stacklit concept) added to watch-list with trigger condition 50+ stars.
  - Semble (MinishLab/semble, ~5k stars, MIT): score 3/5. Integrated as Ollama-free alternative to grepai in `guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md` Code Search section. Corrects community claim of "index-free" (Semble builds and caches an index; the differentiator is no Ollama dependency, broader search scope code+docs+config).
  - Eval files: `docs/resource-evaluations/liza-mas-token-saving-cli-tools.md`, `docs/resource-evaluations/semble-code-search.md`
- **Cost Optimization Levers table** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §9.13): added a structured overview of the 6 cost levers (monitoring, output compression, model routing, prompt caching, batch processing, semantic pre-indexing) with Native vs. API/SDK columns and cross-links to existing documented sections. Includes RouteLLM citation (lm-sys, ICLR 2025, arXiv 2406.18665: 85% cost reduction on MT-Bench vs always-strong routing).
- **Batch API discoverability** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §9.13): added cross-link to Message Batches API section in `core/architecture.md` (50% cheaper async processing), previously only reachable from an architecture deep-dive.
- **machine-readable/reference.yaml**: added `semble_*` entries (upstream, guide, evaluation, purpose, vs_grepai note), `cost_levers_table` pointer (§9.13 new subsection), `batch_api_cost_lever`, `routellm_citation` (arXiv:2406.18665). Updated `updated` date to 2026-06-10, `resource_evaluations_count` to 86.

- **Claude Code releases tracking**: updated from v2.1.168 to v2.1.170
  - v2.1.169 (2026-06-09): `--safe-mode` flag + `CLAUDE_CODE_SAFE_MODE`, `/cd` command, `disableBundledSkills` setting, enterprise MCP policy fix, macOS startup stall fix, 15+ bug fixes
  - v2.1.170 (2026-06-09): ⭐ Claude Fable 5 (Mythos-class model) access, VS Code terminal transcript fix

## [3.41.2] - 2026-06-04

### Security

- **Threat database v2.20.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`): monthly update. New CVE: CVE-2026-32211 (Azure DevOps MCP `@azure-devops/mcp`, CVSS 9.1, missing authentication, no patch yet). New attack technique T031 Shadow Escape (Operant AI, May 2026): zero-click data exfiltration via poisoned documents in MCP-connected AI assistants, no user interaction beyond document upload, exfil blends into normal agent traffic. New scanning tools: Golf Scanner (open-source Go CLI, discovers MCP configs across 7 IDEs, 20 security checks, 0-100 risk score) and Microsoft MDASH (multi-model agentic vuln discovery, 100+ AI agents, Defender integration). New defensive resources: NSA AISC MCP Security Design Considerations advisory (May 20, 2026), Five Eyes "Careful Adoption of Agentic AI Services" joint guidance (May 4, 2026), Microsoft Build 2026 MXC SDK + Agent 365 policy controls. Updated: hightower6eu malicious skill count 354 to 677; CVE-2026-39861 description clarified as symlink sandbox escape, fixed_in corrected to 2.1.64. 7 new sources added (151 total).

## [3.41.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Landing catalog sync** (`examples-data.ts`, `scripts/check-landing-sync.sh`): added 50 missing SKILL.md entries to the landing examples catalog. All standalone skills added since the last manual sync (2026-05-03) are now discoverable on cc.bruniaux.com/examples/. Skills added: ci-all, ci-pipeline, ci-status, ci-tests, commit, ship, pr, review-pr, review-plan, release-notes, land-and-deploy, canary, sandbox-status, git-worktree, git-worktree-clean, git-worktree-remove, git-worktree-status, handoff-create, handoff-resume, handoff-update, session-save, catchup, investigate, diagnose, explain, learn-alternatives, learn-quiz, learn-teach, qa, refactor, optimize, generate-tests, validate-changes, audit-codebase, sonarqube, check-cache-bugs, security, security-audit, security-check, update-threat-db, scaffold, recipe-template, methodology-advisor, autoresearch, routines-discover, plan-pipeline, eval-agents, eval-hooks, plus templates/feature-list.json and workflows/feature-list.json. Catalog grows from 220 to 270 indexed entries. Fixed sync check script pointing at dead pre-Astro HTML files; now reads from examples-data.ts and index.astro directly. Reconciled count: all landing pages now display 270 (was 255/219 inconsistency). Plugin callout corrected from "All 255 templates as plugins" to "180+ core templates as 8 plugins" (accurate).

- **CLI reference full sync** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §10.3 CLI Flags Reference + Subcommands): synced against the official `code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference` page. Added 14 missing flags: `--bare`, `--bg`, `--exec`, `--effort`, `--name/-n`, `--tmux`, `--debug-file`, `--dangerously-load-development-channels`, `--exclude-dynamic-system-prompt-sections`, `--include-hook-events`, `--prompt-suggestions`, `--replay-user-messages`, `--remote-control/--rc`, `--remote-control-session-name-prefix`. Added 8 missing subcommands: `claude attach`, `claude auto-mode defaults`, `claude daemon status/stop`, `claude logs`, `claude respawn`, `claude rm`, `claude stop`. Fixed 2 pre-existing em dashes in the section.

- **Environment variables full sync** (`guide/core/settings-reference.md` § Environment Variables): synced the env var catalog from v2.1.81 to v2.1.162 against the official `code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars` page. Added ~90 missing variables across existing categories and three new subsections: OpenTelemetry (15 vars: `OTEL_LOG_*`, `OTEL_METRICS_*`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OTEL_*`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PROPAGATE_TRACEPARENT`), Plugins (`CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_*`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SYNC_PLUGIN_*`), and SDK and Headless (`CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_*`, `CCR_FORCE_BUNDLE`, `CLAUDE_REMOTE_CONTROL_SESSION_NAME_PREFIX`, etc.). Cloud Providers split into four sub-tables: Bedrock, Bedrock Mantle, Vertex AI (with 12 region overrides), Foundry, Claude Platform on AWS. Promoted `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_TURNS` from Unverified to official Timeouts category. Fixed `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB` description. Added cross-links from `ultimate-guide.md` §10.3 and Appendix A to the full catalog. Updated `machine-readable/reference.yaml` description to reflect 190+ vars across 17 categories.

- **DeepSec** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md` § Security Scanning): documented Vercel Labs' agent-powered application vulnerability scanner. Covers the 5-step pipeline (scan → process → triage → revalidate → export), CLI commands, `--diff` mode for PR gating, distributed execution via Vercel Sandboxes, cost model (Claude Opus 4 with extended thinking, $10–50+ per full scan), false positive rate (~10–20%), plugin system, and security posture recommendations. Updated section intro to cover both config-level and application-level scanning.

- **Built-in Tools Reference** (`guide/core/tools-reference.md`): new page covering all 40 built-in tools. Full tool table by category (file ops, execution, web, agents, tasks, scheduling, MCP, worktrees, control flow) with permission-required column and version notes. Complete `ToolName(specifier)` permission rule format table including the previously missing `Skill(deploy *)` row and corrected `Agent(Explore)` name. Per-tool behavior sections for Bash (working-dir carry-over, env var persistence, 2-min default/10-min max timeout, 30k char output cap), Edit (read-before-edit, exact-match, uniqueness), Glob (100-file cap, no `.gitignore` by default), Grep (ripgrep syntax, `.gitignore`-aware, 3 output modes), Read (images, PDFs with page ranges, Jupyter notebooks), WebFetch (lossy Markdown conversion, 15-min cache, redirect behavior), WebSearch, Write. Mini how-to sections for Monitor (v2.1.98+), Workflow/ultracode (v2.1.154+), `/loop`+ScheduleWakeup, agent teams (TeamCreate/TeamDelete/SendMessage behind `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`), and Tasks API including `TaskStop` and the v2.1.142 TodoWrite disable-by-default change. Linked from `guide/README.md`, root `README.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, and `guide/cheatsheet.md`.

- **architecture.md fix** (`guide/core/architecture.md`): removed the outdated claim "Claude Code has exactly 8 core tools"; replaced with framing that names 8 daily-use tools and points to the new complete reference. Updated `Task` to `Agent` (current tool name) and added a note that `TodoWrite` is superseded by the Tasks API since v2.1.16, disabled by default since v2.1.142.

### Documentation

- **Glossary split** (`guide/core/`): separated the previous monolithic glossary file into two focused files. `glossary.md` now covers the 31 official Claude Code terms (Agent teams, Agentic loop, Auto memory, Bare mode, Channel, Compaction, Dispatch, Effort level, Hook, MCP, Non-interactive mode, Permission mode, Project trust, Settings layers, Skill, Subagent, Surface, Teleport, Verification loop, Worktree isolation, and more) in paragraph format with links to guide sections. `community-patterns.md` preserves the previous ~130-term table covering community-coined patterns (Boris Cherny pattern, ACE pipeline, BMAD, gstack, context engineering, vibe coding) alongside AI engineering vocabulary and Claude Code config quick-reference. `guide/README.md` updated with entries for both files.

- **Hooks documentation pass 3**: verified lifecycle diagram exit code is Exit 2 (blocks) in both mermaid and ASCII fallback; confirmed PermissionRequest and SubagentStop nodes present in diagram with correct styles and click links; verified `examples/hooks/README.md` event table covers all 30 events grouped by 8 categories; confirmed quiz question 07-002 states 30 events in 8 groups with correct group enumeration; confirmed `guide/core/settings-reference.md` references the full hook event set via section link rather than a hardcoded count. All items were already correct following passes 1 and 2; this pass documents the final verification.

- **Hooks and skills documentation pass 2** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): corrected `Setup` event description (was "environment setup phase at session start", fires only with `--init-only`/`--init`/`--maintenance` in `-p` mode); corrected async hooks limitation (guide incorrectly stated they cannot return `additionalContext`, they can); added `agent_id`/`agent_type` to common input fields table; added `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` section for SessionStart/Setup/CwdChanged/FileChanged; added Per-Event Reference table covering all 30 events with specific input/output fields; added `model` and `hooks:` to skills frontmatter table; added deprecation notice for `.claude/commands/` (merged into `.claude/skills/` since v2.1.3); updated Common Patterns table to say "Skill (user-invocable)" instead of "Command"; fixed em dash in HumanLayer source link; corrected `MessageDisplay` description and `hooks_async_limitations` in reference.yaml; added `skill_frontmatter_fields` block to reference.yaml. Second pass corrected two factually wrong "When it fires" descriptions in the 30-event table: `PermissionDenied` (now correctly states it only fires when the **auto mode classifier** denies, not on manual user denials, and documents the `retry: true` output); `Elicitation` (was "Claude requests information from user (headless)", now correctly "An MCP server requests user input during a tool call"). Also improved `InstructionsLoaded` (added `.claude/rules/*.md` and lazy-load detail), `CwdChanged`/`FileChanged`/`WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove` (aligned wording with official spec), and removed an em dash from the Stop/SubagentStop callout.

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.162 (2026-06-04)
  - v2.1.162: Quieter startup, `claude agents --json` waitingFor, slash-command fill-in, Windsurf renamed Devin Desktop, 25+ bug fixes
  - v2.1.161: OTEL custom dimensions, agents done/total, /mcp unused connectors collapsed, parallel tool-call isolation, 20+ bug fixes
  - v2.1.160: `ultracode` replaces `workflow` keyword (breaking), security prompts for startup files and build-tool configs, Edit after grep, 20+ bug fixes
  - v2.1.159: Internal infrastructure improvements (no user-facing changes)

### Added

- **`hooks-events-reference.md`** (`guide/core/hooks-events-reference.md`): new comprehensive reference for all 30 Claude Code hook events. Covers matcher field per event type (different events match on different fields), exit code 2 behavior for all 30 events, decision control format per event (top-level `decision` vs `hookSpecificOutput` vs path return), key input fields per event, handler configuration fields for all 5 types (command, http, mcp_tool, prompt, agent), `asyncRewake` field, `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` availability, `terminalSequence`, path placeholders, and common gotchas (Stop hook 8-block cap, `UserPromptSubmit` 30s default, `WorktreeCreate` replaces git entirely, and more).
- **`eval-agents` skill** (`examples/skills/eval-agents/SKILL.md`): new audit skill for Claude Code agent fleets. Scores agents on 5 criteria (name, description specificity, model tier, tools scoping, system prompt quality) out of 15 pts with a +1 hardening bonus. Detects description overlap between agents that causes non-deterministic orchestrator dispatch, flags missing `tools:` fields (unconstrained session tool inheritance), identifies human-in-the-loop anti-patterns that break headless pipelines, and checks model-task alignment using the haiku/sonnet/opus matrix. Follows the same interactive review pattern as `eval-hooks` and `eval-rules`.

### Changed

- **`eval-hooks` skill updated** (`examples/skills/eval-hooks/SKILL.md`, `~/.claude/skills/eval-hooks/SKILL.md`): fixed event count from 26 to 30 in the scoring criterion; added reference to `hooks-events-reference.md` in the matcher section; added `asyncRewake` edge case.
- **`eval-rules` skill updated** (`examples/skills/eval-rules/SKILL.md`): added user-level rules (`~/.claude/rules/`) to Key Concepts and Step 1 discovery, documented brace expansion support in `paths:` globs, noted symlink support as a named edge case, added `InstructionsLoaded` hook tip for debugging load issues, removed all em dashes from template output examples.
- **`eval-skills` skill updated** (`examples/skills/eval-skills/SKILL.md`): full valid frontmatter table (agentskills.io spec + Claude Code extensions), string substitution placeholder reference, `xhigh`/`max` effort level added to inference engine, scoring raised to 16 pts, removed stale `skills-ref` CLI pre-check section.
- **73 example skills audited and corrected** (`examples/skills/`): removed U+2014 em dashes from ~30 files (hook-enforced ban); removed unsupported `tags:` field from all 7 talk-pipeline sub-skills; fixed `allowed-tools` comma-without-brackets format in 10 files (design-patterns, eval-rules, eval-hooks, plan-pipeline, all 7 talk-pipeline stages); corrected 4 effort mismatches (review-pr and talk-pipeline/orchestrator bumped to `high`, security-check and validate-changes bumped to `medium`); added `when_to_use:` trigger phrasing to 18 skills; added `allowed-tools: Read Grep Glob` to methodology-advisor; scoped `Bash(ccboard*)` on ccboard.

### Fixed

- **Broken URLs corrected across 11 files**: `florian.bruniaux.com/guides` replaced with `cc.bruniaux.com/whitepapers/` in `docs/for-cto.md`, `llms.txt`, `machine-readable/llms.txt`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `mcp-server/content/llms.txt`, `mcp-server/content/reference.yaml`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`. Also fixed `quiz.html` → `/quiz/` and `cheatsheet.html` → `/cheatsheet/` in all three `llms.txt` files (no Vercel redirect existed for those `.html` paths).

### Documentation

- **Hooks documentation completed and corrected across 6 files**: fixed a factual bug in the lifecycle diagram (`PreToolUse` was labeled `Exit 1: block`, the correct blocking exit code is 2); aligned the hook-event count from 27/19 to 30 across `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §7, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `quiz/questions/07-hooks.yaml`, `guide/core/settings-reference.md`, and `examples/hooks/README.md`; added the 3 previously missing events (`PostToolBatch`, `UserPromptExpansion`, `MessageDisplay`) to all event tables; corrected `PreCompact` and `TaskCreated` Can-Block fields (both were marked No, both are Yes); added the `mcp_tool` hook type and the `asyncRewake` field to the §7 type list and the configuration table; added `terminalSequence` to the universal JSON output fields; added a `/hooks` menu description in §7.2; enriched the lifecycle diagram with `PermissionRequest` and `SubagentStop` nodes; updated stale line-number anchors in `reference.yaml`; and extended the `examples/hooks/README.md` events table from 17 to 30 events grouped by category.

- **Ruflo entry refreshed** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): npm name corrected to `ruflo` (was `claude-flow`), agent counts updated to 98 agents and 30 skills, dual install paths documented (plugin-lite vs full CLI), agent federation section added (zero-trust cross-machine collaboration, absent from the entire guide before this update), plugin marketplace (33 plugins) and web surfaces (flo.ruv.io, goal.ruv.io) noted.

### Added

- **Real-world token benchmarks in context-engineering.md** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md`, 2026-05-27): New "Real-World Session Benchmarks" subsection in Section 15 with practitioner-sourced data. Per-turn ranges by task type (10-30K simple question, 100-300K feature, 300K-1M+ heavy investigation) and per-session ranges (100-300K quick fix, 500K-2M complete PR, 5M-20M+ long session with compaction). Sourced from community discussion (May 2026, Max 200 / Opus 4.7 at high effort).
- **`claude-crusts` added to observability.md** (`guide/ops/observability.md`, 2026-05-27): Added to external monitoring tools table and decision guide. One-command context pollution scanner by Abinesh-L.
- **`tokens/feature` KPI added to team-metrics.md** (`guide/ops/team-metrics.md`, 2026-05-27): New metric row in AI-specific metrics table. Average tokens consumed per merged feature, crossed with ticket boundaries. Complements tokens/request for team-level reporting.

- **Whitepapers WP12 expanded** (`whitepapers/fr/12-agent-engineering.qmd` and `whitepapers/en/12-agent-engineering.qmd`, 2026-05-27): New section "L'Écosystème des Agents en 2026" / "The Agent Ecosystem in 2026" added to both FR and EN versions. Covers terminal coding agents (Codex CLI, Hermes Agent, Aider), autonomous agents (Devin, SWE-agent, claude -p), multi-agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen/MAF), and a decision matrix with situation-to-tool mapping. Fiche récap updated with a sixth bullet. Cross-ref to guide/ecosystem/agentic-tools.md.

- **New page: Agent Tools Beyond Claude Code** (`guide/ecosystem/agentic-tools.md`, 2026-05-27): Comprehensive coverage of the agent tool field, organized in five sections. Section 1 covers terminal coding agents (Codex CLI at 86K stars, Hermes Agent formerly OpenClaw at 170K stars, Aider at 45K stars, Goose cross-ref). Section 2 covers autonomous coding agents (Devin with cloud sandbox and ACU billing, SWE-agent Princeton NeurIPS 2024, Claude Code headless cross-ref). Section 3 covers multi-agent frameworks (CrewAI 52K stars, LangGraph 33K stars, AutoGen/Microsoft Agent Framework). Section 4 covers orchestration tooling (Conductor Gemini methodology, Conductor Microsoft YAML CLI, Hermes Control Room community template). Section 5 is a decision framework with a full comparison matrix (10 tools across 7 dimensions) and a situation-to-tool guide. Cross-refs added to ai-ecosystem.md (Section 11, Section 11.3), third-party-tools.md (Multi-Agent Orchestration), and guide/README.md navigation.

### Security

- **New section 1.6 in security-hardening.md**: Third-Party Command Wrappers & Shell Interceptors. Covers the attack surface of token-saving wrappers (RTK and similar), shell function overrides (oh-my-zsh plugins), completion frameworks (Fig, Warp), and how to audit each. Includes supply chain hygiene for CLI tools (`brew pin`, `cargo --locked`, checksum verification), minimal shell setup for sensitive sessions, and context separation (no production credentials in agent sessions).

### Added

- **stacklit, scip-search, lilmd** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`, `guide/workflows/search-tools-mastery.md`, 2026-05-27): Three community CLI tools added to the guide. stacklit generates a machine-readable repo index (~250 tokens vs 50K+ for manual exploration) and auto-configures Claude Code/Cursor/Aider; documented in context-engineering-tools.md section 3 alongside RTK/context-mode. scip-search queries pre-built SCIP symbol indexes with millisecond cold starts, no MCP required, worktree-compatible; positioned as a stateless alternative to Serena for CI and ephemeral environments. lilmd provides Markdown TOC with inclusive line ranges for targeted section reads, filling a gap in documentation navigation. Both scip-search and lilmd added to search-tools-mastery.md with decision tree, setup priority, and a new Extended Toolkit section; title updated from "4-Tool Symphony" to "6-Tool Toolkit".

- **Section 2.10 Prompt Engineering Patterns** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, new `## 2.10`): Four techniques for closing the gap between well-structured prompts and reliably accurate outputs. Few-shot prompting: message-pair format for tool-use tasks, null-handling example strategy, false-positive calibration with near-miss examples, limits of few-shot vs schema constraints. Validation retry loop: three-attempt budget with per-field error feedback, hallucination cycle detection (`is_hallucination_cycle`), graceful degradation to human review queue. Self-review contamination: 15-30% self-preference bias, independent review instance pattern for high-stakes extraction. Inline reasoning for triage: `reasoning` field in output schema as verification handle, vague reasoning as escalation signal.

- **Section 2.11 Structured Outputs & Schema Design** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, new `## 2.11`): Confidence calibration with labeled validation sets, bucket-based accuracy vs confidence measurement (`calibrate_confidence`), per-field review thresholds (vendor 0.70, date 0.80, financial amount 0.95), accuracy vs confidence plot interpretation (Platt scaling for systematic overconfidence/underconfidence). Calibration baseline requires 200+ labeled examples per field for statistically actionable buckets.

- **`context: fork` documentation** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, Skills frontmatter table): New row documenting `context: fork` as a CC-only field that runs the skill in an isolated subagent where only the final response returns to the parent context. Documents the known limitation: `context: fork` is ignored when the skill is invoked via the `Skill` tool in agent code and only activates as a slash command.

- **Message Batches API cross-reference** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, section 9.9): Added note to Batch Operations intro pointing to `client.messages.batches` for cost-optimized bulk API processing (up to 100 requests, 50% cost reduction vs synchronous).

- Renumbered existing sections: `## 2.10 Data Flow & Privacy` to `## 2.12`, `## 2.11 Under the Hood` to `## 2.13`. TOC and quick-jump line updated accordingly.

- **Anthropic API Patterns for Architects** (`guide/core/architecture.md`, new `## Anthropic API Patterns for Architects`): Three production-critical API patterns. Message Batches API: 50% cost reduction, 24-hour processing window, 100-request batches, per-request error isolation, retry economics at scale, use-case decision matrix (sync vs streaming vs batch). `tool_choice` parameter: four modes (auto/any/specific/none), forced structured output pattern via tool invocation, `stop_reason` guard. Strict mode JSON schema: `output-schema-2025-02-19` beta header, constrained decoding guarantees, nullable fields to prevent hallucination, extensible enums with companion `*_detail` field, `detected_pattern` for auditable classification pipelines.

- **`max_turns` guidance** (`guide/core/architecture.md`, agentic loop section): New `#### Controlling loop depth with max_turns` subsection. Recommended ranges (5 for simple retrieval, 20-30 for research, 50+ for extended workflows), `stop_reason == "max_turns"` check, and rationale for per-task-type configuration in multi-agent pipelines.

- **Attention Mechanics & Reliability** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md`, new `## 17. Attention Mechanics & Reliability`, 238 lines): Lost-in-the-middle mechanics (Liu et al. 2023, arXiv:2307.03172, U-shaped curve, 27% vs 98% NIAH accuracy gap). Primacy/recency placement (sandwich pattern, per-section pass for documents above 50K tokens). Context window size misconception (degradation begins around 50-70K tokens regardless of window size). Persistent facts block (verbatim inclusion, prompt-cache compatible, 500-token ceiling). Scratchpad pattern (synthetic assistant message, programmatic state updates, scratchpad vs rolling summary distinction). Rolling context summaries (65% trigger threshold, facts extraction before summarizing).

- **Production Reliability Patterns** (`guide/workflows/production-reliability.md`, new file, 558 lines): Escalation design (three canonical triggers: explicit request, policy gap, inability to progress), programmatic escalation signals vs LLM confidence scores, frustration vs explicit escalation distinction, rule-based routing from structured output fields. Circuit breaker (CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN state machine, per-document isolation). Structured error propagation (`StructuredAgentError` with `is_retryable`, `error_category`, `alternative_approach`). Partial results with coverage annotations (`well-supported`/`partially-supported`/`gap`). Structured human handoff (`HandoffPayload` with `recommended_next_action`). Source conflict resolution (temporal difference vs factual conflict, `publication_date` as mandatory field). Anti-patterns section.

- **Advanced Orchestration Patterns** (`guide/workflows/agent-teams.md`, new `## Advanced Orchestration Patterns`, 422 lines): Hub-and-spoke coordinator (coordinator decomposes/dispatches/aggregates, never does domain work). Programmatic prerequisites (state-flag gate, phase-based dispatch with `PipelinePhase` enum). Dynamic subagent selection (`DynamicSelector` with economy/performance/balanced routing). Research space partitioning (explicit topic assignment per agent, exclusion lists). Crash recovery manifest (`PipelineManifest` with `checkpoint()` and `mark_item_complete()`, `RecoverableOrchestrator`). Iterative refinement loop (numeric `target_quality` and `max_iterations` hard budget). Narrow task decomposition (SPEC test: Specific, Programmatically Evaluable, Explicit scope, Constrained).

- **Advanced MCP Tool Design** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`, new `## Advanced MCP Tool Design`, 251 lines): `isRetryable` as application-level convention via `structuredContent` (not native MCP spec). `isError: false` + empty vs `isError: true` semantics table with JSON examples. MCP Resources vs Tools formal comparison (6-dimension table, Python implementation, ResourceLink bridge). Tool naming conflicts with system prompt keywords (naming rules, domain-prefix convention). Task-scoped tool profiles (exploration/analysis/execution phases, role-based access, `verify_fact` subagent pattern).

### Added

- **Memory Systems canonical reference page** (`guide/core/memory-systems.md`, ~2,500 lines): Consolidates all memory content previously scattered across 15+ locations in 6+ files. Covers three tracks: Native Stack (CLAUDE.md, Auto Memory v2.1.59+, Auto Dream, Agent Memory frontmatter, session vs persistent), Cross-Session Tools (claude-mem, agentmemory, ICM, Kairn, doobidoo, OpenMemory MCP, 7 others with master comparison table), and Team Sharing (Trinity pattern, Mem0 Cloud MCP, Zep/Graphiti, Notion MCP approach, structural gap analysis). Adds net-new content not previously in the guide: agentmemory BM25+vector+graph RRF architecture, five architecture patterns, multi-agent coordination patterns (MCP blackboard, leases+signals, A2A), memory poisoning/prompt injection risk (Section 7.1), SAMEP protocol, decision flowchart (Mermaid), 18-row decision matrix, LongMemEval benchmarks, ACT-R decay model, 6 open problems.
  - `machine-readable/reference.yaml`: 30 new entries under `deep_dive:` (memory_systems_guide through memory_systems_open_problems)
  - `guide/README.md`: New row in Core Reference table
  - `guide/learning-path/03-memory.md`: New "Going Further" section (~30 lines) covering Auto Memory, cross-session tools, and team sharing with links
  - `guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`: Section 7 updated to point to canonical page, adds three-tier model summary
  - `guide/diagrams/02-context-and-sessions.md`: Memory Hierarchy diagram click URLs updated to memory-systems.md
  - `guide/ultimate-guide.md`: Seven sections reduced to summaries with cross-references (CLAUDE.md memory, Auto Memory + Auto Dream, claude-mem, doobidoo, Kairn, ICM, MCP Memory Stack patterns); two sections (Agent Memory, Session vs Persistent) received "See also" links

### Added

- **Interactive MCP or CLI quiz** (`cc.bruniaux.com/mcp-or-cli/`): 6-question quiz giving a personalized recommendation (MCP-First, CLI-First, or Hybrid Workflow). Scoring weights across six dimensions: user type, auth model, model tier, observability requirements, CLI landscape, and team scale. Results include a match percentage, actionable tips, and a link to the relevant guide section. Added to the More dropdown in the landing nav.

- **"The API wrapper pattern" section** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`): New section clarifying that most production MCP servers wrap existing REST or GraphQL APIs, confirmed by official documentation from Notion ("converted MCP tool calls into HTTP API calls to Notion's public API"), Sentry ("middleware to the upstream Sentry API"), Slack ("a wrapper around an external API, like Slack"), and GitHub ("integrates with GitHub via the GitHub API"). Explains what MCP adds on top of the raw API (OAuth token management, LLM-tuned schemas, centralized hosting, usage attribution) and sharpens the decision criterion: if a service authenticates via API key and you don't need centralized observability, a CLI calling the same API is functionally equivalent.

### Documentation

- **MCP vs CLI guide updated (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`)**: Three additions. (1) "Per-server recommendation" table: 18 popular MCP servers each with a concrete verdict (Use MCP / Use CLI / Depends), the named CLI alternative, and a one-line reason. Services with mature CLIs the model knows from training (GitHub, GitLab, git, docker, aws-cli, terraform, semgrep, filesystem) lean CLI. Services requiring OAuth or with no CLI (Sentry, Slack, Notion, Google Drive, Figma, Linear, Context7) lean MCP. Playwright and Kubernetes are context-dependent. Includes a callout linking to the interactive quiz at cc.bruniaux.com/mcp-or-cli/. (2) "MCP vs Skills" section clarifying that skills (markdown workflow instructions) and MCP (execution/auth connectivity) address different layers, not alternatives. OAuth 2.1 subsection explains why MCP is the only option for enterprise SaaS APIs that require browser redirects or server-held refresh tokens. (3) Updated mcp2cli Tooling table entry from watch-list status (1.2K stars, 8 days old) to current state (~1.9K stars, Show HN Best of March 2026, independently benchmarked by Firecrawl/Scalekit/CircleCI). Updated "Last updated" date. Added `mcp-vs-cli.md` pointer block to `machine-readable/reference.yaml` (8 new entries). Added `third_party_mcp2cli_evaluation` and `third_party_mcp2cli_score` to `reference.yaml` (2 previously missing entries).

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.150
  - v2.1.149: `/usage` per-category breakdown (skills, subagents, plugins, per-MCP-server cost), GFM task list checkboxes render natively, Enterprise `allowAllClaudeAiMcps` setting, two security fixes (PowerShell `cd` permission bypass, sandbox worktree write allowlist), 20+ bug fixes (`/diff` keyboard scrolling, transcript view freeze, slash-command arg hints, `/config` phantom changes, `/insights` crash, otelHeadersHelper path-with-spaces)
  - v2.1.150: Internal infrastructure improvements (no user-facing changes)

### Added

- **Auto mode documentation expanded across 4 files**: Comprehensive update covering two-layer architecture (input probe + Sonnet 4.6 transcript classifier), three classifier categories (scope escalation, untrusted infrastructure, prompt injection), Anthropic's production numbers (94% detection, 17% FNR), independent stress-test findings (arXiv 2604.04978: 81% FNR on adversarial workloads, 92.9% FNR gap on file edits exempt from classification), escalation mechanism (3 consecutive or 20 total blocks), red spinner signal, `autoMode.allow/soft_deny/environment` with `"$defaults"` sentinel, and when-to-use taxonomy.
  - `guide/ultimate-guide.md`: Section rewritten from ~30 to ~80 lines
  - `guide/cheatsheet.md`: Auto mode row added to permission modes table
  - `whitepapers/fr/03-securite.qmd`: New "Mode Auto: délégation et limites réelles" subsection; sandbox Modes bullet fixed (was conflating sandbox auto-allow with auto mode permission feature); PermissionDenied hook updated
  - `whitepapers/en/03-security.qmd`: Same changes in English

- **Pinning Opus 4.6 (Community Hack)** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Added subsection in the OpusPlan Mode area documenting three ways to force Opus 4.6 instead of 4.7 (settings.json direct, OpusPlan hybrid via `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, per-session `/model`). Documents the trade-offs: losing `xhigh`/`max` effort levels and the newer knowledge cutoff. Added cross-reference from the pricing section.

- **Copilot instructions file** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`): Points Copilot users to `/CLAUDE.md` as the source of truth and reminds contributors to update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **YouTube Skills for Claude Code** (`README.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Added [youtube-skills](https://github.com/ZeroPointRepo/youtube-skills) to the community resources and Awesome Lists sections — 12 skills for YouTube search, transcripts, chapters, and content analysis.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/generate-guide-exports.sh` — PDF build fails with Typst 0.14+** (`font fallback list must not be empty`). Pandoc's default Typst template leaves `mainfont`/`monofont` empty unless they are set via metadata, and Typst 0.14 made an empty font list a hard error (it was tolerated in 0.13, which is the version bundled with current Quarto on macOS). Added `-V mainfont="Libertinus Serif"` and `-V monofont="DejaVu Sans Mono"` to the `pandoc` invocation — both fonts are available out of the box on macOS and on Ubuntu (`fonts-libertinus` is pulled in by the `pandoc` apt package, `fonts-dejavu` is preinstalled). Verified end-to-end on Ubuntu 25.10 with pandoc 3.1.11 + standalone Typst 0.14.2: PDF builds successfully (556 pages, 8.4 MB) from `guide/ultimate-guide.md` v3.40.0.

### Documentation

- **METR 2026 update integrated in `guide/roles/adoption-approaches.md`**: Added note on METR Study 2 outcome (February 2026, abandoned due to selection bias when 30-50% of participants refused to work without AI). Partial data from the 10 developers common to both studies showed results consistent with Study 1. Newer participants showed a narrower gap (-4%, IC -15% to +9%) and some subgroups improved by up to +18 percentage points relative to Study 1's -19% baseline. METR qualifies this partial data as "very weak evidence." Source: metr.org/blog/2026-02-24-uplift-update/.

- **Agentic Metrics section (new in `guide/ops/team-metrics.md`)**: New section "Agentic Metrics: What DORA Doesn't Measure" covering three metric groups. (1) RCT-verifiable metrics with published baselines: task completion time (METR -19%, arXiv 2507.09089), PR cycle time (DeputyDev -31.8%, arXiv 2509.19708), pass rate with executable test oracle (c-CRAB: Claude Code 32.1%, union of four tools 41.5%, arXiv 2603.23448). (2) Agentic pipeline metrics: spec quality score, validation contract pass rate (Factory.ai Missions), agent task completion rate, code review recall (Code Review Bench Martian: Augment 62.8% recall, Copilot 53.3%, 200,000+ open-source PRs), cost per completed task. (3) Agent governance metrics from Strata Identity Research 2026 and CSA/Zenity 2026 (53% organizations experienced an agent incident in 12 months, 58% took more than 5 hours to detect). Includes the heavy-user review time contradiction (Digital Applied Q1 2026: heavy users spend 14-16h/week reviewing AI-generated code vs 11.4h average), and pass^k pattern for non-deterministic test suites. Table of Contents updated accordingly.

- **Harness Engineer formal framework in `guide/roles/ai-roles.md` (§10)**: Extended the Harness Engineer section with a new subsection documenting the three formal properties from arXiv 2605.18747 "Code as Agent Harness" (May 2026): executability (harness runs and objectively verifies code), inspectability (every agent step is traceable; gen_ai.client stable, gen_ai.agent experimental in OTel GenAI SIG as of May 2026), and statefulness (continuity between sessions and calls). Includes Martin Fowler citation ("A raw model is not an agent. It becomes one when connected to a harness.") and list of the nine prod-grade harness components.

- **Agent Harness Engineering (new page `guide/core/agent-harness.md`)**: New reference page covering the nine-component framework (while-loop engine, context management, tool registry, sub-agent management, built-in skills, session persistence, dynamic prompt assembly, lifecycle hooks, permission enforcement) and the three foundational properties from arXiv 2605.18747 (executability, inspectability, statefulness). Includes the Lethal Trifecta security model (Willison), CI/CD agentic patterns comparison (GitHub Agentic Workflows / AWS Bedrock AgentCore / GitLab Duo), digital twin testing landscape by service (Slack-Mock, Mockoon, WireMock), OTel GenAI observability stack (gen_ai.client stable, gen_ai.agent experimental as of May 2026), test distribution anti-pattern (70% effort on deterministic / <5% on LLM reasoning), and creator-verifier pattern (+12 to +26% correctness improvement). 8 new anchors added to `machine-readable/reference.yaml`.

- **L0-L5 Shapiro Scale in `guide/roles/adoption-approaches.md`**: New section "The L0-L5 Scale: Where Is Your Team?" documenting the six-level framework by Dan Shapiro (CEO Glowforge, January 2026, factorydark.com) with correct attribution. Includes adoption data (Stack Overflow 2025 n=49,000+: 84% declared adoption but 77% don't use vibe coding, 31% use agents — estimated L3+ penetration under 10%), the J-curve from McElheran/Yang/Kroff/Brynjolfsson 2025 (-1.33 TFP point at short-term, Census Bureau data), METR RCT calibration (n=16, 246 tasks, +19% measured slowdown vs -20% perceived, 39-point perception gap), DeputyDev longitudinal cohort (arXiv 2509.19708: 4% month 1, 83% month 6, 60% steady-state, -31.8% PR cycle time), and level-specific investment guidance.

- **Three new roles in `guide/roles/ai-roles.md`**: Added sections 17 (Spec Engineer), 18 (Agent Identity Architect), 19 (AI Eval Engineer) with full responsibilities, required skills, entry paths, and salary estimates. Updated Career Decision Matrix and salary benchmark table. Old sections 17-20 renumbered to 20-23. New roles added to `machine-readable/reference.yaml`.

- **SDD 2026 findings in `guide/workflows/spec-first.md`**: New section "SDD vs TDD vs BDD" with comparative table on governing artifacts, Factory.ai Missions architecture (orchestrator + workers + adversarial validators, 81 problems caught pre-merge on documented Slack clone generating 34% of implementation work), multi-file pass@1 failure rates, and spec drift as the primary open problem.

- **Context Engineering: ACE-v2 operational layer (Sections 10-14)**: Extended `guide/core/context-engineering.md` with five new sections covering the operational mechanisms that close the gap between Level 4 and Level 5 in the maturity model. (1) Signal taxonomy and causal attribution: five-category friction taxonomy (syntactic/semantic/procedural/alignment/performance) replacing the flat `errors × 3 + retries × 2` score, plus a YAML event schema and per-pattern tracking dict. (2) Loop closure: PR-based Curator mechanism generating config-change PRs with diff, canary A/B results, friction evidence, and suggestion escalation; multi-timescale operation (real-time/weekly/quarterly); signal locality trade-offs (local cron vs pushed store vs hosted env). (3) Ejection: automated detection of dormant rules and negative-ROI skills for archival — three heuristics: activation threshold, ROI tracking, profile overlap. (4) Constitutional and self-consistency audits: pre-PR rule conflict check against an explicit `constitution.md`, plus a weekly check verifying that ACE documentation claims match the measured state. (5) Multi-dev profile reconciliation: detection of rules present in more than 50% of individual profiles with hoist-to-shared-config proposals; Bash script included. Old sections 10-12 renumbered to 15-17. ACE disambiguation (vs arXiv:2510.04618 inference-time technique) added to Section 6 and glossary. Five new anchors added to `machine-readable/reference.yaml`. Cross-link added in `guide/roles/ai-roles.md`. Landing `/context-engineering/` updated with ACE Operations category. Landing `/context/` result screen updated with two new deep links.

- **Landing nav and banner**: Replaced "Learning" with "Context" in main nav; reordered More dropdown (AI Roles, Methodologies, Ecosystem, Releases, Compare, Diagrams, Team Metrics, Glossary, FAQ, RSS Feed); updated announcement banner to highlight Agent Harness Engineering, ACE-v2, and new AI roles; fixed banner deep link from `/guide/core/agent-harness` to `/guide/agent-harness/` (guide files served flat by prepare-guide-content.mjs).

- **Quiz category 16 "Agent Harness & Context"**: 35 new questions covering Agent Harness Engineering (9-component framework, Lethal Trifecta, CI/CD patterns, creator-verifier +12 to +26%, Safe Outputs toolchain, OTel GenAI status), Context Engineering (L0-L5 maturity scale, ACE-v2 signal taxonomy, loop closure PR curation, ejection thresholds, constitutional audits, self-consistency check, multi-dev profile reconciliation), and the three new AI roles (Spec Engineer, Agent Identity Architect, AI Eval Engineer). Quiz total 271 to 306 questions.

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.146 (2026-05-21)
  - v2.1.146: `/simplify` renamed to `/code-review` with optional effort level; auto mode no longer suppresses AskUserQuestion; Windows PowerShell regression fix; 15+ bug fixes
  - v2.1.145: `claude agents --json` for scripting; `/plugin` previews before install; security fix for Bash permission-prompt bypass; MCP paginated resources fix; 20+ bug fixes
  - v2.1.144: /resume lists background sessions alongside interactive ones; /model session-only by default; "extra usage" → "usage credits"; 75s startup hang fixed; 40+ bug fixes

### Changed

- **Commands migrated to skills — redirect stubs + full reference update**: All 51 files in `examples/commands/` are now redirect stubs pointing to their canonical `examples/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` equivalents, following the Claude Code 2.1.3 skills-commands unification. Existing GitHub URLs remain valid. `threat-db.yaml` copied to `examples/skills/update-threat-db/threat-db.yaml` (original kept until MCP server Chantier 2). Updated `machine-readable/reference.yaml` (26 keys), `llms.txt`, `machine-readable/llms.txt`, `README.md`, `scripts/install-templates.sh` (install_command → install_skill redirect + subdir format), `scripts/check-landing-sync.sh` (excludes stubs from template count), `scripts/generate-template-catalog.py`, `scripts/resync-reference-yaml.py`. New script: `scripts/generate-command-stubs.py` (idempotent stub generator). Landing `cc.bruniaux.com`: updated `guide-search-entries.ts` (26 deep links), `learning/index.astro`, `security-data.ts`, `guide-content-entries.ts`, and all template count references (181 → 255). Remaining in Chantier 2: MCP server rebuild + threat-db.yaml original deletion. Remaining in Chantier 3: guide prose, quiz YAML, whitepapers, and `.claude/` internal paths.

- **`tools/audit-prompt.md` updated to v5.2 for CC 2.1.3 skills model**: Dimension 4 fallback bash now counts `.claude/skills/` alongside agents/commands; Dimension 7 workflow detection checks `skills/$cmd/SKILL.md` (both project and global) in addition to `commands/$cmd.md`; security-check install command fixed (output file was `security-check.md`, now correctly `SKILL.md`); Dimension 8 argument-hint note clarifies that skills use `effort:` field instead. Version footer bumped to v5.2.

- **`tools/onboarding-prompt.md` guide line count corrected**: "22K+ lines" → "25K+ lines" to match current `guide/ultimate-guide.md` size.

### Fixed

- **Mass broken-link repair across guide and examples** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.fr.md`, `guide/security/security-hardening.md`, `guide/cowork.md`, `guide/ops/observability.md`, `guide/ops/ai-traceability.md`, `guide/ops/devops-sre.md`, `examples/CATALOG.md`, and 15+ additional example files): Fixed 230+ broken internal relative paths caused by guide reorganization from flat structure to nested subdirectories (`guide/roles/`, `guide/core/`, `guide/ecosystem/`, `guide/security/`, `guide/ops/`). Fixes applied: `../core/` refs in `guide/`-root files corrected to `core/`; `../examples/` in `guide/security/` and `guide/ops/` corrected to `../../examples/`; `../../examples/` in `guide/ultimate-guide.md` corrected to `../examples/`; bare `ai-ecosystem.md`, `observability.md`, `production-safety.md`, `sandbox-isolation.md` refs prefixed with their subdirectory; `../guide/` in `examples/agents/` and `examples/plugins/` corrected to `../../guide/`; all 181 CATALOG.md links had `examples/` prefix stripped (file lives in `examples/`); corrupted `](` in `security-hardening.md` MCP safe list footer repaired. Added `https://quarto.org` to `.lycheeignore` to suppress CI network flakiness. Staged `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-05-18-skillsight-packmind.md` to resolve dead internal reference in `third-party-tools.md`.

- **Monthly link checker deployed to cc-copilot-bridge landing** (`cc-copilot-bridge-landing/.github/workflows/link-check.yml`): Monthly cron + `workflow_run` on deploy + `workflow_dispatch` crawling `ccbridge.bruniaux.com`. Validated end-to-end: clean run on first try, zero broken links.

- **Monthly link checker deployed to ccboard landing** (`ccboard-landing/.github/workflows/link-check.yml`): Monthly cron + `workflow_run` on deploy + `workflow_dispatch` crawling `ccboard.bruniaux.com`. Validated end-to-end: clean run on first try, zero broken links.

- **Monthly link checker deployed to portfolio** (`portfolio-florian/.github/workflows/link-check.yml`): Monthly cron + `workflow_dispatch` crawling `florian.bruniaux.com`. No `workflow_run` trigger (Vercel deploy, not trackable from GitHub Actions). Excluded `npmjs.com` (bot-protection 403 false positive). Validated end-to-end: clean run confirms zero broken links.

- **Monthly link checker deployed to cowork landing** (`claude-cowork-guide-landing/.github/workflows/link-check.yml`): Monthly cron (1st of month, 08:00 UTC) crawling `cowork.bruniaux.com`. Triggers on deploy success and `workflow_dispatch`. Fixed one pre-existing 404 in `src/data/i18n.ts` (`01-getting-started.en.md` → `01-getting-started.md`). Validated end-to-end: clean run confirms zero broken links.

- **CI link checker now creates issues on broken links** (`claude-code-ultimate-guide-landing/.github/workflows/link-check.yml`): The lychee step was missing `id: lychee`, so `steps.lychee.outputs.exit_code` was always undefined and the issue-creation condition `null != 0` evaluated to false — broken links were silently ignored. Added `id: lychee` to the step. Validated end-to-end: a deliberate broken link triggered issue #6 automatically, then was removed. At least 5 past "fix broken link" commits confirm this silent failure had real impact.

- **Broken links fixed across guide and FR translation** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.fr.md`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`, `guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`, `examples/workflows/database-branch-setup.md`, `examples/config/CONTRIBUTING-ai-disclosure.md`): Fixed 10+ dead URLs detected by the new link checker: `florian.bruniaux.com/guides` redirected to `cc.bruniaux.com/whitepapers/`, `platform.claude.com/docs/model-deprecations` corrected to full path `/docs/en/release-notes/model-deprecations`, `neon.tech/docs/guides/branching` updated to `neon.com/docs/introduction/branching`, `docs.sentry.io/integrations/mcp/` corrected to `docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-mcp/`, and `ai-traceability.md` path fixed. Added `.lycheeignore` for 26 historical dead references that credit real sources. Added HTTP 202 to accepted codes in lychee workflow (europarl.europa.eu returns 202). All fixes applied in both EN and FR translation files.

- **Link checker added to main guide repo** (`.github/workflows/link-check.yml`): Monthly cron (1st of month, 08:00 UTC) scanning `guide/**/*.md` and `examples/**/*.md`. Two-step detection: (1) lychee for HTTP external links — accepts 200, 202, 206, 302, 403, 429; excludes social media, localhost, template patterns, file://; (2) `markdown-link-check` for internal relative file links (pointer errors) — ignores HTTP/anchors since those are already covered. Each step creates its own GitHub issue on failure.

- **Link checker added to StarMapper** (`starmapper/.github/workflows/link-check.yml`): Monthly cron scanning `starmapper.bruniaux.com`. SHA-pinned actions (Dependabot active). Validated via `workflow_dispatch` — clean run confirmed.

### Added

- **Skillsight documented** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): Added new "Skills Observability" section (#15 in TOC) covering Skillsight (PackmindHub/skillsight, v0.2.1, Apache 2.0) by Cédric Teyton (Packmind). Documents both ingestion modes (OTLP direct push from Claude Code and Loki pull from Grafana Cloud), full settings.json snippet for Claude Code configuration, 5-step setup workflow, and three mandatory deployment caveats (default JWT_SECRET/ADMIN_PASSWORD must be overridden — no boot warning; PUBLIC_BASE_URL required for CORS safety and correct onboarding snippet; Drizzle migrations not automatic at startup). Updated Known Gaps table (skills usage analytics filled), Recommendations by Persona table (team skills adoption row added), and cross-reference to Packmind ContextOps (#076). Resource evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-05-18-skillsight-packmind.md` (3/5 — integrate with caveats; promote to 4/5 when boot-time default detection, separate encryption key, and automatic migrations are shipped).

- **`/goal` command documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §9.17, `guide/cheatsheet.md`, `whitepapers/en/00-series-introduction.qmd`, `whitepapers/en/01-effective-prompts.qmd`, `whitepapers/fr/00-introduction-serie.qmd`, `whitepapers/fr/01-prompts-efficaces.qmd`): Expanded the existing stub into a full deep-dive covering the evaluator model architecture (separate Haiku model, condition-based termination vs `/loop`'s time-based), three-element goal formulation (measurable end state + verification mechanism + constraints), `/goal clear` and `/goal status` management commands, anti-patterns (vague objectives, judgment-heavy tasks, production data), permission boundary clarification, context rot warning (~20 turns), and the Orchestrator + `claude -p` mitigation pattern. Added `/goal` to the agentic capabilities table in both introduction whitepapers (EN + FR). Added `/goal` section to the Automation sections of both `01-effective-prompts` (EN) and `01-prompts-efficaces` (FR), including callout memo entries. Added `/goal` row to the "Features Méconnues" table in the cheatsheet.

- **Graphify internals and skill mechanics documented** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): Added "Under the hood" table explaining the 7 hidden cache files in `graphify-out/` (`.graphify_ast.json` = tree-sitter AST, `.graphify_chunk_XX.json` = AI-processed batches, `.chunk_manifest_XX.json` = per-chunk file lists for `--update` targeting, `.graphify_semantic.json` = post-dedup embeddings, `cache/` = content hashes). Added `--update` mechanics explanation (hash comparison, per-chunk re-processing, zero API cost for unchanged files). Expanded MCP server section with large-graph guidance (5 MB threshold, skill-only vs MCP token cost tradeoff). Added "How Claude uses the installed skill" section documenting the 3-step resolution order: GRAPH_REPORT.md first, targeted graph.json sections, then MCP tools at scale.

- **Graphify documented** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): Added new "Knowledge Graph" section (#13 in TOC) covering Graphify (safishamsi/graphify, v0.8.9, MIT, PyPI: `graphifyy`). Documents the full init workflow (`graphify .` → `graphify install --platform claude` → `--update` for incremental rebuilds), the 3 core output files (graph.html, GRAPH_REPORT.md, graph.json), query commands, god nodes/surprising connections/confidence tagging analysis features, MCP server mode, file support across 31 languages plus PDFs/videos, team workflow via committed `graphify-out/`, privacy model (code local via tree-sitter, docs go to AI API), and the double-y PyPI naming trap. Updated frontmatter description, TOC, and Recommendations by Persona table.

- **Step by Token documented** (`guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md` §16, `guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`): Added section covering Dimitri Mérault's free 21-chapter interactive guide to LLM mechanics (stepbytoken.com). Covers all 4 parts (model anatomy, training and alignment, production, advanced topics) with a Claude Code-specific chapter relevance table highlighting context windows (ch9), agents and MCP (ch11), prompt engineering (ch12), hallucinations (ch13), extended reasoning/thinking tokens (ch17), and KV cache (ch18). Also added cross-reference link in the External Resources section of the learning-with-ai guide.

- **Four new token/cost tracking tools documented** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): Added Claude Code Usage Monitor (~7,955 stars, real-time burn-rate predictions, highest-starred tool in category), claude-spend (one-shot `npx claude-spend` check), cc-statistics (cross-agent dashboard covering Claude Code + Gemini CLI + Codex + Cursor), and claude-context-optimizer (context heatmaps, wasted context detection, git-aware ROI reports). Added explanatory note on the Layer 4 billing blind spot: API-level gateways cannot intercept Claude Max/Pro subscription traffic; local file-parsing tools work billing-mode-agnostically.

- **context-mode documented** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md` §3): New subsection covering context-mode (mksglu/context-mode, ~14,149 stars, ELv2), the MCP server with output sandbox compression, SQLite+FTS5 session tracking with BM25 retrieval post-`/compact`, and the "Think in Code" pattern. Includes comparison with RTK and Headroom. Platform count: 12 supported platforms including Claude Code plugin, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Kiro, Zed.

- **mem0 documented as ICM alternative** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md` §7): Added mem0 (mem0ai/mem0, ~55,228 stars) as a provider-agnostic, cloud-portable alternative to ICM. Includes decision guide table (ICM vs mem0 by use case), token overhead figure (~10-15%/turn), and architectural differentiation (ICM local-first/Claude-specific vs mem0 multi-provider/portable).

- **KV Cache section expanded with Claude Code-specific prompt caching mechanics** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md` §8): New subsections covering: KV tensor mechanics (Key-Value matrices in VRAM, ~500MB-1GB for 100K-token Opus prefix), Claude Code request ordering (system prompt, tool definitions, CLAUDE.md as message content, conversation history), rationale for CLAUDE.md placement (shared system prompt cache across all users), production 96% hit rate, cache anti-patterns (timestamps in system prompt, mid-session tool changes), Plan Mode cache-stable design (EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode rather than removing tools), and compaction vs `/clear` cache continuity. Added "Self-Hosted KV Cache Infrastructure" subsection header to separate Claude-specific content from vLLM/SGLang content.

- **"Think in Code" pattern documented** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md` §8): New named subsection covering the pattern coined by context-mode v1.0.64 and independently described by Contieri as "Ask for the Analyst, Not the Analysis." Documents the problem (30+ file reads for an exploratory task), the pattern (write and run a script, read only the result), three bash examples, when to apply it, and relationship to sub-agents.

- **Graduated Context Offloading documented** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md` §8): New named subsection covering the three-tier cascade from LangGraph's Deep Agents SDK: Tier 1 (large tool outputs over 20K tokens offloaded to filesystem with path+preview injected), Tier 2 (accumulated tool call arguments dropped when context hits mid-point), Tier 3 (lossy message history summarization as last resort). Includes Claude Code-equivalent PostToolUse hook implementation in Python that transparently intercepts large bash outputs and writes them to temp files. Summary table and highest-leverage sequence updated to include both new patterns.

- **MECW (Maximum Effective Context Window) documented** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md` §2): New subsection establishing that the effective ceiling is approximately 92% of the advertised limit (185K for Claude Opus 4's 200K window) before accuracy degrades. Covers the context rot mechanism (30%+ degradation in mid-window positions), the signal-to-noise argument against naive 1M window reliance, and planning targets per model.

- **lean-ctx section rewritten with measured benchmarks** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): Replaced simulated benchmark figures with measured data from a TypeScript/T3 monorepo (2455 files, 7063-node graph): 57.8% overall compression, 86% savings rate on ctx_read, schema.prisma 2364L → ~200 tokens (99%), cache re-reads at 13 tokens. Updated install command to the official curl script + `lean-ctx setup`. Added RTK vs lean-ctx two-layer comparison table (RTK = CLI output, lean-ctx = file reads + session memory), monitoring commands, and cross-reference to context-engineering.md §12. Replaced Caution warning with a measured maintenance note.

- **Token Compression Tools section added** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md` §12): New section covering the two-layer token compression stack for Claude Code. Layer 1 (RTK): CLI output compression via PreToolUse hook, 60-90% savings on git/cargo/npm. Layer 2 (lean-ctx): file read compression via tree-sitter AST, 10 ctx_read modes with selection guide (signatures/map/full/diff/lines:N-M), cache mechanics, CCP cross-session memory, and measured benchmarks. Includes savings distribution table (85% of lean-ctx savings from file reads vs <1% from shell), per-mode guidance for when to use each, and decision criteria by project type. TOC updated to add §11 Research Patterns and §12 Token Compression Tools.

- **lean-ctx referenced in machine-readable index** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`): Added 5-key entry for lean-ctx (yvgude/lean-ctx, 1 366 stars) under Third-Party Tools — local-first Rust CLI for context compression (60-95% token reduction claimed). Status: watch list, not yet integrated (breaking changes frequent, recent security fixes). Most direct RTK competitor identified in the context engineering tool landscape.
- **mcp2cli referenced in machine-readable index** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`): Added 5-key entry for mcp2cli (knowsuchagency/mcp2cli, ~1 900 stars, Show HN Best March 2026) — CLI bridge that lazy-loads MCP/OpenAPI/GraphQL tool schemas so LLM context only receives tool list and on-demand help strings instead of full schema injection each turn. 96-99% schema-token reduction benchmarked independently by Firecrawl, Scalekit, and CircleCI. Key nuance: 4+ unrelated forks share the same name; knowsuchagency is the reference implementation. Scoped to dev/single-tenant; not a replacement for enterprise MCP gateways with per-user OAuth and audit logs.
- **Context Compression section added to Third-Party Tools** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): New section between Token & Cost Tracking and Session Management, documenting lean-ctx (4-dimension Rust compression CLI: file read modes, shell modules, CCP session cache, SQLite property graph; watch-list status with caveats) and mcp2cli (Python CLI bridge solving MCP schema injection via lazy loading; independently benchmarked 32× token reduction on GitHub MCP server; naming collision warning for the 4+ unrelated forks). Table of Contents and frontmatter description updated.

### Changed

- **Skills–Commands unification (CC 2.1.3)**: All educational content updated to reflect that `.claude/commands/` is merged into `.claude/skills/`. The 3-way Agent/Skill/Command model is now a 2-way Agent/Skill model with invocation modes (`disable-model-invocation: true` for user-only, default for model-invocable). Affected: `guide/cheatsheet.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §5/§6, `whitepapers/fr+en` WP02/04/07, recap cards c04/m09/m10/01-commandes (FR+EN), landing docs mirrors, landing Q&A, machine-readable index. New editorial reference: `claudedocs/pedagogy-skills-merger.md`.

### Security

- **Threat database updated to v2.18.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`, `guide/security/security-hardening.md`): 7 new entries covering threats discovered after 2026-05-11:
  - **CVE-2026-42559** (RMCP Rust SDK DNS rebinding, CVSS 8.8, fixed in 1.4.0) — official Rust SDK for MCP lacked Host header validation, enabling DNS rebinding attacks; fixed in rmcp 1.4.0 (2026-05-14)
  - **CVE-2026-35568** (MCP Java SDK DNS rebinding, CVSS 7.6 v4, fixed in 1.0.0) — Java SDK variant of the same DNS rebinding class affecting all official SDK implementations
  - **CVE-2026-39313** (mcp-framework HTTP DoS, CWE-770, fixed in 0.2.22) — unlimited request body size in mcp-framework HTTP transport allows single-request memory exhaustion crash by unauthenticated attacker
  - **CVE-2026-25723** (Claude Code file-write sandbox bypass, fixed in 2.0.55) — piped sed/echo commands escaped project sandbox due to missing command-chain validation
  - **CVE-2026-33068** (Claude Code permission mode bypass, fixed in 2.1.53) — settings.json resolved before workspace trust dialog, allowing `bypassPermissions` to auto-approve all tool calls from malicious repos
  - **ADVISORY-CC-2026-002** (Claude Code 50-subcommand deny-rule bypass, fixed in 2.1.90) — all configured deny rules silently dropped when command chain exceeded 50 subcommands; discovered by Adversa after Claude Code source briefly exposed on npm
  - **T030 TrustFall** (Adversa, 2026-05-08) — malicious repos with crafted .claude/settings.json or .mcp.json auto-spawn attacker MCP servers when developer accepts folder trust dialog; affects Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, Copilot CLI; Anthropic declined to fix
  - Updated `minimum_safe_versions`: claude-code 2.1.34 → **2.1.90**, added rmcp 1.4.0, mcp-java-sdk 1.0.0, mcp-framework 0.2.22
  - Added 7 new sources: CVE-2026-42559, CVE-2026-35568, CVE-2026-39313, VentureBeat six-exploits article, Adversa TrustFall, AWS+Cisco MCP security blog

### Documentation

- **Four new guide sections: agentic SDK vocabulary, MCP error taxonomy, tool description patterns, context research patterns**:
  - **Agentic Loop API Vocabulary** (`guide/core/architecture.md` §1): new subsection naming `stop_reason` values (`end_turn`, `tool_use`, `max_tokens`) with loop pseudocode showing how each state maps to loop control flow, `tool_use` block structure (`id`, `name`, `input`), and `fork_session` explained as independent branch pattern analogous to git branching
  - **Hub-and-Spoke Orchestration** (`guide/core/architecture.md` §4): new subsection covering the dominant multi-agent pattern with ASCII diagram, coordinator responsibilities (decompose, pass context explicitly, aggregate, decide cross-cutting questions), worker isolation properties, and the critical rule that context is never inherited automatically between sub-agents — includes correct vs incorrect parallel task design example
  - **MCP Error Handling & Reliability** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md` Production Deployment §): new subsection covering the `isError` flag (why returning `isError: true` matters vs plain error strings), four-category error taxonomy (transient/validation/business/permission) with recovery strategies per category, and Python implementation pattern with explicit category tagging
  - **MCP Tool Description Design Patterns** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md` Production Deployment §): new subsection covering overlapping-description misrouting with bad/good examples, three-part description anatomy (what/what-input/decision-boundary), naming convention table (verb vs noun vs scope vs granularity suffixes), anti-patterns (generic verbs, missing boundary, boolean flags that change semantics), and `input_examples` as complement to descriptions
  - **Research Patterns: What the Literature Shows** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md` §11): new numbered section covering four research findings — Lost-in-the-Middle effect (Liu et al. 2023, Stanford) with practical positioning implications, progressive summarization risks (silent confidence with degrading accuracy, 2-pass limit recommendation), stratified sampling for calibration (stratum table by context length and instruction density), and claim-source mapping for provenance tracking in multi-step agents

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.143 (from v2.1.141)
  - v2.1.143: Plugin dependency enforcement (claude plugin disable/enable with transitive deps), projected context cost in /plugin marketplace, worktree.bgIsolation: "none" setting, PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass by default, stop hook block cap (warns after 8 blocks), 30+ bug fixes
  - v2.1.142: Fast mode upgraded to Opus 4.7 by default, new claude agents dispatch flags (--add-dir, --settings, --mcp-config, --model, --effort, --permission-mode), root-level SKILL.md plugin surfacing, /plugin shows LSP servers, MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT fix for remote servers, daemon cleanup on brew upgrade, 25+ bug fixes

- **claude-red offensive security skill library documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §Skills): new subsection "claude-red: Offensive Security Skill Library" covering SnailSploit/Claude-Red (58 skills across 13 attack surface categories). Documents three usage patterns — direct session read, `--system-file` at launch, and project-level `.claude/skills/` symlink — with emphasis on the one-shot no-install approach. Introduces the targeted prompt pattern for matching skills to a specific tech stack (Next.js/Prisma/Clerk example), and includes ethical/legal scope note.

- **Skills and Subagents section added to guide** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §5.1): new subsection "Skills and Subagents" documenting that subagents don't inherit skills automatically, built-in agents (Explorer, Plan, Verify) can't access skills at all, custom subagents need explicit `skills:` frontmatter field, and skills load at agent start (not on-demand). Includes frontmatter example. Based on Anthropic certification course module 05.

- **examples/skills — frontmatter cleanup (15 skills)**: added missing `allowed-tools` to guide-recap, issue-triage, landing-page-generator, pr-triage, release-notes-generator, skill-creator, cyber-defense-team, ccboard, rtk-optimizer; removed unsupported fields (`tags`, `category`, `keywords`, `context`, `agent`, `usage`, `args`) from ccboard, issue-triage, landing-page-generator, pr-triage, release-notes-generator, skill-creator, rtk-optimizer, token-audit, voice-refine, audit-agents-skills, mcp-integration-reference; fixed YAML list format (comma-separated → space-delimited) in git-ai-archaeology and audit-agents-skills; added `effort: medium` to git-ai-archaeology; moved `version` to `metadata.version` in rtk-optimizer, cyber-defense-team, audit-agents-skills, mcp-integration-reference. Note: `token-audit/skill.md` uses lowercase filename — spec requires exactly `SKILL.md`.

- **eval-skills improved** (`examples/skills/eval-skills/SKILL.md`): added `argument-hint` to frontmatter, fixed `allowed-tools` format (comma-separated → space-delimited), added "Pre-Check" section documenting `skills-ref validate` CLI, added complete list of valid vs unsupported frontmatter fields, added note about `allowed-tools` format requirement, added `model` as a valid Claude Code extension field, fixed per-skill output template from `/15` to `/14`.

- **Anthropic programmatic billing split documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §9.13, §9.3, §2.2, §10.4; `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): new section covering the June 15, 2026 billing change that separates interactive and programmatic usage into distinct buckets. Documents affected tools (`claude -p`, Agent SDK, GitHub Actions, third-party harnesses), credit amounts per plan, the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` billing trap, pre-June-15 audit steps, and decision framework for teams running automated workflows. Cross-references added in §2.2 (Cost Awareness), §9.3 (CI/CD), and §10.4 (Troubleshooting). 13 new entries in `reference.yaml`.

- **Agent Skills open standard — platform count corrected to 35+** (`machine-readable/reference.yaml`, `guide/ultimate-guide.md:7602`): updated from stale "26+" / "30+" counts based on official agentskills.io client showcase verified 2026-05-14 (35 named tools: added OpenHands, Amp, Letta, Junie, Firebender, OpenCode, Mux, Kiro, Snowflake Cortex Code, Ona, Laravel Boost, Emdash, TRAE, fast-agent, nanobot, VT Code, Qodo, Agentman, Mistral Vibe, Workshop, Command Code, pi, Piebald, Google AI Edge Gallery)

- **Claude Code releases updated to v2.1.141** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`):
  - v2.1.141: hook `terminalSequence` output field, `claude agents --cwd`, Rewind "Summarize up to here", `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_PREFER_HTTPS`, `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`, 50+ bug fixes
  - v2.1.140: `Agent` tool `subagent_type` case/separator-insensitive matching, plugin folder conflict warnings, 13 bug fixes

## [3.39.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **context-evaluator** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md` Configuration Quality section): New entry for the Packmind OSS tool that evaluates CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md quality using 17 AI evaluators (13 error + 4 suggestion). Includes the zero-install web version at context-evaluator.ai, the Caliber comparison table, and cross-ref to the 2 patterns extracted from its source.

- **Runtime Prompt Logging** (`guide/core/skill-design-patterns.md`): New pattern: write the full evaluator prompt to disk as a blocking `await` BEFORE invoking the AI provider. Survives provider crashes, never throws, always-on (not gated by a debug flag). Observed in PackmindHub/context-evaluator (MIT).

- **Adaptive Unified/Parallel Mode** (`guide/core/skill-design-patterns.md`): New pattern: estimate combined token count of input files before launching agents. Below 100K tokens, one unified agent handles all files (cross-file contradiction detection). Above threshold, each file gets an independent parallel agent. Concrete threshold decision with `canUseUnifiedMode()`. Observed in PackmindHub/context-evaluator (MIT).

- **context-evaluator evaluation** (`docs/resource-evaluations/context-evaluator-evaluation.md`): Score 4/5. Documents all 4 patterns identified in the source read, integration decisions, and delta vs Caliber.

- **Credits: context-evaluator** (`guide/core/credits.md`): New entry for PackmindHub/context-evaluator (MIT). Covers Pattern 7 (Runtime Prompt Logging) and Pattern 8 (Adaptive Unified/Parallel Mode).

## [3.39.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Skeptical Reviewer Pattern** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §9.20 Agent Teams): New subsection documenting the four-agent pipeline design where a dedicated "skeptical reviewer" sub-agent filters false positives from parallel audit agents. Includes false-positive criteria, evidence requirement rule, KEEP/REJECT log pattern, and connection to Swarm Mode. Inspired by the Packmind playbook-audit open-source skill (Apache 2.0, Cédric Teyton).

- **MCP Reference File Pattern** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`): New section "Documenting an MCP for Claude: The Reference File Pattern" explaining how a `references/<mcp-name>.md` file injected before any MCP call reduces query failures from syntax gotchas, non-obvious parameter semantics, and rate limit behavior. Includes the three content types, file structure, and link to the fork-ready template.

- **`examples/skills/mcp-integration-reference/SKILL.md`**: Fork-ready template skill demonstrating the MCP reference file pattern. Five-step structure: read reference file, gather scope, fetch data, group and analyze, generate report. Designed to be adapted for any MCP server (Sentry, Datadog, PagerDuty, Linear, etc.).

- **`examples/skills/mcp-integration-reference/references/sentry-mcp.md`**: Complete Sentry MCP reference file template. Covers available tools with full parameter semantics, DDSQL-equivalent query syntax gotchas, pagination approach, known noise exclusion patterns, and five working query examples. Serves as the canonical example of what a good MCP reference file looks like.

- **`guide/core/credits.md`**: New file centralizing attributions for patterns borrowed from open-source engineering work. Current entries: Packmind (6 patterns, Apache 2.0, Cédric Teyton) and Anthropic skill-creator. Linked from README and cited inline at each pattern section.

- **`guide/core/skill-design-patterns.md`**: New reference file covering 6 architectural patterns for multi-agent and multi-file skills: Shared Ground Truth Injection, Pre-filtered References via Frontmatter Paths, Detection-Only Scope Boundary, Input-Handler Dispatch, Versioned Sub-directories for Tool-Version Coupling, and Two-Tier Standards. Each pattern includes the problem it solves, the pattern structure, token trade-offs, and when to apply it. Linked from README.

- **Handoff Triad Pattern** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §2 Session Handoff Pattern): New subsection after the existing handoff template documenting the three-command protocol (`create`, `resume`, `update`) with per-section merge rules. Key addition: append-only Work Done log creates an auditable history across sessions. Includes the merge rules table and link to fork-ready templates.

- **`examples/commands/handoff/create-handoff.md`**: Fork-ready template for session handoff creation. Generates `claudedocs/handoffs/handoff_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` with 8 structured sections. Includes explicit rules: append-only Work Done, `path:line` format for file references, 600-word target for quick loading.

- **`examples/commands/handoff/resume-handoff.md`**: Fork-ready template for loading a handoff document. Parses all sections, summarizes understanding in 3-5 bullets, and requires explicit user confirmation before starting work.

- **`examples/commands/handoff/update-handoff.md`**: Fork-ready template implementing the full merge rules table (keep/append/replace per section). Includes the fallback to new-file creation when no existing handoff is found, and per-step confirmation output.

- **Recipe Template: Context Validation Checkpoints** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §6.3 Command Template): New subsection after the existing command template documenting the checkpoint pattern: a checklist of preconditions Claude must verify before executing recipe steps. Prevents mid-step failures in one-way operations.

- **`examples/commands/recipe-template.md`**: Fork-ready template demonstrating the Context Validation Checkpoints pattern. Includes the checkpoints section, numbered recipe steps with per-step validation, error handling table, and adaptation notes.

- **Plans and Specs as Committed Artifacts** (`guide/core/skill-design-patterns.md`): New section (M4 pattern) documenting the practice of committing plan/spec pairs under `.claude/` as dated markdown files (`YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` + `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-design.md`). Covers why it beats session-only plans (grep-able, resume-able, captures rationale), when to use it, and the naming convention. Inspired by the Packmind `.claude/plans/` convention (Apache 2.0).

- **`examples/scripts/statusline.py`**: Fork-ready context bar script for Claude Code's `statusCommand` setting. Displays a color-coded progress bar (green/yellow/red), context percentage, git branch, and model name. Key insight documented with inline comments: subtracts 32,000 tokens from the total context window to compute the effective input window (output buffer reservation). Adapted from Packmind's `.claude/statusline.py` (Apache 2.0).

- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml`**: Added 20+ entries for all Packmind pattern integrations: `skill_design_patterns_*` (7 patterns), `mcp_reference_file_*`, `skeptical_reviewer_*`, `handoff_triad_*`, `recipe_template_*`, `statusline_*`, and `credits_guide`.

### Changed

- **`tools/audit-prompt.md` v5.0 — orchestrator architecture** (`tools/audit-prompt.md`): Rewrote from a flat 130+ checkbox checklist into an 8-dimension weighted orchestrator (100 pts). The prompt now delegates each domain to a specialized skill or command if installed (eval-skills, eval-rules, token-audit, audit-agents-skills, security-check), with inline bash fallback when not available. New dimensions: Memory & Context (20 pts, delegates to `/token-audit`), Rules Hygiene (10 pts, delegates to `/eval-rules`), Skills Quality (10 pts, delegates to `/eval-skills`), Agents/Commands Quality (10 pts, delegates to `/audit-agents-skills`), Security Posture (20 pts, delegates to `/security-check`), MCP Ecosystem (10 pts), Workflow Commands (10 pts), Freshness & Best Practices (10 pts). Phase 1 replaces 3 separate bash blocks with one unified inventory scan. Phase 3 produces an 8-row scorecard instead of a flat findings table. Added `--include-global` scope flag, "Deepen Your Audit" section with install commands for all delegated skills, and 10 new glossary terms (Context Budget, Rules auto-loaded, paths: frontmatter, effort: field, argument-hint, Hook Profiles, Threat Database, Cache Bug #40524, managed-settings.d/, Routines). Version updated from 4.0 (guide v3.37.6) to 5.0 (guide v3.38.17+).

### Fixed

- **Architecture.md broken image** (`guide/core/architecture.md`): Replaced missing `./images/claude-code-architecture-overview.jpeg` (file never committed) with a Mermaid flowchart showing Claude Code as an orchestration layer over Claude models and the development environment. Attribution to Mohamed Ali Ben Salem preserved as a text link. Fixes [#25](https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/claude-code-ultimate-guide/issues/25).

## [3.38.17] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Context engineering: Structural Metadata Files** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md`): New subsection in Section 4 documenting the pattern of separating rules context (CLAUDE.md) from structural context (code-map.yaml). Covers the two-type distinction, five standard sections, pointer registration table, auto-generation approach, and a production example from a ~1,300-file TypeScript codebase (Méthode Aristote).

- **`examples/context-engineering/code-map-template.yaml`**: Generic starter template for structural metadata files — small auto-generated YAML (~1K tokens) capturing codebase shape: architecture layers with file counts, component domains, nested CLAUDE.md inventory, project stats, key paths. Separate from rules/config context.

- **`examples/context-engineering/context-bench.sh`**: Benchmark script measuring impact of structural metadata files. `--budget` compares token cost across three loading strategies (no code-map / always-on / on-demand). `--probe` tests what % of structural questions are answerable from code-map.yaml without filesystem traversal. `--compare` diffs two code-map versions over time.

- **`examples/skills/eval-rules/SKILL.md`**: Skill for rules-focused audit — resolves `paths:` globs against real project files, flags dead or over-broad patterns, interactive rule-by-rule review with in-place edit support.

- **`examples/commands/routines-discover.md`**: Slash command `/routines-discover` surfacing actionable Routine candidates. Audits five angles (scheduled maintenance, event-driven reactions, alert response, cross-system sync, release automation), outputs ranked use case cards with trigger type, input/output, value estimate, and blockers sorted by value-to-effort ratio.

- **Security hardening** (`.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/`): Applied the guide's own recommendations to this repo. Added `permissions.deny` blocking `.env*`, `*.pem`, `credentials*`, `id_rsa*`, `id_ed25519*`, `secrets/**`. Added `PreToolUse` hook wiring `dangerous-actions-blocker.sh` for Bash, Edit, Write.

- **`examples/commands/scaffold.md`**: Coaching command that asks 4-5 targeted questions to determine whether a use case calls for agent, command, skill, hook, or rule — generates a ready-to-use template for the chosen component type.

- **`scripts/update-cc-releases.sh`**: Extended release tracking to three sources. Added Source 2 (weekly docs digest `code.claude.com/docs/en/whats-new/YYYY-wN.md`) for Desktop/Web/Cloud features not in the GitHub CHANGELOG. Added Source 3 (reference links to Help Center and GitHub releases).

### Changed

- **`examples/context-engineering/ci-drift-check.yml`**: Extended CI trigger section with commented code-level path triggers (`prisma/schema.prisma`, API router dirs) and note on `DRIFT_WARN_ONLY` for gradual gate introduction.

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`**: Added `/eval-rules` to audit tools callout (three tools: `audit-agents-skills`, `eval-skills`, `eval-rules`).

- **`CLAUDE.md` split into `@docs` references**: Reduced from 618 lines to 274 lines (-56%). Extracted four reference sections into `docs/` files loaded on demand via `@refs`.

### Documentation

- **Context management** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Added "bad compact" antipattern callout and updated context rot threshold for 1M context window (Anthropic internal data: 300-400K tokens, task-dependent).

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.110 — `/tui` command, Push notification tool, `--resume/--continue` for scheduled tasks, `/focus` command, `autoScrollEnabled` config, 30+ bug fixes.

- **Routines (Cloud Automation)** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §6.1): Documented April 14, 2026 Routines launch. API trigger (dedicated HTTP POST endpoint, bearer token, returns `session_url`), GitHub event trigger (17 event types, PR filters, requires Claude GitHub App), per-plan daily run limits (Pro 5/day, Max 15/day, Team/Enterprise 25/day).

- **`guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md` §15**: Project Glasswing & Claude Mythos Preview — defensive security initiative with 11 launch partners, automated vulnerability discovery, thousands of high-severity CVEs found in OpenBSD/FFmpeg/Linux kernel.

- **Threat Database v2.13.0**: 6 new CVEs, 2 new attack techniques (T023 Lies-in-the-Loop, T024 Prompt Poaching), 2 new scanning tools (ClawArmor, ClawSec), 2 new research papers.

Covers three built-in modes (Default, Explanatory, Learning), activation via `/config` or `outputStyle` in `settings.json`, custom styles via `.claude/styles/`, token cost impact, and the deprecation history of `/output-style` (Oct 2025). Added `outputStyle` setting expansion in settings-reference, corrected stale `/output-style` slash command row, added entry to `reference.yaml`, added to cheatsheet "Features Méconnues" table, and created `examples/styles/custom-style-template.md` with usage notes and `keep-coding-instructions` myth correction.

## [3.38.10] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Claude Managed Agents section** (`guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md`): New §14 covering Anthropic's cloud-hosted agent platform launched April 8, 2026. Includes: three-way decision table (Messages API vs Managed Agents vs Claude Code), architecture diagram (Brain/Hands/Memory decoupling via Mermaid), multi-agent coordination diagram (orchestrator + specialist threads), real-world use cases (Notion, Rakuten, Asana, Sentry), full Next.js integration pattern (API route with SSE streaming + React hook), decision checklist (when to reach for each layer), research preview features (outcomes/self-evaluation, memory, multi-agent), cost model with per-model pricing table and optimization patterns, `ant` CLI reference, SDK support matrix (8 languages), engineering background (pets vs cattle, assumption decay, interface stability). ToC updated.

## [3.38.9] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **codesight entry** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): New "Project Context Bootstrapping" section covering codesight — a zero-dependency CLI that compiles structured codebase context (routes, schema, deps, blast radius) via AST analysis and exposes it as a wiki knowledge base or 11 MCP tools. Includes command reference, MCP configuration, wiki token comparison table, CI integration snippet, and explicit caveats (self-reported benchmarks, TypeScript-only AST, `--init` CLAUDE.md overwrite risk). Score 3/5 — category gap documented, tool maturity to be reassessed at 90 days. TOC and description frontmatter updated.

## [3.38.8] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Ultraplan documentation** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`, `machine-readable/reference.yaml`): Full coverage of the Ultraplan feature (research preview, v2.1.91+). New `### Ultraplan` subsection in Section 2.3 Plan Mode covering: concept (async cloud planning via multi-agent Opus 4.6), 3 activation methods (`/ultraplan`, keyword, local plan handoff), terminal status indicators, browser review interface (inline comments, emoji reactions, outline sidebar), dual execution paths (cloud → PR, teleport → terminal), requirements (GitHub only, not Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry, incompatible with Remote Control), and comparison table vs Plan Mode vs OpusPlan. Also added cross-reference in Section 9.16 Session Teleportation, and `/ultraplan` command in the cheatsheet quick commands table and Plan Mode section.

- **`git-ai-archaeology` skill** (`examples/skills/git-ai-archaeology/`): New skill that analyzes AI config evolution in any git repository. Reconstructs the chronology of AI adoption by reading git history — first commits per `.claude/` path, monthly commit distribution with ASCII charts, major PRs by category (MCP integrations, skills/hooks/agents, code review automation), optional CHANGELOG AI mentions, and maturity phases synthesis. Read-only, produces a single markdown report. Ported from `boldguy` repo.

## [3.38.7] - 2026-04-08

### Documentation

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.96** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): Added v2.1.94 (Bedrock Mantle support, high effort default for API/enterprise users, plugin skill stable naming, Slack MCP compact header) and v2.1.96 (hotfix for Bedrock auth regression with AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK).

## [3.38.6] - 2026-04-06

### Documentation

- **1M context beta retirement deadline added** (`guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): New row in the API Ecosystem breaking changes table — `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header retired April 30, 2026 for Sonnet 4.5/4. Requests exceeding 200K tokens will error after that date; migrate to Sonnet 4.6 or Opus 4.6.

- **`/powerup` added to Essential Commands** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): The interactive animated lessons command (v2.1.90) was absent from the main guide's Essential Commands bash block. Added after `/help` as both are discovery-oriented entry points.

- **`showThinkingSummaries` note added** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Documented that thinking summaries are off by default in interactive sessions since v2.1.89, with the opt-in path (`"showThinkingSummaries": true` in settings.json). Added near the `cleanupPeriodDays` settings reference.

- **French translation pipeline documented** (`CLAUDE.md`): Added "French Guide Translation + Export" section covering `scripts/translate-guide.py` (Claude Haiku batch translation), `guide/ultimate-guide.fr.md` output, and related workflow.

### Added

- **Threat database update v2.12.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`): 4 new CVEs (CVE-2026-5058 aws-mcp-server 0-day CVSS 9.8, CVE-2026-31951 LibreChat OAuth exfiltration, CVE-2026-34742 Go MCP SDK DNS rebinding, CVE-2026-5323 a11y-mcp SSRF), 1 new attack technique (T022 NomShub IDE remote tunnel persistence via indirect prompt injection in Cursor), 2 new scanning tools (SandyClaw dynamic sandbox + Semgrep MCP integration), 1 new defensive resource (arXiv 2604.03070 empirical study: 1,708 issues found across agent skill ecosystem), 9 new sources, 2 new minimum safe version entries (go-mcp-sdk 1.4.0, a11y-mcp 1.0.6).

- **`/token-audit` skill** (`examples/skills/token-audit/`, also installed in `~/.claude/skills/`): Runnable skill that executes the full token audit — measures fixed-context overhead per component, classifies rules files (ALWAYS/SOMETIMES/RARELY), audits hook stdout per invocation, and produces a prioritized action plan with savings estimates. Includes RAG break-even assessment.

- **Token Audit Workflow** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md` §10): New section with step-by-step workflow to measure and reduce fixed context overhead — shell commands to inventory all loaded components, token budget calculator, signal/noise classification framework (ALWAYS/SOMETIMES/RARELY), hook overhead analysis, action plan template, and a reusable audit prompt. Includes honest RAG assessment (break-even analysis before committing to vector infrastructure).

- **Guide export script**: `scripts/generate-guide-exports.sh` — generates the full `guide/ultimate-guide.md` (~25K lines) as EPUB (488K) and PDF (2.9 MB) via pandoc + Typst. Outputs to `dist/`. Supports `--epub`, `--pdf`, `-o DIR`, `-v` flags. Auto-detects Typst from Quarto's bundled binary. PDF pre-processing strips internal anchor links for Typst compatibility.

### Updated

- **`examples/commands/check-cache-bugs.md`**: Updated to reflect Anthropic's fixes (Bug 1 fixed v2.1.91, Bug 2 fixed v2.1.90) and extended with ArkNill community findings (B4 microcompact silent context stripping, B5 tool result budget cap 200K). Output format now includes version-conditional FIXED status. Bug 3 (attribution header) still active — workaround unchanged.

## [3.38.4] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- **`guide/diagrams/04-architecture-internals.md` — Master Loop rendering bug**: Two backward edges (`G --> C` and `J --> A`) were creating giant black arrow artifacts in Mermaid renderers (dagre layout engine routes long cycle-breaking edges around the entire diagram). Fixed by enclosing the inner tool-execution loop inside a `subgraph AGENT_LOOP` so `F --> C` renders as a contained cycle within the box. Outer conversation loop now routes `J -->|Yes| B` (rebuild prompt) instead of `J -->|Yes| A`, which is also semantically more accurate. Removed the separate "Parse tool calls" node by merging into "Execute tools in parallel" (reflects `StreamingToolExecutor` reality). Description updated to explicitly name the two nested loops.

- **`guide/diagrams/04-architecture-internals.md` — System Prompt Assembly**: Updated to reflect two-zone architecture confirmed by source analysis. Diagram now shows the `BOUNDARY MARKER` separating STATIC zone (`cacheScope: 'global'`, shared across all users) from DYNAMIC zone (per-session cache). Added note that MCP instructions are always recomputed and uncached (confirmed in source: "servers connect/disconnect between turns"). Added `machine-readable` source footnote with 2026-03-31 confirmation date.

## [3.38.3] - 2026-04-03

### Documentation

- **New page `guide/ops/team-metrics.md`** (~400 lines): Complete framework for measuring and piloting AI-augmented tech teams. Covers DORA (4 metrics with 2024 benchmarks + 2025 archetype shift), SPACE framework, AI-specific metrics (contribution metrics, AI PR review quality), product metrics (time-to-value, feature adoption, Bug Escape Rate), recommendations by team size (5-person vs 25-person), vanity metrics to drop, the 4-question decision test, and tooling guide (LinearB, Faros.ai, GitHub Analytics, Axify).
- **`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md` extended**: Added "Team-Level Steering Metrics" subsection in the "For Tech Leads & Engineering Managers" section — Level 1 (DORA delivery health), Level 2 (AI adoption quality), the Velocity Trap warning, and a Monday ritual (3 numbers, 5 minutes).
- **`guide/README.md` updated**: New entry for `ops/team-metrics.md` in the Operations section.
- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.91 — MCP tool result size override via `_meta` annotation (up to 500K), `disableSkillShellExecution` setting, plugin `bin/` executable support, Edit tool shorter `old_string` anchors.

- **`guide/core/context-engineering.md` expanded with 8 new sections** (+198 lines): Added "Context Engineering vs. Context Optimization" (synthesis/reasoning separation, engineering vs. optimization distinction); "Why Context Rot is Structural, Not Accidental" (n² attention architecture, JIT retrieval vs. RAG pre-loading, Memory tool beta, CoT caveat for long agentic tasks); "The Goldilocks problem: altitude" in Project Configuration (productive altitude between too vague and too granular, with worked examples); "Community skill libraries" in Skills vs. Rules (anthropics/claude-code-skills, ibelick/ui-skills); MCP tool count limits in Progressive Disclosure (<10 servers, <80 total tools); "Context Chaining" pattern in Context Lifecycle (curated session-to-session summaries, distinct from Ralph Loop); "Context Drift Detection" in Quality Measurement (cosine distance, share of drifted features, MMD, thresholds table, when to use); PRP methodology cross-reference added to Cross-References.

- **`argument-hint` frontmatter field documented**: Added `argument-hint` to the skill frontmatter table (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` line ~7336), the Variable Interpolation section (new tip + example showing the picker UX), and the Command Template 6.3 (frontmatter block). Also updated `guide/cheatsheet.md` (command minimal example), `whitepapers/recap-cards/fr/m09-slash-commands.qmd` (`$ARGUMENTS` section), `whitepapers/recap-cards/fr/m10-skills.qmd` (frontmatter table), and Appendix A.2/A.3 templates. The field shows placeholder text in the slash command menu when a command/skill accepts `$ARGUMENTS`.

### Examples

- **`argument-hint` added to 29 command templates**: All `examples/commands/` files that use `$ARGUMENTS` but were missing `argument-hint` have been patched (28 root commands + 3 learn/ commands). Hints reflect the actual argument signatures documented in each command body. Only `audit-agents-skills.md` already had the field.

## [3.38.2] - 2026-04-02

### Documentation

- **`/powerup` documented across learning surfaces**: Added `/powerup` (interactive animated lessons, v2.1.90) to `guide/cheatsheet.md` (Essential Commands table), `guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md` (new "Start Here" subsection), `whitepapers/fr/09-apprendre-avec-ia.qmd` (Slash Commands pour l'Apprentissage), `whitepapers/en/09-learning-with-ai.qmd` (Slash Commands for Learning), `whitepapers/recap-cards/fr/01-commandes-essentielles.qmd` (Commandes Slash Core), and `landing/src/content/docs/guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md` (Slash Commands for Learning).
- **Hook events expanded to complete 27-event list**: The Event Types table previously listed 22 events. Added the 5 missing events (`Setup`, `PostCompact`, `InstructionsLoaded`, `Elicitation`, `ElicitationResult`) and restructured all 27 events into 7 logical groups (Lifecycle, Agent actions, Permissions, Compaction, Multi-agent, Configuration, File system, User interaction) for easier scanning.
- **Session-scoped hooks documented**: Added new "Session-Scoped Hooks" subsection explaining that hooks can be registered ephemerally at runtime without writing to `settings.json`. Clarifies that this is the mechanism skills use to register temporary callbacks during their invocation.
- **`bypassPermissions` safety invariant documented**: Added a protection table listing the paths and files Claude Code always prompts before modifying even in `bypassPermissions` mode (`.git/`, `.claude/`, shell configs, `.gitconfig`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude.json`). Also clarified that content-specific `allow` rules survive `bypassPermissions`.
- **MEMORY.md file limits documented**: Added concrete enforcement limits to the Auto-Memories section (200-line cap, 25 KB max per file, 200-file directory cap) with a table explaining truncation behavior and the warning appended when limits are exceeded.

### Maintenance

- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml` synced**: Updated `updated` date to 2026-04-02, expanded `hook_events` from 4 to 27 complete events organized in 8 groups, added `hooks_session_scoped` pointer (line 9507), `permissions.bypass_safety_invariant` pointer (line 1076) with protected paths list, and `auto_memories_file_limits` pointer (line 5020) with limit detail string.
- **README.md stats updated**: Templates count 225 → 228, guide lines 22K+/23K+ → 24K+ (24,734 lines), date badge synced to Apr 2, 2026.

### Fixed

- **Hooks documentation gaps (fact-checked vs official docs)**: Added missing `defer` value to `permissionDecision` options, added multi-hook precedence rule (`deny > defer > ask > allow`, v2.1.89+), clarified that exit code 2 silently discards stdout/JSON (only stderr is forwarded to Claude), and added a dedicated `defer` semantics block explaining its headless-only usage with `stop_reason: "tool_deferred"` and `--resume`.

## [3.38.1] - 2026-04-02

### Documentation

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.90
  - /powerup command — interactive animated lessons with live demos
  - Fixed session-crashing infinite loop in rate-limit dialog
  - Fixed --resume prompt-cache miss regression (since v2.1.69)
  - PowerShell tool hardened: trailing & bypass, debugger hang, TOCTOU
  - SSE transport linear-time for large frames; per-turn JSON.stringify eliminated

### Changed

- **BMAD selection criterion corrected**: Replaced "Enterprise 10+ teams" with "High-complexity projects with stable requirements" across all docs. The real driver is project complexity + requirement stability, not headcount. BMAD is usable solo or at any team size — and becomes a liability when specs change mid-project. Updated `guide/core/methodologies.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `whitepapers/fr/07-guide-reference.qmd`, `whitepapers/en/07-reference-guide.qmd`, `landing/src/pages/methodologies/index.astro`, `landing/src/data/methodology-quiz.ts`. Added explicit "when to avoid: evolving requirements" warning throughout.

- **FDD selection criterion corrected**: Replaced "Large teams 10+" with "Feature teams, parallel delivery" — FDD is organized around feature ownership and parallel delivery structure, not raw headcount. Updated same files.

### Added

- **`/methodology-advisor` command**: New slash command that reads the codebase silently (contributors, test maturity, spec files, LLM signals, file count) and asks only 3 targeted questions to recommend one of 8 methodology stacks — with contextual quick start using real project paths. Available in `examples/commands/methodology-advisor.md`.

- **Methodology Quiz (landing)**: New `/methodologies/` page on `cc.bruniaux.com`. Interactive 12-question quiz recommends one of 8 methodology stacks based on team size, project stage, session style, test maturity, and more. Full decision matrix with Combination Patterns table, two-axis map, and 8 stack cards with quick-start prompts. Linked from home page Methodologies section, header nav, footer, and sitemap.

- **Methodology Map**: Added 2D positioning diagram to `guide/core/methodologies.md` (between Decision Tree and The 15 Methodologies sections). Maps all 20 methodologies on Spec-First/Code-First (Y) vs Lean/Enterprise (X) axes, with quadrant labels and reading guide. Synced to landing guide reader.

- **WP09 update (v3.27.6 → v3.38.1)**: Updated both FR (`09-apprendre-avec-ia.qmd`) and EN (`09-learning-with-ai.qmd`) whitepapers to integrate v3.37.0–v3.38.1 changes: (1) Agent Adoption Curve — 7-level maturity scale from Nicolas Martignole/Back Market, inserted as new "Où en Êtes-Vous?" section after the Three Patterns diagnosis; (2) "Job is now the spec" reframing (Larridin/Kanitkar) — developer as producer/director, mastery = spec-writing quality, added in Augmented Pattern section; (3) JiT Tests as comprehension exercise — Meta production results (4x hardening tests, 70% review load reduction), brief mention in Augmented Pattern advanced techniques. Added 2 new source entries in Practitioners table.

- **WP01 update (v3.27.6 → v3.38.1)**: Updated both FR (`01-prompts-efficaces.qmd`) and EN (`01-effective-prompts.qmd`) whitepapers to integrate v3.37.0–v3.38.1 changes: new slash commands (`/investigate`, `/qa`, `/canary`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/review-pr` enhanced, `/session-save`), `/loop` and `/branch` workflow tools, `effort` frontmatter field for skills/commands, and `showThinkingSummaries: false` default note in Thinking Modes section. Added "New Workflows v3.37+" section in both files.

- **WP02 update (v3.27.6 → v3.38.1)**: Updated both FR (`02-personnalisation.qmd`) and EN (`02-customization.qmd`): Agent Memory 3-scope table (user/project/local), `effort` field in Skills frontmatter, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` persistent storage section, `managed-settings.d/` enterprise governance section.

- **WP03 update (v3.27.6 → v3.38.1)**: Updated both FR (`03-securite.qmd`) and EN (`03-security.qmd`): v2.1.78 security fixes (silent sandbox disable, MCP deny bypass, protected dirs writable in bypassPermissions), Hook Profiles env-based gating (minimal/standard/strict), conditional `if` field for hooks, PermissionDenied hook event, heartbeat dead-man switch with timeout table, threat intelligence update (T021 IDEsaster, GhostClaw, CVE-2026-33010, CVE-2026-27825/27826, Cisco DefenseClaw, Ferrok).

- **WP04 update (v3.27.6 → v3.38.1)**: Updated both FR and EN `04-architecture.qmd`: auto-compact precise mechanism (6-7% buffer + micro-compaction), streaming tool execution (10 parallel), Advanced Tool Use Patterns table (PTC/Dynamic Filtering/Tool Use Examples), Agent Memory 3 scopes, knowledge cutoffs table (Sonnet 4.6/Opus 4.6/Haiku 4.5).

- **`/audit-whitepapers` command**: New diagnostic command that audits all whitepapers (FR + EN) and recap cards (FR + EN) for version freshness, FR/EN parity, and metadata quality. Scores each document out of 100 across 4 phases (version gap 40pts, content staleness 20pts, parity 20pts, metadata 20pts) with A-F grading. Supports `--fix` (frontmatter patch suggestions), `--verbose` (all criteria), `--wp-only`, `--cards-only`. Feeds into `/update-whitepapers` for systematic updates.

### Fixed

- **Cache bugs audit — Bug 2 root cause corrected** (2026-04-01): JSONL writer strips DTD records before write (not position mismatch on restore); severity upgraded HIGH with concrete session data (87-118K tokens/resume, 300-400K/session at 3-4 resumes). Engineering fix redirected to the writer. Updated in `check-cache-bugs.md`, `known-issues.md`, `claudedocs/cache-bugs-audit-2026-03-31.md`.
- **ultimate-guide.md — prompt caching section**: Added "Known cache bugs (v2.1.69+)" callout with workarounds for Bug 2 (avoid --resume) and Bug 3 (CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER=false), link to known-issues.md and /check-cache-bugs.
- **check-cache-bugs command**: Added missing YAML frontmatter (`name` + `description` fields) — command was not recognized by Claude Code slash command system (reported by genesiscz in CC#40524)
- **check-cache-bugs + known-issues: Bug 2 mechanism corrected** (per fivedollarfridays CC#40524): root cause is session JSONL writer stripping `deferred_tools_delta` records before write, not position mismatch on restore. On --resume, full DTD re-announcement shifts all message positions → 0% cache ratio on every resume. Concrete evidence: 87-118K tokens rebuilt per resume, 300-400K/session with 3-4 resumes. Severity upgraded from MEDIUM to HIGH.
- **known-issues + check-cache-bugs: Bug 3 severity recalibrated** (per jmarianski, original RE analyst): "marginal impact" on session tokens in practice — system prompt is small relative to total context. Bug 2 has larger measurable cost for heavy users.
- **check-cache-bugs background section**: Corrected cost impact estimate from "10-20x" to "2-5x on input tokens" (early community estimates conflated system prompt portion with total session cost); added source-verified mechanism details for all three bugs
- **known-issues.md**: Added Section 0 documenting prompt cache bugs (CC#40524) with per-bug root cause, workaround, concrete JSONL data for Bug 2, and link to /check-cache-bugs audit command

### Documentation

- **Source analysis corrections (2026-03-31)**: Applied 4 targeted corrections to the guide based on source-level analysis, each verifiable by observable behavior
  - **Knowledge cutoffs**: Added model knowledge cutoff table (Sonnet 4.6 = Aug 2025, Opus 4.6 = May 2025, Haiku 4.5 = Feb 2025) to the Model Aliases section
  - **Auto-compact precision**: Replaced the inconsistent "~80%" description with the accurate mechanism (triggers when remaining context drops below a fixed buffer, ~6-7% of window); reconciled conflicting "75% vs 80%" mentions in the guide
  - **Micro-compaction**: Added description of the lightweight pre-compaction pass that selectively compresses older tool results before full auto-compact runs
  - **Streaming tool execution**: Added note explaining that concurrency-safe tools (Read, Grep, Glob) can start executing while the model is still generating, and run in parallel (up to 10 concurrent)
  - **Internal reference**: Created `claudedocs/source-code-analysis-2026-03-31.md` (gitignored) with full findings from 6-agent source analysis covering 512K lines — serves as future documentation reference when features ship officially

- **CC release v2.1.89**: Updated Claude Code releases tracking to v2.1.89 (previous session incorrectly labeled this v2.1.88; v2.1.88 does not appear in release notes)
  - `"defer"` permission decision for `PreToolUse` hooks — headless pause + `-p --resume` re-evaluation
  - PermissionDenied hook for auto mode classifier denials (return `{retry: true}` to retry)
  - `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1` env var for flicker-free alt-screen rendering
  - Named subagents in `@` mention typeahead; `MCP_CONNECTION_NONBLOCKING=true` for `-p` mode
  - **Breaking**: Thinking summaries now off by default (`showThinkingSummaries: true` to restore)
  - Massive bugfix batch: CRLF on Windows, StructuredOutput cache (50% failure rate), memory leaks, crashes, voice mode, autocompact thrash circuit breaker

### Meta

- **Stats sync**: Updated guide stats across all LLM-indexing files — 24,600+ lines (was 24,200+), 226 templates (was 217); `reference.yaml` date updated to 2026-03-30

### Added
- `docs/resource-evaluations/community-signals-benchmark-march-2026.md`: evaluation of two synthesized FR-language reports on Claude Code community signals and competitor benchmark for March 2026 (score 3/5). Two factual errors detected: "Auto Mode" as a permission mode (does not exist) and Channels attributed to Claude Code (they are ClawdBot). All other identified gaps were already covered.
- `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §1.4: added Permission Fatigue anti-pattern section with decision table (right mode per situation). Community signals confirm this is a top friction point: users approve prompts without reading then reach for `--dangerously-skip-permissions` on non-sandboxed machines.

### Fixed
- `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §Subscription Plans: removed expired Spring Break promotion note (ran March 13-27, 2026).

- `guide/workflows/agent-teams.md` §8 Best Practices: added AGENTS.md for Compound Learning section covering what to document, the empirical case for human-curated vs LLM-generated files (Gloaguen et al., 2026: -3% success / +20% cost for LLM-generated, +4% for developer-written), and maintenance rules. Added Loop Guardrails section (MAX_ITERATIONS=8, mandatory reflection prompt, kill/reassign criteria). Added Dedicated Reviewer Teammate section (Opus 4.6, read-only, auto-trigger on TaskCompleted, 1:4 ratio). Added token budgeting per agent to Cost Optimization (hard limits, 85% pause threshold). Credit: Addy Osmani — O'Reilly AI CodeCon, March 2026.
- `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §11 CLAUDE.md size guidelines: extended Gloaguen et al. citation to include task success rate data (-3% for LLM-generated, +4% for developer-written) previously missing from the cost-only note at line 16924.
- `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §Fresh Context Pattern (Ralph Loop): added disambiguation note clarifying two distinct community usages — Geoffrey Huntley's original context rotation pattern vs the multi-agent atomic task iteration variant popularized in 2026.
- `docs/resource-evaluations/080-addy-osmani-code-agent-orchestra.md`: evaluation of Addy Osmani's O'Reilly AI CodeCon article on multi-agent orchestration (score 3/5, 5 integration items identified).
- `guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md` §13 Autonomous Research Loops: documents the autoresearch pattern from [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) (57K stars, March 2026). Covers the core loop (measure → change → re-measure → keep/revert), the `program.md` behavior contract, ML-to-code-quality adaptation table, safety properties via git rollback, and when to use/avoid the pattern.
- `examples/commands/autoresearch.md`: new command template implementing the autoresearch loop for code quality. Four modes: scan (propose loops), scaffold (generate measure.sh + direction.txt + files.txt), run (autonomous iterations), status (all loops overview). Includes `program.md` writing guide and ML vs code quality comparison table.

- `examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`: updated to v2.10.0 (2026-03-27). New entries: CVE-2026-27825 (mcp-atlassian unrestricted file write, chains with CVE-2026-27826 for MCPwnfluence RCE, CVSS 9.1), CVE-2025-59834 (ADB MCP Server command injection, critical). New attack techniques: T019 (Marketplace Ranking Manipulation — ClawHub Convex public mutation exploit reached 3,900 executions across 50+ cities), T020 (Agentic Tool Chain Reasoning Layer Attack — CrowdStrike). New scanning tools: Cisco DefenseClaw (open-source, Skills Scanner + MCP Scanner + a2a-scanner + CodeGuard + AI BoM, 2026-03-27), hackmyagent (community red-team toolkit), ClawNet (Silverfort OpenClaw plugin), ESET AI Skills Checker. New defensive resources: TrueFoundry MCP Gateway, Cisco DefenseClaw. 7 new sources added. Updated CVE-2026-27826 notes with MCPwnfluence chain context.

### Fixed
- Fixed 52 broken links across 22 guide files: all `./ultimate-guide.md#anchor` and `../ultimate-guide.md#anchor` patterns converted to bare `#anchor` format so the landing build script resolves them to the correct split chapter. 20 anchors also corrected (stale section numbers, renamed headings, double-hyphens). Fixed `/en/github-actions` → `./github-actions.md` and `/en/gitlab-ci-cd` → plain text in `workflows/code-review.md`. Fixed malformed link text in `workflows/design-to-code.md`. Files: core/ (architecture, methodologies), ecosystem/ (ai-ecosystem, context-engineering-tools, third-party-tools), ops/ (ai-traceability, devops-sre, observability), roles/ (agent-evaluation, learning-with-ai), security/ (production-safety, security-hardening), workflows/ (agent-teams, code-review, design-to-code, dual-instance-planning, github-actions, search-tools-mastery, skeleton-projects, task-management, team-ai-instructions).

## [3.38.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §7.6 Hook Profiles: environment-variable-based hook gating (minimal/standard/strict) for scaling hooks across teams without one-size-fits-all enforcement. Per-hook level assignment via `HOOK_REQUIRED_LEVEL` env prefix. Credit: Everything Claude Code (Affaan Mustafa).
- `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §9.24 Instinct-Based Continuous Learning: lightweight observation capture at Stop hook (not UserPromptSubmit), confidence scoring, decay model, and promotion pipeline from instincts to CLAUDE.md rules or skills. Credit: Everything Claude Code v2.
- `guide/workflows/agent-teams.md` §9 Iterative Retrieval for Sub-Agents: max-3-cycles retrieval budget for sub-agents lacking context. WHY/WHAT separation pattern for sub-agent task prompts. Credit: Everything Claude Code longform guide.
- `guide/security/production-safety.md` Rule 6 Autonomous Loop Safety: heartbeat dead-man switch with process-group kill (not just parent). PostToolUse heartbeat writer + separate watchdog script. Timeout tuning table by task type. Credit: Everything Claude Code Security Guide.
- `examples/agents/loop-monitor.md`: new agent template for monitoring unattended autonomous sessions. Detects stalls (no activity > threshold), token runaway (high rate vs baseline), and repeated action loops (same call N times). Haiku model, read-only, pairs with watchdog.
- `examples/commands/session-save.md`: new command template for structured session handoff. Captures decisions, modified files, current status, and ordered next steps into a timestamped Markdown file.

## [3.37.8] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- `guide/ultimate-guide.md`: expanded Auto Dream section with full technical depth — server-side feature flag (`tengu_onyx_plover`), exact system prompt quote, Sleep-time Compute academic foundation (Berkeley + Letta), phase 2 grep-not-read strategy, configuration JSON, performance benchmark (913 sessions / 9 min), before/after MEMORY.md line counts, `/dream` bug status (issues #38461/#38426, PR #39299), 3 quality gaps (identity/accuracy/transparency) from issue #38493 with concrete examples, community implementations (dream-skill, ai-dream), guidance on when Auto Dream is redundant vs. useful.

## [3.37.6] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `/investigate` command (`examples/commands/investigate.md`): root-cause debugging. Iron Law enforcement, 5-phase workflow, failure pattern table (6 modes), 3-strike escalation, blast radius gate. Inspired by gstack/investigate.
- `/qa` command (`examples/commands/qa.md`): browser QA testing with diff-aware scoping. 3 tiers, 7-category issue taxonomy × 4 severities, PASS/WARN/FAIL health scores, fix-verify loop. Inspired by gstack/qa.
- `/canary` command (`examples/commands/canary.md`): post-deploy monitoring. Baseline capture, 10-min loop, transient tolerance (2+ checks), 4 alert levels, curl-based platform-agnostic. Inspired by gstack/canary.
- `/land-and-deploy` command (`examples/commands/land-and-deploy.md`): merge-to-verify pipeline. Pre-flight → CI wait → merge → platform detection (Fly/Render/Vercel/Netlify/Heroku/Railway) → canary verify → revert. Inspired by gstack/land-and-deploy.
- `guide/core/settings-reference.md`: complete settings.json and env vars reference (1,284 lines, v2.1.81).

### Changed
- `/review-pr` enhanced: scope drift detection (plan vs diff cross-ref), Fix-First heuristic, LLM Output Trust Boundary review category. Inspired by gstack/review/checklist.md.
- `IDEAS.md`: deferred gstack patterns captured (autoplan, office-hours, freeze/unfreeze, retro, design-review, benchmark).

### Changed

- **update(guide/section-1.6)**: rewrite "Migrating from Other AI Coding Tools" with March 2026 fact-checked data (closes #12). GitHub Copilot: agent mode GA, MCP GA, full codebase context, multi-model selection, updated pricing tiers (Free/$10/$39 Pro+). Cursor: agent mode GA, Background Agents, MCP Apps v2.6. Windsurf: pricing raised to $20 (Cognition AI acquisition), Cascade still core. Zed: Zeta2 autocomplete, subagents, up to 1M token context, MCP with OAuth. Removed all factually false claims ("suggestions only", "current file", "weak debugging") and replaced with honest differentiators (terminal-native, persistent context system, headless/CI mode, agent orchestration). Added pricing comparison table. Fixed cc-copilot-bridge tier naming (Pro+ -> Pro, $10/mo).

### Added

- **`/investigate` command** (`examples/commands/investigate.md`): root-cause debugging command. Enforces the Iron Law (no fixes before root cause). 5-phase workflow: collect symptoms, read code, check recent changes, reproduce, pattern analysis. Includes known pattern table (race conditions, null propagation, state corruption, integration failure, config drift, stale cache), 3-strike escalation rule, blast radius gate (>5 files touched → confirm), and structured DEBUG REPORT output. Inspired by [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) `/investigate`.

- **`/qa` command** (`examples/commands/qa.md`): systematic browser QA testing with diff-aware scoping. 3 tiers (quick/standard/exhaustive). Identifies affected routes from `git diff --name-only` and tests those pages first. Issue taxonomy: 7 categories (visual, functional, UX, content, performance, console, accessibility) × 4 severities (critical/high/medium/low). Fix-then-verify loop with atomic commits per fix. PASS/WARN/FAIL health score per category. Ship readiness verdict. Browser-agnostic. Inspired by gstack `/qa`.

- **`/canary` command** (`examples/commands/canary.md`): post-deploy monitoring. Baseline capture mode (`--baseline`), continuous monitoring loop (default 10 min), 4 alert levels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), transient tolerance (2+ checks before alerting), CANARY REPORT output, baseline update offer after healthy deploy. curl-based, no browser daemon required. Inspired by gstack `/canary`.

- **`/land-and-deploy` command** (`examples/commands/land-and-deploy.md`): complete merge-to-verify pipeline picking up where `/ship` leaves off. Pre-flight → CI wait → pre-merge readiness gate → merge → platform detection (Fly.io, Render, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, Railway) → deploy polling → production health check → deploy report. One critical safety gate before merge; revert always available. Inspired by gstack `/land-and-deploy`.

- **`/review-pr` enhanced** (`examples/commands/review-pr.md`): 3 new sections: (1) **Scope Drift Detection** — searches `~/.claude/plans/` for branch plan file, cross-references stated scope vs actual diff; (2) **Fix-First Heuristic** — AUTO-FIX (dead code, N+1, stale comments, magic numbers) vs ASK (security, race conditions, design decisions); (3) **LLM Output Trust Boundary** in Agent 3 — flags AI-generated values written to DB without validation. Inspired by gstack `/review` + `review/checklist.md`.

- **Settings Reference** (`guide/core/settings-reference.md`, 1,284 lines): new comprehensive reference for all `settings.json` keys and environment variables. Covers 60+ settings organized into 13 sections (Core, Plans/Memory, Permissions, Hooks, MCP, Sandbox, Plugins, Model, Display/UX, Auth, Attribution, Worktrees, AWS/Cloud) plus 100+ environment variables across 13 categories. Cross-references official docs, JSON schema, and community research. Unverified settings marked `⚠️ Unverified`; schema-only keys marked `📋 Schema only`. Includes full permission rule syntax, complete config example, and quick-reference table.

- **CLI Flags Reference expanded** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` ~l.21833): replaced minimal 23-flag flat table (36% coverage) with comprehensive structured reference. 50+ flags across 13 categories (Session & Context, Model, Output, Permissions, System Prompt, Agent, MCP, Workspace, Budget, Integration, Init, Debug, Settings Override), 10 subcommands (`claude auth`, `claude doctor`, `claude mcp`, `claude plugin`, `claude remote-control`, `claude setup-token`, `claude update`, `claude install`, `claude agents`), and startup environment variables table. Short form aliases documented throughout.

- **Agent Memory section** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §4.5, ~113 lines): dedicated section expanding scattered mentions into a cohesive reference. Covers the three memory scopes (`user` / `project` / `local`) with storage paths and selection guide, 200-line injection limit and overflow handling via topic-specific files, recommended MEMORY.md structure, prompting patterns, and comparison table against CLAUDE.md and auto-memory. Sections §4.5-§4.6 renumbered to §4.6-§4.7.

- **Advanced Tool Use Patterns section** (`guide/core/architecture.md` §7, ~125 lines): new section covering four Anthropic API features GA since February 2026. Programmatic Tool Calling (PTC) — multi-tool orchestration in one inference pass; Dynamic Filtering — pre-processing raw HTML before context injection (official benchmarks: +13.3pp BrowseComp for Sonnet 4.6); Tool Use Examples — `input_examples` field lifting tool accuracy from 72% to 90%; Claude Code relevance table (CLI vs Agent SDK). The ~37% PTC token reduction marked as community-reported.

- **Context Engineering Tools page** (`guide/ecosystem/context-engineering-tools.md`): ecosystem map for token/context optimization tools. Covers output compression (RTK, Headroom), prompt compression (LLMLingua), AI gateways (Edgee, Portkey), RAG optimization, KV cache infrastructure (vLLM PagedAttention, SGLang RadixAttention), LLMOps observability (Langfuse, LangSmith, Arize Phoenix, TruLens), and core concepts (MVC, Context Rot, Semantic Priming Hypothesis).

- **Auto Dream section** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` ~l.4945): community-discovered memory consolidation feature. 4-phase process (Orient, Gather Signal, Consolidate, Prune & Index), trigger conditions (24h + 5 sessions), access via `/memory`. Unofficial status caveated.

- **Glossary** (`guide/core/glossary.md`): 130+ alphabetical term definitions — Claude Code-specific concepts, community-coined patterns, AI engineering vocabulary. Includes Config hierarchy (Local > Project > Global), Boris Cherny attribution, Desloppify (@peteromallet), BMAD, Ralph Wiggum Loop (Geoffrey Huntley), 56% Reliability Warning.

### Documentation

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.84 — PowerShell tool for Windows (opt-in preview), `TaskCreated` hook, `WorktreeCreate` hook HTTP support, global system-prompt caching with ToolSearch, `allowedChannelPlugins` managed setting, idle-return prompt after 75+ min, deep links open in preferred terminal, MCP tool descriptions capped at 2KB, bare `#123` no longer auto-linked.

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.83 — `managed-settings.d/` drop-in directory, `CwdChanged`/`FileChanged` hook events, transcript search in Ctrl+O, `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB=1`, fixed `--mcp-config` bypassing managed policy, fixed macOS exit hang, `sandbox.failIfUnavailable`.

### Fixed

- **"Slop" attribution** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): added Simon Willison attribution (2024) before the Desloppify section.
- **Glossary corrections** (`guide/core/glossary.md`): fixed Config hierarchy direction, Boris Cherny title, Desloppify author, BMAD expansion, Ralph Wiggum Loop attribution, auto-compaction threshold values, 4 alphabetical ordering issues.
- **`paths:` array bug in rules frontmatter** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): replaced failing `paths:` YAML array syntax with `globs:` field in both code examples. Added warnings referencing GH#17204.

## [3.37.5] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Veille CC Releases 2.1.77-2.1.81** (score 3/5): Weekly release summary covering 5 releases (March 17-20, 2026). Releases already tracked in claude-code-releases.yaml/md. Audit revealed 5 gaps in thematic sections: `StopFailure` hook added to Event Types table (`ultimate-guide.md`), `rate_limits` statusline field documented with JSON schema (`ultimate-guide.md`), `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` persistent storage documented in Plugin System section (`ultimate-guide.md`), `--bare` mode added to GitHub Actions CI example (`ultimate-guide.md`), `sandbox.filesystem` settings block (allowWrite/denyRead/allowRead) added to `guide/security/sandbox-native.md`.

### Security
- **Threat database updated to v2.9.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`): 1 new malicious author (`sakaen736jih`, 199 automated skills, Bitdefender/Particula), 5 new CVEs (CVE-2026-4192 quip-mcp-server RCE, CVE-2026-4198 mcp-server-auto-commit injection, CVE-2026-33252 MCP Go SDK CSRF, CVE-2026-4270 AWS API MCP path traversal, CVE-2026-27826 MCP Atlassian SSRF), 2 new campaigns (ClickFix OpenClaw, Fake CLI Prerequisites via openclawcli.vercel.app), 2 new IOCs (malicious domains), 1 new scanning tool (AquilaX), 1 new defensive resource (42crunch), 9 new sources. ClawHavoc stats updated (341 → 1,184+ malicious skills by March 1, 2026).

### Fixed
- **`eval-skills` skill — removed non-official `tags` frontmatter criterion**: `tags` is not a supported field in the Claude Code skill spec. The skill was incorrectly scoring it as a quality criterion (1pt) and listing it in the parse step. Removed `tags` from frontmatter, scoring table, and parse instructions. Scoring total adjusted from 15 to 14 pts with updated thresholds (≥80% = ≥11/14, 60-79% = 8-10/14). Added an explicit note warning against using `tags`. Reported by community via Alexandre Aubert.

## [3.37.4] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Harman "Just-in-Time Catching Test Generation at Meta"** (arxiv 2601.22832, score 4/5): JiTTests are ephemeral, LLM-generated tests triggered at PR submission that fail by design to surface regressions. Production-verified at Meta (4x over hardening tests, 70% reduction in human review load). Integrated into `guide/core/methodologies.md` (new JiTTesting subsection) and `guide/workflows/tdd-with-claude.md` (forward link from Mutation Testing).
- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Caliber config quality tool** (score 3/5): CLI tool scoring AI agent config quality 0-100 (61 deterministic checks, local-only). Integrated into `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md` as new "Configuration Quality" section.
- **Resource Evaluation — Larridin "Building AI-Native Engineering Teams"** (Kanitkar, score 4/5): Producer role concept, "job is now the spec" reframing, and two anti-patterns (no parallel implementation subagents; provide full plan text to agents). Integration target: `guide/roles/`.
- **Resource Evaluation — Anthropic weekly watch March 16-23, 2026** (score 3/5): Three gaps identified for integration — `thinking.display: "omitted"` (extended thinking section), model capabilities API fields, `--bare` vs `-p` CI/CD tradeoffs.

### Changed
- **Claude Code releases tracking** updated to v2.1.81 — `--bare` flag for scripted `-p` calls, `--channels` permission relay, worktree auto-resume fix, MCP tool call collapsing.
- **README** — dynamic star history chart added.
- **`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`** — historical arc intro paragraph (browser → IDE+MCP → CLI agents, 2022-26).

- **Resource Evaluation — Anthropic weekly watch March 16-23, 2026** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-23-veille-hebdo-anthropic-16-23-mars.md`): Score 3/5. Perplexity synthesis covering CC 2.1.81, Python SDK v0.85/v0.86, and two Platform API entries. CC releases already tracked. Three actionable gaps identified: (1) `thinking.display: "omitted"` absent from extended thinking section — multi-turn API pattern for chain continuity without full thinking text transmission; (2) model capabilities API fields (`GET /v1/models` now returns `capabilities` object + `max_input_tokens`) absent from guide — enables runtime-dynamic model selection; (3) `--bare` vs standard `-p` tradeoffs missing from CI/CD scripting section. 81k study and Python SDK items out of scope.

- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Caliber (rely-ai-org/caliber)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/caliber-config-quality-tool.md`): Score 3/5. CLI tool that scores AI agent config quality (0-100, deterministic, 61 checks, local-only), generates tailored configs via codebase fingerprinting, and detects drift between code and CLAUDE.md using git-based signals. Early-stage (released March 2026, 65 stars at eval). Full source code audit conducted. Integrated into `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md` as a new "Configuration Quality" section between Configuration Management and Engineering Standards Distribution — a gap not covered by any existing tool in the guide.

- **Guide update: Configuration Quality section in `third-party-tools.md`** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`): New section added for Caliber. Includes full scoring rubric table (6 categories), delta comparison vs AIBlueprint/Packmind, code examples, security note (write access to CLAUDE.md), and cross-refs. ToC updated, Recommendations by Persona updated.

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.81 — `--bare` flag for scripted `-p` calls (skips hooks/LSP/plugins, API key only), `--channels` permission relay (forward tool approvals to phone), worktree session auto-resume fix, MCP read/search collapsing into "Queried {server}" line, plan mode hides "clear context" by default, fixed concurrent sessions re-authenticating on OAuth refresh, fixed Node.js 18 crash

- **Resource Evaluation + Integration — Harman "Just-in-Time Catching Test Generation at Meta" (arxiv 2601.22832)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-22-harman-jittesting-meta-arxiv.md`): Score 4/5. Industrial paper by Mark Harman (Meta), Jan 30 2026. JiTTests are ephemeral, LLM-generated tests triggered at PR submission — they fail by design to surface regressions, then are discarded. Production-verified: 4x improvement over hardening tests, 70% reduction in human review load, 4 serious failures caught out of 41 candidates at Meta's 100M+ LoC codebase. Integrated into `guide/core/methodologies.md` (new JiTTesting subsection after CDD, with practical approximation pattern for Claude Code today) and `guide/workflows/tdd-with-claude.md` (forward link from Mutation Testing advanced pattern).

- **Resource Evaluation — Larridin "Building AI-Native Engineering Teams" (Kanitkar)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/larridin-ai-native-teams-kanitkar.md`): Score 4/5. Practitioner playbook from Ameya Kanitkar (Co-founder & CTO, Larridin), Jan 2026. Key contributions not yet covered in the guide: "job is now the spec" mindset reframing, Producer role concept for AI-native team coordination, team structure advice (small in-office teams, flow management for teammates), and anti-patterns section with two specific operational constraints (never dispatch parallel implementation subagents; never let agent read plan files — provide full text instead). Context engineering, Ralph Wiggum, and Docker sandboxes already documented. Model version specifics (GPT 5.2) flagged as unverifiable. Integration target: `guide/roles/` and adoption section of ultimate guide.

- **README: Star History chart added** (`README.md`): Dynamic star growth chart from star-history.com embedded before the Contributing section. Shows the repo trajectory since January 2026 (0 → 2K+ stars). Renders live on GitHub via the star-history.com SVG API.

- **Resource Evaluation — Arnaud Gaches "MCP vs CLI" (Dev with IA)** (`docs/resource-evaluations/arnaud-gaches-mcp-vs-cli-devwithia.md`): Score 2/5. Community synthesis from the Dev with IA Slack/LinkedIn (1500+ devs). Key contributions: three-phase historical arc (browser 2022-23 → IDE+MCP 2024-25 → CLI agents 2025-26), update on MCP token cost (author claims unused servers now inject 0 tokens), model-size heuristic (frontier models → CLI, small local models → MCP), enterprise case for MCP Remote (centralized updates, observability). Scored 2/5 for lack of verifiable sources and unclear attribution. Applied: historical arc intro added to `guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`.

- **Guide update: historical arc intro in `mcp-vs-cli.md`** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`): Two-sentence context paragraph added at the top explaining the interface evolution (browser → IDE+MCP → CLI agents, 2022-26) that frames why the MCP vs CLI question exists. Sourced from Arnaud Gaches community synthesis evaluation.

## [3.37.3] - 2026-03-20

- **New skill: `eval-skills`** (`examples/skills/eval-skills/SKILL.md`): Skills-only audit tool with integrated effort-level inference engine. Discovers all SKILL.md files + flat skill files in `.claude/skills/`, scores each across 6 criteria (15 pts: name, description quality, allowed-tools scope, effort field, content structure, tags), infers appropriate `effort` level from content signals (mechanical → `low`, bounded analysis → `medium`, adversarial/architectural → `high`), flags mismatches between declared and inferred effort, and outputs a copy-paste ready patch block for missing/wrong effort fields. Portable across projects — drop in `.claude/skills/` and run `/eval-skills`. Guide updated with comparison vs `/audit-agents-skills` in the Validating Skills section.

- **New skill: `smart-explore`** (`examples/skills/smart-explore.md`): Progressive code exploration using tree-sitter AST — structure first, drill second. Three approaches: (A) no-setup discipline with grep-based signature extraction, (B) tree-sitter CLI + lightweight Python script (50-150 tokens per file vs 2,000-5,000 for full reads), (C) MCP server options (mcp-server-tree-sitter for general use, code-review-graph for PR reviews, jCodeMunch for symbol lookup). Inspired by Alex Newman (Claude-MEM) + validated by Aider repo map pattern at 40k+ stars. Honest benchmarks: ~86% token reduction for module exploration, ~90% for feature-finding tasks.

- **Resource Evaluation — Tree-Sitter Progressive Code Exploration** (`docs/resource-evaluations/tree-sitter-progressive-code-exploration.md`): Score 4/5. Ecosystem evaluation of 5 tools implementing the AST-based progressive exploration pattern: jCodeMunch-MCP (~1,200 stars, 10-25% realistic savings, commercial $79+), mcp-server-tree-sitter/wrale (~270 stars, raw AST queries, Feb 2026), code-review-graph (~2,000 stars, 6.8x average for PR reviews, MIT), CodeRLM (192 stars, Claude autonomy problem), Aider repo map (reference implementation, 40k+ stars). Pattern fills genuine gap in guide (command savings via RTK are documented; code reading savings were not). Primary recommendation: code-review-graph for teams doing PR reviews (MIT, marketplace), mcp-server-tree-sitter for raw AST access, Approach B (script, no MCP) for solo workflows.

- **New guide section: Progressive Code Exploration (Smart Explore)** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): 110-line section added near the RTK token efficiency section. Explains the structure-first → target → cross-reference pattern with worked examples, CLAUDE.md snippet, and comparison table (RTK vs smart-explore vs grepai). Honest benchmarks: 86-92% token reduction for module exploration. Three approaches: no-setup grep discipline, tree-sitter CLI + Python script (50-150 tokens per file vs 2,000-5,000 for full reads), MCP server options. Skill file reference: `examples/skills/smart-explore.md`.

- **Resource Evaluation — Yagr (Y)our (A)gent (G)rounded in (R)eality** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-20-yagr-etienne-lescot.md`): Score 2/5. Watch list. Autonomous automation agent (n8n-as-code execution layer) that generates durable n8n workflows from natural language. Core differentiator is auditability: the workflow persists as an inspectable artifact instead of a disposable script. Scored down due to single-source evidence (author's own LinkedIn + README), star count misattribution (500+ stars belong to n8n-as-code, not Yagr itself), and unverified deploy claim. Re-evaluate in ~3 months if community traction materializes.

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.80** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): `rate_limits` field in statusline for Claude.ai rate limit usage (5h + 7d windows), `source: 'settings'` plugin marketplace (inline declarations in settings.json), `effort` frontmatter for skills/slash commands, `--channels` research preview (MCP servers push messages), fixed `--resume` dropping parallel tool results, ~80MB memory reduction on startup for large repos.

- **Fix: `.fastembed_cache/` added to `.gitignore`**: Prevents the FastEmbed model cache directory from being committed accidentally (generated by grepai/fastembed tooling).

- **Fix: `smart-suggest.sh` typo** (`examples/hooks/bash/smart-suggest.sh`): Corrected "mandato ry" → "mandatory" in the Tier 0 comment block.

## [3.37.2] - 2026-03-19

- **RSS Feed added to cc.bruniaux.com** (`landing: src/pages/rss.xml.ts`, `src/data/rss-entries.ts`): Unified RSS feed at `/rss.xml` merging Claude Code CLI releases and guide content updates (guide releases, new pages, new cards, new whitepapers). Auto-discovery `<link>` tag in all page heads, RSS icon in footer and "More" nav dropdown, mention in announcement banner. Dedicated `rss-entries.ts` data file for manual guide entries. Workflow integrated in `/release` (step 6.5 auto-drafts entry) and `/update-infos-release` (step 4.5 for notable CC releases). Post-push hook in landing repo reminds to update `rss-entries.ts`. README updated with RSS link.

- **Footer links fixed and expanded** (`landing: src/components/global/Footer.astro`): Architecture and Data Privacy now link to in-site guide reader (`/guide/core/architecture/`, `/guide/security/data-privacy/`) instead of GitHub raw files. Added missing pages: Recap Cards, AI Roles, Context, Ecosystem, FAQ.

- **Sitemap updated** (`landing: src/pages/sitemap/index.astro`): RSS Feed entry added in Reference section.

- **Fix — `/release` command updated with RSS step** (`.claude/commands/release.md`): Step 6.5 added — auto-drafts an `rss-entries.ts` entry from CHANGELOG after every release (patch included). Ensures feed stays current without manual effort.

- **Fix — Hook format updated to new matcher+hooks[] structure** (`examples/config/settings.json`, `examples/claude-md/learning-mode.md`, `~/.claude/settings.json`): Claude Code now requires hooks to use `{"matcher": "...", "hooks": [{...}]}` instead of the old flat `{"matcher": "...", "command": "..."}` format. Updated all example files and global settings accordingly.

- **New guide sections: Cross-Model Review, Lightweight Role-Switch, Task Sizing** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Three gaps filled from resource evaluation gap analysis. (1) Cross-model review pattern after SE-CoVe section: generate with one model, review with another, with cost-effective patterns table and custom agent template. (2) Lightweight role-switch review as simpler alternative to SE-CoVe for everyday development. (3) Consolidated task sizing guidance in "Mixing Unrelated Tasks" section with splitting heuristic table and cross-reference to spec-first workflow.

- **Resource Evaluation -- Ischenko "You're probably using Claude Code wrong"** (`docs/resource-evaluations/ischenko-claude-code-workflow-quality.md`): Score 2/5 (marginal, do not integrate). LinkedIn article proposing 7 workflow patterns (reality checks, author/reviewer separation, project-aware reviews, requirements artifacts, TDD, small tasks, human elevation) with copy-paste prompt templates. 75-85% overlap with existing guide content (SE-CoVe, spec-first.md, tdd-with-claude.md, exploration-workflow.md). Headline "30% quality improvement" claim has no methodology. Only non-redundant element: the 7 prompt templates, which are formatting convenience rather than new insight. Two independent gaps surfaced for future work: multi-model review pattern (near zero coverage in guide) and consolidated task sizing section.

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.79** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): `--console` flag for `claude auth login` (API billing auth), Show turn duration toggle in `/config`, VSCode `/remote-control` command + AI-generated session tab titles, fixed `claude -p` hanging without explicit stdin, enterprise 429 retry fix, SessionEnd hooks on `/resume` session switch, ~18MB startup memory improvement.

- **Resource Evaluation — Multi-Session Management Landscape** (`docs/resource-evaluations/082-multi-session-management-landscape.md`): Score 4/5. Landscape overview of 13 tools across 4 categories for managing multiple Claude Code sessions across multiple projects. Monitoring dashboards: ccm (212 stars, TUI + mobile WebUI), sniffly (1 170 stars, analytics), claude-code-dashboard (token/cost per session). Remote access: vibetunnel (4 276 stars), cc-hub (color themes + file diffs). Orchestrators: claudio (22 stars, isolated worktrees + 14 color themes + planning modes), multi-agent-shogun (1 082 stars, tmux fan-out hierarchy). Sound/notifications: no packaged per-project audio solution — DIY via `settings.local.json` + `afplay` hook per project. Recommends integrating a "Multi-Session Management" section in the guide's third-party tools coverage.

- **Resource Evaluation — obra/Superpowers** (`docs/resource-evaluations/obra-superpowers-evaluation.md`): Score 5/5. Full software development methodology suite (95k+ stars, 7.5k forks, verified via GitHub API). 7 context-aware skills: brainstorm-first spec gate, implementation planning, subagent-driven development with two-stage review, mandatory TDD enforcement, code review, git worktrees, branch lifecycle. Available on official Claude Code plugin marketplace. Integrated in 4 locations: Plugin Ecosystem section in `third-party-tools.md` (alongside gstack), obra row upgrade in `ultimate-guide.md` skills.sh table, cross-reference in `tdd-with-claude.md`, cross-reference in `spec-first.md`.

- **Resource Evaluation — ManoMano "Project Aegis"** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-19-manomano-project-aegis-serena.md`): Score 3/5. ManoMano engineering team benchmarked AI coding agents internally and identified Serena MCP as a must-have for large codebase navigation. Serena (oraios/serena) uses LSP for deterministic symbol-level navigation (find_symbol, get_symbols_overview, session memory) — distinct from GrepAI's embedding approach. Guide already covers Serena extensively (8+ files, `ultimate-guide.md:10527`, `search-tools-mastery.md`). Specific gap confirmed: no Serena entry in `mcp-servers-ecosystem.md` (only GrepAI listed under Code Search), creating a discoverability inconsistency. Recommended action: add formal Serena entry to ecosystem file with cross-link to search-tools-mastery.md.

## [3.37.1] - 2026-03-18

- **Threat database updated to v2.8.0** (`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`): 7 new entries covering March 2026 threats. **New campaigns**: GhostClaw (malicious npm `@openclaw-ai/openclawai`, GhostLoader RAT with SOCKS5 proxy + clipboard monitor, 178 downloads) and Fake OpenClaw Installer (Stealth Packer + GhostSocks via malicious GitHub repos indexed by Bing AI). **New malicious packages**: `@openclaw-ai/openclawai` and `ambar-src` (~50K downloads, evasion techniques). **New CVE**: CVE-2026-24910 (Bun runtime v<1.3.5, lifecycle scripts bypass origin validation). **New attack techniques**: T017 Shadow MCP (employees deploying unvetted MCP servers without IT oversight) and T018 AI Search Result Poisoning (AI-generated search results recommending malicious repos). **New scanning tools**: Jozu Agent Guard (zero-trust AI runtime, non-bypassable policies, 2026-03-17) and MCP Sentinel (RSAC 2026, request/arg scanning for sensitive data). `minimum_safe_versions` updated with `bun: 1.3.5`.

- **Claude Code releases tracking updated to v2.1.78** (`machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml`, `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md`): StopFailure hook event, ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA} persistent plugin state, effort/maxTurns/disallowedTools frontmatter for plugin agents, streaming line-by-line, 3 security fixes (silent sandbox disable, MCP deny rules bypass, protected dirs writable in bypassPermissions mode).

- **Skill descriptions improved — 19 skills updated** (`examples/skills/`): cleaner, action-oriented descriptions with explicit "Use when" triggers. Selective merge from @popey (Tessl) PR #9: kept improved `description:` lines while preserving full reference documentation in template skills.

- **Fix — MCP vs CLI token overhead claim updated** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`): corrected outdated token cost figures following v2.1.7 MCP Tool Search (lazy loading). "Token cost of MCP schemas" section rewritten with lazy loading mechanics and measured 85% reduction benchmark (55K → 8.7K for 5-server setup). Credit: Antoine Salesse.

- **Resource Evaluation #081 — Rippletide Code** (`docs/resource-evaluations/081-rippletide-code-rule-enforcement.md`): hook-native runtime rule enforcement for Claude Code (score 3/5, integrate with caveats). Addresses the CLAUDE.md degradation problem: rules ignored after 40+ entries, lost after context compaction.

- **New self-assessment section — Agent Adoption Curve** (`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`): 7-level maturity scale (0-6) for developers to self-locate on the Claude Code sophistication spectrum, adapted from Nicolas Martignole (Back Market) maturity framework.

- **New guide section §5.5 — Registry-based Discovery: ctx7 CLI** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Context7's CLI companion (`npx ctx7`) for automated skill discovery and MCP setup. Resource evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-17-context7-cli.md` (score 4/5).

- **Resource Evaluations #079 + #080** (`docs/resource-evaluations/`): Fabro workflow orchestration (3/5, Watch) and Goose by Block update (4/5) with stats refresh (15.4k → 33k stars), Recipes section, and subagent orchestration documentation.

- **Doc audit — stats sync**: corrected stale counts. Templates unified to 217. Guide lines: "22K" → "23K+". Quiz: 311 → 271.

## [3.37.0] - 2026-03-17

- **ICM v0.5.0 — setup guide + session starter template**: corrected `icm init` documentation (3 explicit modes: `--mode mcp`, `--mode hook`, `--mode skill` — not a single interactive command); fixed CLI syntax (`--importance` is an enum `critical|high|medium|low`, not a float; no `memory` subcommand); added `examples/memory/icm-session-starter.md` ready-to-use onboarding prompt to paste at the start of any session.

- **New guide section — MCP vs CLI Decision Guide** (`guide/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli.md`): full comparison of MCP servers vs CLI tools across 4 decision dimensions (user type, model capability, observability needs, schema stability), decision matrix by situation, token cost analysis, tooling overview (RTK, MCPorter, mcp2cli), and practitioner quotes. Cross-linked from `mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`. Landing page published at `cc.bruniaux.com/ecosystem/mcp-vs-cli/` with 4 decision cards, 15-row collapsible guidance table, practitioner quotes section, and tooling micro-section. `check-landing-sync.sh` extended with section 7 for MCP vs CLI sync tracking.

- **Resource evaluations (3)**: mcp2cli (3/5, MCP/OpenAPI/GraphQL to runtime CLI, 96-99% token savings claim, 8-day-old tool with structural mismatch against Claude Code native MCP architecture — watch list + document schema overhead insight); MCPorter by Steinberger (3/5, TypeScript MCP toolkit with auto-discovery, CLI generation and TS codegen — useful companion for testing MCP servers and hook scripts); CircleCI MCP vs CLI blog (3/5, inner loop / outer loop decision framework, 6-question guide, directional browser automation benchmark — worth borrowing the vocabulary, not the benchmark numbers).

- **WP10 v1.2.0 — Marc Sélince feedback (DAF/finance)**: 6 corrections FR+EN on `10-budget-ia.qmd` / `10-ai-budget.qmd`. New `## Pour le DAF/CFO` section (ROI + OpEx/CapEx framing, replaces placeholder callout). New `## Freins COMEX au-delà du coût` Q&A section (vendor dependency, IP risk, lock-in pricing). §3.1 reframed "Attraction et rétention des top performers" (market tight for seniors/experts, not all profiles). §3.2 CTO: new "ROI des heures d'ingénieur" sub-point (LLMs on mechanical code free engineering time for architecture). §4.1 Budget: option 4 added (replace paid tool with OS equivalent for net-zero pilot), "200-500$/mois" figure removed from discretionary budget.

- **Recap cards — EN translations created + FR fixes**: 57 EN recap cards created from scratch (`whitepapers/recap-cards/en/`) by translating all FR cards. FR cards batch-updated: `guide-version` and `version` fields bumped `3.32.1` → `3.36.0` across all 57 FR cards. Factual fixes: T19 (context window) corrected "1M beta, API only" → "1M GA for Max/Team/Enterprise CC plans (v2.1.75, no header needed)"; T01 (essential commands) updated with `/plan`, `/effort`, `/branch`, `/rename`, `/loop`, `/voice`, `/fast`, removed non-existent `/cost`, corrected keyboard shortcuts. `docs/for-cto.md` updated: "whitepapers coming soon" → links to `florian.bruniaux.com/guides` in all 4 occurrences.

- **Fix dead link** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §3.5): Packmind anchor `../ecosystem/third-party-tools.md#packmind` corrected to `ecosystem/third-party-tools.md#packmind` (wrong `../` prefix was resolving outside `guide/`).

- **Whitepapers v2.2 — Guide content sync (7 WPs updated)**: synced WP content with guide v3.27.6 → v3.36.0 delta.
  - **WP00** (v1.2.0): 1M context corrected "beta" → GA (v2.1.75); 7 major features table added (Tasks API, Auto-memories, Agent Teams, LSP Tool, Remote Control, MCP Elicitation)
  - **WP03** (v1.1.0): PreToolUse security fix callout (v2.1.77 — `"allow"` bypassed enterprise `deny`); `allowRead` sandbox parameter added
  - **WP05** (v1.2.0): Native Code Review section (Research Preview, Teams/Enterprise) — multi-agent, 3 trigger modes, `REVIEW.md`, ~$15-25/PR pricing
  - **WP07** (v1.1.0): 12 new slash commands, 7 new hook events, extended CLI flags, Remote Control section, 1M GA correction
  - **WP08** (v1.2.0): Identity drift after compaction pattern added (UserPromptSubmit hook + agent-identity.txt re-injection)
  - **WP09** (v1.1.0): Review bottleneck inversion section; Regulatory Exposure section (EU AI Act GPAI/high-risk, FDA AI/ML Guidance)
  - WP02: no hook events section in scope; WP01/WP04/WP06/WP10: no gaps identified

- **Cheatsheet + reference.yaml maintenance**: date updated February → March 2026 in `guide/cheatsheet.md`; "Command not found" fix updated to use native installer (`curl | sh`); `machine-readable/reference.yaml` `updated` field bumped to 2026-03-17.

- **Whitepapers v2 — Reviewer corrections** (6 relecteurs: Edouard, Mat, Nicolas, Marc, Anthony, Emmanuel): 8-phase correction plan applied across 10 whitepapers (WP00–WP10) FR+EN.
  - **Phase 1 — Factual errors**: npm "deprecated" → "not recommended" (WP00), native installer added as primary install method (WP00 EN), context window 200K vs 1M clarified (WP00 FR+EN), Claude Max ratio corrected to range 1.5-3% FR / 1-1.6% EN (WP10), sub-agents vs agent teams difference correctly stated as P2P messaging + coordination tools, not context isolation (WP08 EN)
  - **Phase 2 — Accents + articles + typos**: ~200+ accent corrections across WP08 FR (977 lines); anglicisms corrected in WP02 FR (on-demand, per-project, Memories, Feature opt-in); table row reformulated in WP00 FR; accents restored in WP02 FR (~10 passages)
  - **Phase 3 — Malformed sentences**: "chez dans une fintech" fixed, meta-sentence "This is the single definition..." removed (WP08 FR+EN); "Multiple Claude instances..." rewritten as complete sentence (WP05 FR+EN); Turnkey Quickstart explained (WP05 FR+EN)
  - **Phase 4 — Anglicisms + clarifications**: tmux noted as external tool, not built-in (WP08 FR+EN); "OUI →" residue fixed in WP05 EN; user-level/project-level translated (WP05 FR)
  - **Phase 6 — WP08 structural corrections**: "~30K lines" clarified as "~30K lines ≈ 1M tokens"; continuous merge definition improved; note added that solo Claude Code agent is a full autonomous agent, not a chatbot
  - **Phase 7 — WP10 restructuration**: executive summary added (5 key metrics); learning curve duplication removed; BCG 2025 source improved; pricing note "March 2026" added; "5-10 people in 2020" reformulated without unsourced claim; "Beyond engineering teams" section expanded with 3 concrete use cases; CFO/DAF and change management placeholder callouts added

- **Resource Evaluation #078 + integration** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): HumanLayer — "Skill Issue: Harness Engineering for Coding Agents" (March 12, 2026). Score 3/5. "Harness Engineer" concept already covered in `guide/roles/ai-roles.md §10` (Martin Fowler source); ETH Zürich study already integrated. Two genuine gaps filled: (1) **Silent Success hook pattern** — asymmetric hook behavior (exit 0 = silence, exit 2 = re-engage agent) named and documented with example before §7.3; (2) **CLI vs MCP training-data argument** — familiar CLIs (git/grep/jq) are already in model weights, CLAUDE.md usage examples often beat a verbose MCP server for standard tools; added after MCP Tool Search section.

## [3.36.0] - 2026-03-17

### Documentation

- **Resource Evaluation #076**: Addy Osmani — "Stop Using /init for AGENTS.md" (Feb 23, 2026). Score 3/5. Secondary synthesis of ETH Zürich paper (already evaluated). Verified: ETH Zürich claims confirmed. Unverified: Lulla et al. (ICSE JAWs 2026) and ACE framework (ICLR 2026) — no findable academic source. Arize AI concept verified, specific numbers uncorroborated. Integration: added discoverability filter + anchoring risk concepts to §3.1, added research note (ETH Zürich), added `/init` warning in commands table.

- **Resource Evaluation #077 + integration** (`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`): "Comprehension Debt" article (LinkedIn, March 14, 2026). Score 3/5. Integrated: (1) "comprehension debt" as emerging term after Vibe Coding section, (2) review bottleneck inversion framing — juniors can now generate code faster than seniors can audit, (3) new "Regulatory Exposure" subsection for tech leads covering EU AI Act active dates (GPAI Aug 2025, high-risk Aug 2026) and FDA AI guidance (Jan + Jun 2025). Confirmed by Perplexity research.

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.77
  - Opus 4.6 default max output raised to 64k tokens; upper bound for Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 raised to 128k tokens
  - Security fix: `PreToolUse` hooks returning `"allow"` could bypass enterprise `deny` permission rules
  - `allowRead` sandbox setting; `/branch` replaces `/fork`; `/copy N` for Nth-latest response
  - Breaking: `Agent` tool `resume` parameter removed — use `SendMessage({to: agentId})` instead
  - Fixed auto-updater GBs memory leak; fixed `--resume` truncating recent history

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.76
  - MCP elicitation support — servers request structured input mid-task via interactive dialog
  - New hooks: `Elicitation`, `ElicitationResult`, `PostCompact`
  - `-n`/`--name` CLI flag for session display name; `worktree.sparsePaths` for monorepo sparse checkout
  - `/effort` slash command; fixed ToolSearch deferred tools losing schemas after compaction
  - Auto-compact circuit breaker (stops after 3 failures); fixed `Bash(cmd:*)` rules with `#` in args

- **Resource evaluation** (rejected, no file): LinkedIn post "Five Levels of Context Engineering" by Matthew Alverson (via Addy Osmani) — score 1/5, rejected. Content is a pedagogical reformulation of concepts already covered with more rigor in `guide/core/context-engineering.md`. Alverson's 5-level taxonomy is not empirically grounded and not widely cited in the literature. Evaluation surfaced 3 real gaps now addressed (see Added section). Better primary sources identified: Anthropic Engineering Blog (Sept 2025), MCP Maturity Model (Mitra, Nov 2025).

- **Resource evaluation** (no file — text digest): Anthropic weekly recap March 9-15, 2026 (5 Claude Code releases, Code Review launch, 1M GA, Spring Break promo, corporate news) — score 4/5. Two gaps actioned: (1) Code Review product feature added as `guide/workflows/code-review.md`; (2) 1M context status updated from beta to GA in `guide/ultimate-guide.md` lines 2021-2070. Source reliability note: digest incorrectly attributes Claude Code changelog to `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python` (correct repo: `anthropics/claude-code`); Code Review pricing ($15-25/PR) verified against official docs.

- **Resource evaluation** (`docs/resource-evaluations/eval-claude-1m-context-window-jp-caparas.md`): JP Caparas article on 1M token context window — score 2/5, do not integrate. Central claim (flat pricing, no surcharge above 200K tokens) is factually wrong; invalidates the competitive pricing analysis. Fact-check table, comparative analysis vs guide, and independent action items (verify 1M GA status, potential update to guide lines 2028-2070 on beta/GA status).

### Changed

- **External support section — clarified positioning** (`docs/for-cto.md`, `docs/for-tech-leads.md`, `docs/for-cio-ceo.md`): Brown Bag Lunch, talks, and speaker/panelist slots (1-3h) explicitly marked as free and done for networking/challenge purposes. Training/consulting missions framed as open-but-not-actively-sought with "contact for availability and potentially pricing" wording. Contact link updated to `florian.bruniaux.com` across all three files.

### Fixed

- **`/release` skill — 3 correctness gaps** (`.claude/commands/release.md` Step 4): (1) Quiz count command fixed: `grep -c '  - id:'` was returning per-file counts and taking only the last file's value — replaced with `grep -r '  - id:' quiz/questions/ | wc -l` to sum across the entire directory. (2) `llms-full.txt` now documents all 4 occurrences requiring update (Metadata block, "For Learning" URL text, "Template Library" section heading, repo tree comment) — previously only Metadata fields were listed, causing silent drift. (3) Verification gate added after Step 4: bash block prints all three llms files' key fields side-by-side against expected values before the commit, making any mismatch visible immediately.

### Added

- **Resource evaluation #078: claude-swarm-monitor** (`docs/resource-evaluations/078-claude-swarm-monitor.md`): TUI dashboard (Rust + Ratatui) for monitoring multi-agent Claude Code workflows across git worktrees. Score 3/5 — watch-list. Unique angles: JSONL-native session file monitoring (distinct from agent-chat's SSE approach) and Docker stack visibility per worktree. Not integrated into guide yet — 10 stars, Linux-only, sub-agent tracking claim unverified. Re-evaluate at 50+ stars or confirmed macOS production use.

- **Packmind — Engineering Standards Distribution** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, `guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/ecosystem/mcp-servers-ecosystem.md`): Added Packmind (score 4/5, eval #076) as a new "Engineering Standards Distribution" section in third-party-tools. Tool distributes CLAUDE.md + slash commands + skills across repos and agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf) from a single playbook, ships an MCP server, Apache-2.0 CLI self-hostable. Added cross-reference paragraph at end of ultimate-guide.md §3.5 (Team Configuration at Scale) linking the per-project `.claude/rules/` pattern to org-scale tooling. Added Packmind MCP server entry in mcp-servers-ecosystem.md Orchestration section.

- **3 new AI roles** (`guide/roles/ai-roles.md`): Added MLOps Engineer (§14), AI Developer Advocate (§15), and AI Orchestration Engineer (§16) as full role profiles. Includes responsibilities, required skills, salary benchmarks, entry paths, and key distinctions from adjacent roles. Sections 14→17 renumbered accordingly. Removed "Orchestration engineer" from "What's Not a Role Yet" — job postings at Vista Equity, Zapier, Heidi Health, and Adobe confirm it's now a real title. Career Decision Matrix and Salary Benchmarks updated with all 3 roles. Based on Perplexity market research (March 2026).

- **Failure-triggered context drift pattern** (`guide/core/architecture.md` §Session Degradation Limits): New subsection documenting a distinct degradation mode from compaction drift — repeated tool failures accumulate error noise that dilutes the original intent without filling the context window. Pattern: re-inject core task instructions on every command failure via `PostToolUse` hook, not just after `/compact`. Source: Nick Tune (2026-03-01). Resource evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-16-nick-tune-workflow-dsl-ddd.md` (score 3/5 — 1 of 3 patterns integrated).

- **Identity re-injection after compaction** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §7.5 + `examples/hooks/bash/identity-reinjection.sh`): New hook pattern from Nick Tune (Feb 2026). Solves agent identity drift after context compaction in long sessions — `UserPromptSubmit` hook reads transcript, detects missing identity marker in last assistant message, re-injects `.claude/agent-identity.txt` as `additionalContext`. Configurable via `CLAUDE_IDENTITY_FILE` and `CLAUDE_IDENTITY_MARKER` env vars. `reference.yaml` updated with `identity_reinjection_hook` + `identity_reinjection_example` keys.

- **Security audit hardening — 3 patterns** (`examples/commands/security-audit.md`, `examples/agents/security-auditor.md`): (1) Pre-step added to `/security-audit`: asks dev/staging/prod before running — avoids false positives on debug flags and CORS `*` in local dev. (2) Anti-false-positive rule in Phase 2 (secrets scan): mandates running `git log --all -p` and checking `.gitignore` before raising any secret finding — no more findings based on pattern matching alone. (3) Paywall/billing checklist added to `security-auditor.md` under A04 Insecure Design: server-side limit enforcement, subscription status from DB, webhook signature verification, billing bypass endpoints, race conditions on resource creation.

- **Resource evaluation: VicKayro — claude-security-audit** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-16-vickairo-claude-security-audit.md`): Score 2/5. Single-file `/security-audit` command, OWASP Top 10 (2021) + 16 sections, MIT, 60 stars (18 days old). Substantial overlap with existing `security-audit.md`, `security-auditor.md`, and `security-hardening.md`. Genuine gaps: paywall/billing audit section (not covered anywhere), environment context pre-step (dev/staging/prod before auditing), and stricter anti-false-positive pattern for secrets (mandate `git log --all -p` proof before raising finding). Decision: extract 3 patterns into existing commands silently, no guide mention, revisit at 200+ stars.

- **Resource evaluation: Nick Tune — Hook-Driven Dev Workflows** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-16-nick-tune-hook-driven-workflows.md`): Score 3/5. Covers hooks-as-workflow-engine pattern: typed state machine (Zod), per-state SubagentStart context injection, agent respawn for fresh context windows, identity re-injection after compaction, JSON workflow persistence. Key gap confirmed: guide lacks identity re-injection after compaction + per-state SubagentStart injection. Tiered integration: identity re-injection → §7.5 now; SubagentStart injection → agent-teams.md (3-4 weeks); full state machine guide deferred 60-90 days (1 week of author testing, needs community validation). Prerequisites: CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1, Opus 4.6, Node.js + TypeScript.

- **1M context window status update** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` lines ~2021-2070): Updated from "beta" to GA for Max/Team/Enterprise Claude Code plans (v2.1.75, March 13 2026). Preserved distinction: direct API use still requires tier 4 / custom rate limits. Pricing table updated to reflect standard rates for plan users.

- **Code Review feature** (`guide/workflows/code-review.md` + cross-reference in `guide/ultimate-guide.md`): New workflow guide for Anthropic's Code Review research preview (Teams/Enterprise). Covers: multi-agent architecture and severity levels (🔴/🟡/🟣), full setup flow (admin URL `claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code`, GitHub App permissions, 3 trigger modes — once/every push/manual), `@claude review` manual trigger, `REVIEW.md` schema with example, pricing model ($15-25 avg, billed via extra usage outside plan, spend cap at `claude.ai/admin-settings/usage`), analytics dashboard, and cross-links to manual CLI workflows + GitLab CI/CD. Verified against official docs at `code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review`.

- **Context engineering guide — 3 additions** (`guide/core/context-engineering.md`):
  - **"Most failures are context failures"** framing added to §1 Why It Matters — reframes troubleshooting from "the AI is bad" to "what's missing from context"
  - **Static vs. Dynamic context** — new subsection distinguishing CLAUDE.md (static) from runtime tool outputs and agent context (dynamic); includes reference to Anthropic's September 2025 engineering post on agent context engineering
  - **Maturity assessment §9** — Level 0-5 self-assessment grid grounded in Claude Code patterns (no CLAUDE.md → flat config → structured → modular → measured → full system); includes "what to do at each level" action table

- **Spring Break promotion note** (guide line ~2395): Documented Anthropic's March 13-27, 2026 promotion — 2x usage limits outside 5-11am PT (peak hours) and all weekends, bonus usage doesn't count against weekly limits, applies to Free/Pro/Max/Team. Includes CET timezone conversion for European users (2x from midnight-13h and 19h-24h France time). Source: Anthropic support article.

- **Smart-Suggest ROI script** (`examples/scripts/smart-suggest-roi.py`): Python stdlib-only analyzer for the `smart-suggest` UserPromptSubmit hook. Correlates suggestion log (`~/.claude/logs/smart-suggest.jsonl`) with session JSONL files to estimate command acceptance rate. Detects 4 acceptance signals: slash command tags, Skill tool use, Agent tool use, and text mention in next 5 user messages. Reports: summary, tier breakdown (Enforcement/Discovery/Contextual/Custom), top suggested/followed commands, never-followed list, and daily trend chart. CLI: `--since Nd`, `--no-sessions` (fast mode), `--json`, `--log PATH`.
- **ICM (Infinite Context Memory)**: New MCP memory server section after Kairn (~line 11365) — Rust single binary, zero deps, Homebrew install, dual architecture (episodic decay Memories + permanent knowledge graph Memoirs), 9 typed relation types, auto-extraction 3 layers, 14 editor clients. Score 3/5 — recommended as Rust-native alternative when Python dependency management is a friction point. Includes explicit license callout (Source-Available, free ≤20 people) and vendor-reported benchmark flags.
- **Comparison matrix update**: Added ICM column to MCP memory stack matrix (Runtime + License rows added for all tools)

## [3.35.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **`guide/workflows/github-actions.md`** — 5 production-ready patterns for GitHub Actions CI/CD with `anthropics/claude-code-action` (6.2k stars, v1.0): on-demand PR review via `@claude` mention, automatic review on every push, issue triage and labeling, security-focused review on sensitive paths (`auth/**`, `payments/**`), scheduled weekly repo health check. Includes cost control table (Haiku vs Sonnet per pattern), concurrency setup, fork safety (`pull_request_target` guard), Bedrock/Vertex auth alternatives. Cross-linked from guide §9.3 and `guide/workflows/README.md`.

- **`guide/workflows/rpi.md`** — RPI: Research → Plan → Implement. 3-phase feature development with explicit GO gates: Research → `RESEARCH.md`, Plan → `PLAN.md`, Implement → working code. Slash command templates (`/rpi:research`, `/rpi:plan`, `/rpi:implement`), worked example (rate limiting on Express API), and comparison matrix vs Plan-Driven, TDD, Spec-First. Best for features where discovering a wrong assumption late is expensive.

- **`guide/workflows/changelog-fragments.md`** — Changelog Fragments workflow: one YAML fragment per PR, written at implementation time, validated by CI, assembled at release. 3-layer enforcement: CLAUDE.md workflow rule + `UserPromptSubmit` hook (3-tier: enforcement → discovery → contextual) + independent CI migration check. Documents the `UserPromptSubmit` tier pattern as a reusable architecture for any mandatory workflow step.

- **`examples/hooks/bash/smart-suggest.sh`** — `UserPromptSubmit` behavioral coach hook: Tier 0 enforcement (changelog fragment required before PR, plan-before-code), Tier 1 discovery (test-loop, retex, dupes, monitoring loop, security audit, release), Tier 2 contextual (code review, debugging, architecture, session resume). Max 1 suggestion per prompt, dedup guard, ROI logging to `~/.claude/logs/smart-suggest.jsonl`, silent exit on no match.

- **`guide/core/known-issues.md`** — "LLM Day-to-Day Performance Variance" section: session-to-session quality variance (shorter responses, conservative suggestions, edge-case refusals) documented as expected behavior, not a bug. 4 root causes: probabilistic inference, MoE routing variance, infrastructure variance, context sensitivity. Observable signals table and ruling-out checklist.

- **`examples/scripts/test-prompt-caching.ts`** — Standalone TypeScript script (zero deps, native fetch) to verify Anthropic prompt caching on any API key. Runs 3 identical calls, checks write/read metrics. Documents 4 undocumented production gotchas: `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31` header required for Claude 4.x, effective threshold ~2048+ tokens, cached tokens excluded from `input_tokens`, new nested `cache_creation` object format.

- **`cc-sessions discover` documentation** — "Session Pattern Discovery" subsection in §2.x: `discover` subcommand n-gram mode (local, ~3s) vs `--llm` mode (semantic via `claude --print`), 20% rule decision framework (CLAUDE.md rule / skill / command), install instructions. Cross-reference added after the 20% rule callout in §5.1.

- **`examples/scripts/cc-sessions.py`** — Synced from 498-line stale copy to full 1225-line version from `~/bin/cc-sessions`: complete `discover` subcommand, incremental cache, Jaccard deduplication, all filtering logic. GitHub source header added.

- **GitHub repo [FlorianBruniaux/cc-sessions](https://github.com/FlorianBruniaux/cc-sessions)** — v1.0.0 published with curl install instructions.

### Updated

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`** — Two additions: cross-reference callout to `github-actions.md` in CI/CD section; "Fighting Vibe Code Degradation" subsection covering desloppify ([peteromallet/desloppify](https://github.com/peteromallet/desloppify)) — scan → next → fix → resolve loop as a Claude Code skill, early-stage (Feb 2026, ~2K stars), token cost caveat.

- **`examples/commands/resources/threat-db.yaml`** — v2.7.0 (2026-03-13). +5 threat sources: CVE-2026-26118 Azure MCP Server SSRF (THN/Tenable), OpenClaw agentic AI risk (ReversingLabs), Taskflow Agent scanner (GitHub Security Lab), OpenAI Codex Security research preview, DryRun Security 87% vulnerability rate in AI-built PRs.

- **`CLAUDE.md`** — "Behavioral Rules" section: 5 rules from observed session friction: always update CHANGELOG.md, exhaustive first pass, absolute paths, closing checklist, bias toward action.

- **`examples/scripts/README.md`** — cc-sessions entry updated with `discover` subcommand examples, GitHub repo link, curl install instructions.

- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml`** — Added `cc_sessions_github`, `cc_sessions_discover`, `changelog_fragments_*`, `smart_suggest_hook`, `rpi_*` entries.

## [3.34.11] - 2026-03-13

### Updated

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`** (§ Cost Optimization → Strategy 6): Added `#### How Claude Code Handles Caching Automatically` subsection (~75 lines) covering the mechanics that were previously a single undocumented footnote. New content: (1) **Cache prefix hierarchy** — `tools → system → messages` ordering and why the first two layers almost always hit; (2) **20-block lookback** — the long-session cache degradation trap and why `/compact` restores hit rates; (3) **Minimum token thresholds by model** — eligibility table for Opus/Sonnet/Haiku families (1,024–4,096 tokens), correcting the previously circulating false "32,000 token maximum" claim; (4) **Tool result size and cache economics** — why compact tool outputs reduce both cache write and read costs proportionally across the entire session; (5) **Monitoring in custom pipelines** — `cache_creation_input_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens` response fields, hit rate calculation formula, and why no dedicated CC cache monitoring tool currently exists; (6) **Practical rules** — CLAUDE.md stability, pre-emptive `/compact` timing, avoiding dynamic content in stable sections.

## [3.34.10] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Quiz expanded: 277 → 311 questions (+34)** — 33 new questions covering topics added since the last quiz audit, across 9 categories: `modelOverrides`/`autoMemoryDirectory` settings (v2.1.73-74), tool-qualified deny format `Read(file_path:*.env*)`, CLAUDE.md HTML comment hiding (v2.1.72), `spinnerVerbs`/`spinnerTipsOverride` terminal personalization, team config at scale (N×M×P fragmentation, 59% token reduction), `/loop`/`/simplify`/`/batch`/`/stats`/`/rename` commands (v2.1.63-71), `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove`/`TeammateIdle`/`TaskCompleted` hook events (v2.1.50 + v2.1.32+), auto-rename-session hook pattern, Git MCP vs GitHub MCP (12 local tools vs remote Copilot-required), Context Engineering 150% ceiling + ACE pipeline, Plan-Validate-Execute 3-command workflow, dual-instance planning (Jon Williams, $100-200/month), `isolation: "worktree"` in agent frontmatter, simplified effort levels ○◐● (v2.1.72, max removed), Fast mode (2.5x faster/6x price), `model` parameter restored on Agent tool (v2.1.72), `/context` actionable suggestions (v2.1.74), METR RCT 2025 (19% slower on large codebases), Borg "Echoes of AI" RCT 2025 (30.7% faster, no maintainability regression), Contribution Metrics platform feature (+67% PRs/day), enterprise governance 4 guardrail tiers (Starter/Standard/Strict/Regulated), MCP governance workflow + YAML registry, native sandbox OS primitives (macOS Seatbelt vs Linux bubblewrap), `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` escape hatch, RTK (60-92% token reduction, TOML Filter DSL), Google Antigravity (agent-first IDE). 1 question corrected: `12-architecture-internals/002` updated to reflect Tasks API replacing TodoWrite (v2.1.16+).
- **Quiz counters synced**: `machine-readable/reference.yaml` (`quiz_count: 311`), `llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt` + `machine-readable/llms.txt` (`Quiz Questions: 311`).

## [3.34.9] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **`guide/workflows/gstack-workflow.md`** — New workflow guide (140 lines) documenting the "Cognitive Mode Switching" pattern: switching between specialist roles across the ship cycle (strategic gate → architecture → paranoid review → release → browser QA → retrospective). Reference implementation: [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) by Garry Tan (YC CEO). Covers the 6 gears table, the pre-implementation strategic gate concept ("are we building the right thing?"), `/browse` non-MCP native browser architecture (persistent Chromium daemon, ~100ms/cmd vs MCP), full cycle demo, and when to use vs Plan Pipeline.

- **`examples/commands/plan-ceo-review.md`** — New command template for the strategic product gate. Three modes: SCOPE EXPANSION (find the 10-star product), HOLD SCOPE (make the plan bulletproof), SCOPE REDUCTION (strip to MVP). Includes full prompt template, concrete example (photo upload → smart listing creation), and integration notes. Inspired by gstack's `/plan-ceo-review` skill.

- **`examples/commands/plan-eng-review.md`** — New command template for the engineering architecture gate. Forces diagram generation (architecture, sequence, state machine), sync/async boundary decisions, failure mode inventory, trust boundary map, and test matrix before implementation. Includes Mermaid diagram examples and integration notes. Inspired by gstack's `/plan-eng-review` skill.

### Updated

- **`guide/workflows/README.md`**: Added Cognitive Mode Switching entry to Development Workflows section. Added two rows to Quick Selection Guide: "Strategic gate before coding" and "Non-MCP browser automation".

- **`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`** (Plugin Ecosystem section): Added gstack as the first entry under a new "Notable skill packs" subsection, with cross-reference to the workflow guide.

## [3.34.8] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`examples/hooks/bash/smart-suggest.sh`** — Production-ready `UserPromptSubmit` hook implementing a 3-tier behavioral coaching architecture (Tier 0: enforcement, Tier 1: discovery, Tier 2: contextual). Features: max 1 suggestion per prompt, dedup guard (never suggests a command already in the prompt), JSONL ROI logging to `~/.claude/logs/smart-suggest.jsonl`, and silent exit on no match. Includes changelog fragment enforcement as the canonical Tier 0 example (conditional "if PR-intent without fragment-mention" pattern), plus 10 additional patterns across all three tiers. Directly reusable as a starting point for any project-level behavioral enforcement hook.

- **`guide/workflows/changelog-fragments.md`** — New workflow guide documenting the 3-layer changelog fragment enforcement pattern: (1) CLAUDE.md workflow rule for autonomous fragment creation by Claude, (2) `UserPromptSubmit` hook with tier-priority system for pre-prompt interception, (3) CI gate with two independent jobs (fragment validation + migration flag check). Explains why each layer is necessary, how they compose without conflicting, and how to adopt the pattern independent of the TypeScript implementation.

### Updated

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`** (§ Release Notes Generation): Added `### Changelog Fragments: Per-PR Enforcement Pattern` subsection covering the 3-layer approach with fragment YAML example, hook snippet, and assembly command. Positioned as an alternative to commit-based release notes generation, with links to the workflow guide and hook example.

- **`guide/workflows/README.md`**: Added Changelog Fragments entry to Development Workflows section with key topics (CLAUDE.md rule, UserPromptSubmit 3-tier hook, conditional suggestion pattern, independent CI migration check). Added to Quick Selection Guide under "Enforce mandatory workflow steps".

## [3.34.7] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`guide/diagrams/11-context-engineering.md`** — 4 new Mermaid diagrams covering context engineering: 3-layer context system (global/project/session scopes), context budget and adherence degradation curve (95%→45% zones + path-scoping fix), monolithic vs modular CLAUDE.md architecture (anti-pattern vs path-scoped approach), and rule placement decision tree.

- **`guide/diagrams/12-enterprise-governance.md`** — 3 new Mermaid diagrams covering enterprise governance: 4-tier risk model (Starter/Team/Production/Regulated with controls per tier), MCP governance approval workflow (sequenceDiagram: submit → audit → classify → registry → deploy → monitor), and data classification matrix (PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED with access rules).

### Updated

- **`guide/diagrams/01-foundations.md`**: Added Plan Mode and dontAsk as two new permission mode subgraphs (was showing 3/5 modes, now all 5 CLI permission modes are documented).

- **`guide/diagrams/04-architecture-internals.md`**: Added Control Flow Tools as a 6th tool category (EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode, EnterWorktree/ExitWorktree, AskUserQuestion). Count updated 5→6.

- **`guide/diagrams/05-mcp-ecosystem.md`**: Added clarifying note that local + user scopes both live in `~/.claude.json` (separate configuration keys), not in separate files. Description updated "4 different locations" → "4 priority levels (3 actual files)".

- **`guide/diagrams/07-multi-agent-patterns.md`**: Fixed disconnected B2 node — now properly connected as a third branch off the pattern-selection flow.

- **`guide/diagrams/09-cost-and-optimization.md`**: Replaced hardcoded USD prices with relative ratios (Haiku ~5x cheaper than Sonnet, Opus ~5x more than Sonnet) and added disclaimer pointing to anthropic.com/pricing.

- **`guide/diagrams/README.md`**: Updated diagram count 41→48, extended navigation table with files 11 and 12, added two new use-case navigation sections ("govern Claude Code across my team", "improve Claude's context adherence").

## [3.34.6] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **`guide/workflows/rpi.md`** — New RPI (Research → Plan → Implement) workflow guide (560 lines). 3-phase feature development pattern with explicit validation gates: GO/NO-GO gate after Research, plan approval gate before any code is written, and per-step test gates during implementation. Includes full RESEARCH.md and PLAN.md templates, 3 slash command templates (`/rpi:research`, `/rpi:plan`, `/rpi:implement`), worked example (API rate limiting), comparison table vs dual-instance/spec-first/TDD/direct, and troubleshooting section. Inspired by community patterns from claude-code-best-practice.

- **LLM Day-to-Day Performance Variance** (`guide/core/known-issues.md`): New section documenting session-to-session output variance as expected behavior (not a bug). Covers root causes (MoE routing variance, infrastructure variance, probabilistic inference, context sensitivity), observable signals table (response length, refusals, code style, creativity, verbosity), clear distinction from the Aug-Sep 2025 infrastructure bugs, and 5 mitigation strategies (constrain prompts, fresh context, reformulate and retry, compare against known-good prompt, calibrate by task type).

### Updated

- **`guide/ultimate-guide.md`** (§ Quick Decision Tree): Added RPI entry — "Feasibility is unknown → workflows/rpi.md"
- **`machine-readable/reference.yaml`**: Added 8 new entries — `rpi_workflow`, `rpi_when_to_use`, `rpi_phase1_research`, `rpi_phase2_plan`, `rpi_phase3_implement`, `rpi_slash_commands`, `rpi_vs_other_workflows`, `known_issues_llm_variance`

## [3.34.5] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Blast-Radius Pattern** (grepai section, §8.2): Named pre-refactoring workflow using `grepai trace callers/callees` to enumerate all affected call sites before touching a widely-used function. Run before the refactor, not after compile errors. Includes 3-step bash example.

- **Pre-structural indexing** (§9.13 Token-Saving Techniques): New technique #6 documenting the concept of building a codebase structural index before starting a session. Replaces 5-10 sequential file reads with 1 graph query (~75% fewer tool calls for discovery tasks). Includes CodeXRay setup example (`npx codexray`, `cxr watch`).

- **Dead code & circular dependency detection** (§9.13): Documents three structural analysis patterns — dead code detection (`grepai trace callers` returning zero results), circular dependency identification, and hotspot analysis — as token optimization strategies. References CodeXRay and Claudette as alpha-stage community implementations with grepai as the stable alternative.

## [3.34.4] - 2026-03-12

### Documentation

  - v2.1.73: `modelOverrides` setting, deadlock fix for skill hot-reload, subagent model downgrade fix on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry, Opus 4.6 as default on 3P providers, `/output-style` deprecated

## [3.34.3] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **MCP Server v1.1.0**: 4 new tools for tracking official Anthropic Claude Code docs
  - `init_official_docs()` — fetch and store a local baseline snapshot (runs once)
  - `refresh_official_docs()` — update the "current" snapshot without touching the baseline
  - `diff_official_docs()` — compare baseline vs current at section level, zero network calls
  - `search_official_docs(query)` — search official docs, loads only matching sections
- **Local cache architecture**: 4 files in `~/.cache/claude-code-guide/` (index + content, baseline + current). Diff reads only lightweight index files (~50KB), never the full 1.2MB doc. Atomic writes via `.tmp` + rename to prevent corruption.
- **5 new slash commands** (`/ccguide:init-docs`, `/ccguide:refresh-docs`, `/ccguide:diff-docs`, `/ccguide:search-docs`, `/ccguide:daily`) — documented in `ultimate-guide.md` and added to `.claude/commands/ccguide/`
- **`/ccguide:daily`** orchestrates the full daily workflow: refresh → diff official docs → guide/CC digest in one shot

Includes CI size check pattern.

- **`examples/scripts/og-image-astro.ts`** — Production-ready template for `src/pages/og-image.png.ts`. Drop into any Astro 5 project. Auto-serves at `/og-image.png`, counts content files dynamically, includes stat card component, author signature, and inline comments on every gotcha.

## [3.34.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Context Engineering Configurator** (`cc.bruniaux.com/context/`) — Interactive multi-step configurator that generates a personalized CLAUDE.md starter kit. 5-screen flow: profile (team size, AI tools), current state (existing CLAUDE.md, rules files), stack (language, frontend), results (generated artifacts + maturity assessment).

## [3.33.0] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **`guide/security/enterprise-governance.md` — Accuracy review pass** — 6 correctness issues fixed after adversarial critique: (1) Non-existent hooks removed from all tier `settings.json` configs (`dependency-guard.sh`, `compliance-pre-check.sh`, `pii-detector.sh`, `compliance-session-init.sh` were referenced but never existed in `examples/hooks/bash/`); (2) `compliance-audit-logger.sh` in Regulated tier replaced with real `session-logger.sh`; (3) Fabricated Claude Code API removed — `CLAUDE_SETTINGS` env var and `claude run-headless` subcommand don't exist; replaced with an honest CI pipeline validation pattern; (4) `date -d '30 days ago'` (GNU coreutils only) fixed to cross-platform with macOS/Linux `$OSTYPE` check; (5) Customer PII reclassified from CONFIDENTIAL to RESTRICTED — Enterprise plan (ZDR) alone doesn't satisfy GDPR/CCPA; (6) All `// comment` lines inside JSON code blocks removed (invalid JSON, breaks copy-paste).

### Added

- **Enterprise AI Governance section** (`guide/security/enterprise-governance.md`) — New guide covering org-level governance for teams deploying Claude Code at scale. 6 sections: (1) Local vs Shared governance split (risk matrix, decision framework); (2) AI Usage Charter — lean template covering approved tools, data classification, use case boundaries, approval matrix; (3) MCP Governance Workflow — approval pipeline (request → review → approve → deploy), YAML registry format, enforcement hook; (4) Guardrail Tiers — 4 pre-configured tiers (Starter/Standard/Strict/Regulated) with ready-to-copy `settings.json` and `CLAUDE.md` additions; (5) Policy Enforcement at Scale — config distribution, onboarding checklist, compliance audit script, role-based guardrails, CI/CD gates; (6) Audit & Compliance — what SOC2/ISO27001 auditors actually ask, audit trail setup, AI Governance Committee minimal structure. Audience: tech leads, engineering managers, security officers. Complements security-hardening.md (individual dev security) and production-safety.md (6 prod rules).

- **MCP Registry Template** (`examples/scripts/mcp-registry-template.yaml`) — Ready-to-use YAML format for tracking approved MCP servers at org level. Includes approved/pending/denied sections, version bump policy, risk classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), data scope classification (PUBLIC/INTERNAL/CONFIDENTIAL/RESTRICTED), and expiry dates.

- **Governance Enforcement Hook** (`examples/hooks/bash/governance-enforcement-hook.sh`) — SessionStart hook validating active MCP configuration against org's approved registry, checking deny rules for secret files, and detecting dangerous `permissions.allow` overrides. Warns without blocking (governance-first, not friction-first).

- **AI Usage Charter Template** (`examples/scripts/ai-usage-charter-template.md`) — Org-level charter template covering approved tools, data classification (4 levels), approved/prohibited use cases, MCP server governance, code review and attribution requirements, accountability roles, incident response, and compliance mapping (SOC2/ISO27001/HIPAA/PCI DSS/GDPR).

### Documentation

- **`guide/roles/adoption-approaches.md`** — Added "Enterprise Rollout (50+ developers)" section with 3-phase rollout approach (Foundation/Adoption/Optimization), common rollout mistakes at scale, and pointer to enterprise-governance.md for compliance programs.

- **`/loop` command added to Commands Table §10.1** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`) — `/loop [interval] [prompt]` runs a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. `/loop 5m check the deploy`). v2.1.71+. Was already in cheatsheet (v3.32.2), now present in the reference table.

- **Voice keybindings documented §10.2** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`) — new "Voice Input" subsection in Keyboard Shortcuts: push-to-talk default binding (`Space`), `voice:pushToTalk` rebindable in `~/.claude/keybindings.json` (v2.1.71+), example config included.

- **Claude Code Security note enriched §7.4** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`) — added Mozilla Firefox validation context (March 2026): Opus 4.6 scanned ~6,000 C++ files in Firefox's JS engine, surfaced 22 confirmed vulnerabilities (14 high severity) in two weeks. Reinforces the "limited research preview" note with production evidence.

- **Pipelex + MTHDS added** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`) — new entry in "External Orchestration Frameworks" for Pipelex, Python runtime of the open MTHDS standard. Declarative DSL (`.mthds` files) for creating typed, git-versionable, multi-LLM AI methods. Integrates natively with Claude Code via `/plugin marketplace add mthds-ai/skills`. 623 stars (MIT, created May 2025). Status "Watch" — MTHDS standard not yet validated at scale. Architectural note distinguishing Pipelex (DSL for pipelines) from Ruflo/AthenaFlow (agent orchestration).

- **Diagrams updated — 3 files** (`guide/diagrams/`) — Mermaid diagrams updated following releases v2.1.59–v2.1.69 and documentation corrections v3.29–v3.31. (1) `02-context-and-sessions.md`: Memory Hierarchy goes from 5 to 6 types — addition of **Native Auto-Memory** (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md`, v2.1.59+) between Subdirectory CLAUDE.md and In-Conversation Context, cross-session scope, distinct green style from ephemeral types. (2) `03-configuration-system.md`: Hooks Event Pipeline enriched with 3 new events — `InstructionsLoaded` (v2.1.69+, session start), `UserPromptSubmit` (before PreToolUse, exit 2 = feedback), `Stop / SessionEnd` (renamed) — and a note on the HTTP type (POST JSON, v2.1.63+). (3) `05-mcp-ecosystem.md`: Official Servers goes from 3 to 5 entries — added `git-mcp` (official Anthropic, 12 git tools) and `github-mcp` (official GitHub, full platform).

### Changed

- **`/pr-triage` skill — Phase 4 Worktree Setup** (`examples/skills/pr-triage/SKILL.md`) — porting the worktree pattern developed on Méthode Aristote to the guide's generic template. The skill goes from 3 to 4 phases: Phase 4 is opt-in, accessible from a navigation menu after Phase 1 (without going through Phase 2/3). Integrated content: 30min cache-check on Phase 1 data, automatic filtering of draft PRs and bots (Dependabot, renovate, snyk), grouped display by author, multiSelect selection via AskUserQuestion, sequential execution per PR with structured status codes (CREATED / EXISTING / FETCH_FAILED / GITIGNORE_MISSING / ALREADY_CHECKED_OUT / CREATE_FAILED), automatic `node_modules` symlink if present (Node.js), `.worktreeinclude` convention to copy local config files into each worktree, git pull `--ff-only` for existing worktrees with guided rebase fallback, final summary with next steps `cd .worktrees/<branch> && claude`. Phase 4 edge cases added (5 cases). Related table and frontmatter description updated (3-phase → 4-phase, `worktree` tag).

## [3.32.2] - 2026-03-09

### Documentation

- **Cheatsheet updated** (`guide/cheatsheet.md` + landing `cheatsheet/index.astro`) — 4 new commands from releases v2.1.59–v2.1.71: `/loop [interval] [prompt]` (recurring scheduler, e.g. `/loop 5m check the deploy`), `/stats` (usage chart + streak), `/rename [name]` (name a session), `/copy` (interactive picker to copy a code block). New shortcut `Ctrl+F` (kills all background agents, double press). `/loop` added to "Hidden Features" with version v2.1.71. Landing version synced 3.29.2 → 3.32.0.

## [3.32.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`auto-rename-session.sh` hook template** (`examples/hooks/bash/auto-rename-session.sh`) — SessionEnd hook that automatically generates a descriptive title for each session. Reads the session JSONL directly, extracts the first 3 user messages, calls `claude -p --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` to generate a 4-6 word title (`verb + subject` format), falls back to the cleaned first message if Haiku is unavailable. Updates the slug in the native JSONL (for `/resume`) and in `sessions-index.jsonl`. Output via `/dev/tty` to bypass Claude Code's JSON parsing.

### Documentation

- **"Session Auto-Rename" section updated** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`) — now presents two complementary approaches: Approach A (CLAUDE.md instruction, mid-session renaming via `/rename`, zero tooling) and Approach B (SessionEnd hook, title generated by Haiku post-session, direct JSONL reading). Removed the "Why not a hook?" paragraph which was incorrect since the introduction of session data access via JSONL.

## [3.32.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Plan-Validate-Execute Pipeline** (`guide/workflows/plan-pipeline.md`) — new complete 3-command workflow for AI-first teams: `/plan-start` (5 phases: PRD analysis, design, technical decisions, dynamic research team, metrics), `/plan-validate` (2 layers: inline structural checks + specialist agents triggered by triggers), `/plan-execute` (isolated worktree, TDD scaffolding, parallel execution by levels, quality gate with smoke test, PR creation and merge, cleanup). Includes: "non-prescriptive" philosophy (say what, never how), first principles "No Bandaids, No Workarounds" (state-of-the-art always, build time irrelevant, zero workaround), ADR learning loop (Watching → Emerging → Confirmed → CLAUDE.md promotion), CLAUDE.md discipline (120-line limit, pointer strategy to sub-files, dynamic loading), context management (`/clear` between each command). Cost profile: $2-10 for a typical Tier 2 feature with compounding over time.

- **`/plan-start` command** (`examples/commands/plan-start.md`) — 5-phase slash command with dynamic agent pool (12 roles, trigger-based selection). Includes: interactive PRD analysis with 3 buckets (missing/ambiguous/compliance), design analysis (screen inventory, states catalog, animation specs, ARIA accessibility), technical analysis with automatic resolution of ADR-confirmed decisions, scope assessment (Tier 0 Solo → Tier 4 Full Spectrum), parallel multi-agent research monitored via TaskOutput, synthesis by `planning-coordinator`, commit plan + ADRs + metrics. Auto-transition to `/plan-validate` if no ambiguities.

- **`/plan-validate` command** (`examples/commands/plan-validate.md`) — independent validation in 2 layers. Layer 1 inline structural (format, dependencies, file existence, ADR consistency, CLAUDE.md compliance). Layer 2 specialists triggered by triggers (security-reviewer Opus, db-migration-reviewer Opus, performance-reviewer, design-system-reviewer, ux-reviewer, cross-platform-reviewer, integration-reviewer Opus — 0 to 8 agents depending on the plan). ADR-aware auto-fix phase: Bucket A (auto-resolution via ADR/PATTERNS/first principles, ~95%), Bucket B (human input → new rule → future auto-resolution). Structured persistence of issues in metrics JSON. Auto-transition to `/plan-execute` if everything auto-resolved.

- **`/plan-execute` command** (`examples/commands/plan-execute.md`) — complete execution through to merged PR. Isolated worktree → TDD scaffolding (failing tests first) → parallel execution by levels (one agent per task, commit per task) → drift detection → quality gate (lint + types + tests) → integration smoke test (probe GraphQL, scan container logs, plan-defined commands) → PRD reconciliation + plan archival → PR squash merge → post-merge metrics → worktree cleanup. Up to 3 auto-fix attempts by debug agent before human escalation.

- **`planning-coordinator` agent** (`examples/agents/planning-coordinator.md`) — Opus synthesis agent, read-only. Receives reports from all research agents, reads existing ADRs, resolves conflicts between agents (ADR precedence → agent stake → human escalation), builds the task graph (layers, TDD markers, atomic granularity), verifies plan completeness (PRD coverage, security findings addressed, acyclicity). Spawned automatically when 2+ research agents are selected. Does not research — synthesizes.

- **`integration-reviewer` agent** (`examples/agents/integration-reviewer.md`) — Opus runtime validation agent, read-only + WebFetch. Validates what compiles but fails at runtime: connection parameters (ports, protocols, hostnames across environments), async/sync consistency (missing awaits, sync call in async context), env var completeness (`.env.example`, CI/CD, k8s manifests, startup validation), API library correctness (installed version vs API used via WebFetch), OTEL pipeline (configured exporter, cross-service context propagation, sampling). Triggered in `/plan-validate` when new services, libraries, or OTEL config are in scope.

## [3.31.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Skills 2.0 — Taxonomy, Evals and Lifecycle** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §5.0, §5.X, §5.Y) — 3 new blocks: Capability Uplift vs Encoded Preference taxonomy, Skill Lifecycle (Catch Regressions + Spot Outgrowth + retirement checklist), Skill Evals (Benchmark Mode / A/B Testing / Trigger Tuning). "What Makes a Good Skill?" table enriched (Expected Lifespan column). `guide/cheatsheet.md` + `machine-readable/llms.txt` updated. 3 new landing quiz questions (019-021). Sources: ainews.com, mexc.co, claudecode.jp — March 2026.

- **Featured Community Plugins — Vitals + SE-CoVe** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §8.5) — Vitals (chopratejas/vitals, v0.1 alpha): hotspot detection using `git churn × structural complexity × coupling centrality` formula, Claude semantic diagnostics, zero dependencies. SE-CoVe (vertti/se-cove-claude-plugin, v1.1.1): 5-step Chain-of-Verification pipeline (Baseline → Planner → Executor → Synthesizer → Output), verifier without access to the initial solution. Evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/vitals-codebase-health-plugin.md` (3/5). `machine-readable/reference.yaml` entries updated.

### Documentation

- **Memory system — 3 corrections** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`): Auto-Memories version corrected (v2.1.32+ → v2.1.59+, confirmed 2026-02-26), context thresholds unified (<70% optimal / 75% auto-compact / 85% handoff / 95% force), WHAT/WHY/HOW framework added (§3.1 Minimum Viable CLAUDE.md) with Next.js example and anti-pattern "do not auto-generate your CLAUDE.md".

## [3.30.2] - 2026-03-05

### Documentation

- **Conductor section enriched** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md:376`) — section rewritten from 5 generic bullets to 6 structured subsections, verified against official changelog (conductor.build). Added: workspace status system (backlog → done, v0.35.0), Next Workspace button for agent queue navigation (v0.36.4), turn-by-turn diff viewer (v0.22.0), Manual Mode built-in editor replacing VSCode for quick edits (v0.37.0), full GitHub/CI integration details (Actions tab v0.33.2, failing CI → Claude auto-fix v0.12.0, PR workflow with `⌘⇧P`), Linear deeplinks, Codex support alongside Claude, Melty Labs attribution. Community workflow pattern added: 5+ parallel features across multiple repos, BMAD + Conductor combo for spec-driven development (user-reported, unverified claim clearly marked).

- **Claude Code Releases tracking**: Updated to v2.1.69 (from v2.1.66)
  - v2.1.69: InstructionsLoaded hook, 4 security fixes (nested skills/symlink bypass/trust dialog/sandbox), 15+ memory leak fixes, Voice STT 20 languages, ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}, /reload-plugins
  - v2.1.68: ultrathink keyword re-introduced, Opus 4.6 medium effort default, Opus 4/4.1 removed from first-party API


### Added

- **OpenClaw security hardening — personal documentation (boldguy/obsidian)** — 4 files created after security audit (score 5/10 → target 8+/10). (1) `securisation-openclaw.md`: complete 5-level guide — gateway bind loopback + 32-char token, exec allowlist + filesystem denied paths, memory-lancedb reconfigured with local Ollama (nomic-embed-text, `dimensions: 768` required because `config.ts:66-72` throws for non-OpenAI model without this field), Cloudflare Access Zero Trust on `webhook.bruniaux.com`, iMessage DM Policy (pairing or allowlist), hardened docker-compose. (2) `checklist-openclaw.md`: 5 checkable sections (pre-install, network, sandbox, memory/data, channels) + monthly monitoring. (3) `scripts/verify-openclaw-security.sh`: bash script with 8 automated checks (port binding, JSON config, Ollama, active OpenAI connections, injection session scan, built-in audit, FileVault). (4) `rapport-audit-openclaw.md`: Addendum section with additional findings (Ollama local support verified in `config.ts:10,147`, community 3-tier guide, DM Policy modes). Key audit finding: `memory-lancedb` sends embeddings to OpenAI by default — reconfigure with `baseUrl: "http://localhost:11434/v1"` + `dimensions: 768` to stay 100% local.

### Fixed

- **Remote Control §9.22 — iOS bugs documented and workarounds** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md:20075`) — troubleshooting enriched following field testing (iPhone, March 2026). Confirmed bug: QR code scan opens the Claude app but the session does not appear in the list (Research Preview, reproducible on iOS, documented by MacStories). Two reliable workarounds added: (1) `claude.ai/code` in Safari — session visible directly, (2) URL copied from terminal and pasted in Safari. Explanatory note added in troubleshooting table with MacStories reference.

### Added

- **Entire CLI enrichment (6 sections, 4 files)** — integration of production analysis issue #802 (Méthode Aristote) into the guide. Content added: (1) `guide/ops/ai-traceability.md` — complete "workflow without vs with Entire" diagram showing the 7 hooks and what they capture (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop...), actual checkpoint structure (`entire/checkpoints/v1/` with metadata.json + full.jsonl + prompt.txt + context.md), orphan branch diagram (no common ancestor = zero merge conflict), Go/No-Go table with measurable thresholds (< 10 MB/session, push < 5s, < 100 MB/week) and 2h spike commands. (2) `guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md` — Claude → Gemini agent handoffs diagram with context preservation (reasoning trace, touched files, decisions, rejected approaches), "no cold start" explanation. (3) `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md` — delta table vs existing setups (7-day JSONL vs permanent checkpoints, absent human/AI attribution vs % per line, silent handoffs vs auto-passed context). (4) `guide/security/security-hardening.md` — approval gate flow diagram (policy check → low risk auto-OK / high risk → reviewer transcript + diffs → approve/reject → immutable audit trail). Source: [github.com/methode-aristote/app/issues/802](https://github.com/methode-aristote/app/issues/802).

- **`issue-triage` skill** (`examples/skills/issue-triage/`) — 3-phase issue backlog management for maintainers: automated audit of all open issues (categorization, Jaccard duplicate detection against open + 20 recent closed, risk classification Red/Yellow/Green, staleness 30/90-day thresholds, cross-reference to open PRs), opt-in deep analysis via parallel agents (full body + comments, duplicate verification, missing-info detection, effort estimate), and validated triage actions with mandatory `AskUserQuestion` gate (comment / label / close with close-reason). Jaccard algorithm is self-contained at runtime (no external library: normalize → tokenize → set intersection/union → threshold 0.60). Cross-referenced with `/pr-triage` for PR-side backlog management.

- **`pr-triage` skill** (`examples/skills/pr-triage/`) — 3-phase PR backlog management for maintainers: automated audit of all open PRs (size classification, overlap detection, cluster analysis, staleness, CI status, PR-issue linking), opt-in deep review via parallel `code-reviewer` agents, and validated comment posting with mandatory `AskUserQuestion` gate. Stack-agnostic (Node/TS, Python, Rust, Go checklists included), cross-platform clipboard (pbcopy/xclip/wl-copy/clip.exe), and cross-referenced with `/review-pr` for single-PR use cases.

- **External Orchestration Frameworks** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, new section) — new category architecturally distinct from existing multi-instance tools (Gas Town, multiclaude). Documented distinction: launching multiple Claude Code instances in parallel vs. replacing/augmenting the internal orchestration layer with a full runtime. Two tools covered: (1) **Ruflo** (formerly claude-flow, 18.9k stars) — most adopted framework, hierarchical queen + workers swarms, 60+ specialized agents, Q-Learning router, 42+ skills, 17 hooks, SQLite persistence. Install recommendation via `npx ruflo@latest` (not curl|bash). Performance claims (84.8% SWE-Bench, 352x WASM) marked unverified, ongoing rebrand documented. (2) **Athena Flow** — different architecture (hooks → UDS → NDJSON → Node.js runtime → TUI), intercepts hook events rather than augmenting the agent layer. First workflow: autonomous Playwright E2E test builder. Status "Watch — not recommended yet" (project too recent, source audit missing). Complete evaluations: `docs/resource-evaluations/073-athena-flow-workflow-runtime.md` (2/5 Watch) and `074-ruflo-multi-agent-orchestration.md` (3/5 Pertinent).

- **For Tech Leads & Engineering Managers** (`guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md`, new §12) — dedicated section for tech leads and engineering managers, a blind spot identified through resource evaluation (Mathieu Eveillard, "Génération LLM"). The guide only covered the individual perspective; this section addresses organizational responsibility. Content: 4-week onboarding model (week 1 without AI for calibration before the tool masks gaps, validated by Create Future 2025: structured training → 14-42% → 35-65% time savings), 5 real growth metrics vs. velocity, 3 scalable mentoring models (pair rotations, 15min/week architecture hot seat, collective CLAUDE.md), AI team policy template for shared `CLAUDE.md`, 6 team-level warning signs with specific responses, quick checklist. New "Team & Organizational Research" section in sources (Create Future 2025, Stanford Digital Economy 2025, LeadDev, Stack Overflow Gen Z). Evaluation file created: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-04-eveillard-generation-llm.md`.

- **Compound Engineering patterns** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, 4 insertions) — portable patterns from Every.to's compound-engineering plugin (Kieran Klaassen, prod-tested on Cora), previously absent from the guide. (1) **Named Perspective Agents**: distinction between persona roleplay (anti-pattern, prohibited §3.x) and named perspective (DHH = fat models + thin controllers + pragmatic REST condensed into one token), with caveat on drift between Claude versions. (2) **Swarm vs Sequential**: comparison table of the two multi-agent coordination modes, decision rule (Swarm = independent + thoroughness, Teams = sequential dependencies). (3) **Skill Quality Gates**: 9-criteria checklist going beyond frontmatter validation (`/audit-agents-skills`). (4) **Brainstorm-before-planning + documentary hierarchy**: `docs/brainstorms/ → docs/plans/` workflow before coding, table of 5 directories with their distinct roles (CLAUDE.md = rules, solutions/ = solved problems, brainstorms/ = thinking, plans/ = active plans, todos/ = ephemeral tasks). Formal evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-04-compound-engineering-every-to.md` (4/5 HIGH VALUE).

- **Session Auto-Rename pattern** — behavioral instruction in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` that makes Claude automatically rename sessions after 2-3 exchanges, without any hook or script. Format `[action] [subject]` (e.g. "fix auth middleware", "refactor hook system"), max 50 chars, action verb first. Useful for finding sessions via `/resume` when multiple are running in parallel. Documented limitation: the WebStorm terminal tab cannot be renamed (ANSI sequences filtered by JetBrains). Template: `examples/claude-md/session-naming.md`. Guide: new "Session Auto-Rename" subsection in §1.3 Session Continuation. Template counter 175→176.

- **Design Reference File pattern** (`examples/claude-md/design-reference-file.md`) — field pattern from Boris Paillard / mixt.care evaluation (March 2026). Principle: keep `brand-book.html` and `ui-kit.html` at the project root as permanent context files — Claude Code reads them before any UI generation, ensuring design system consistency across sessions without re-prompting. Content: CLAUDE.md activation snippet, 4 complete prompts (brand-book with integrated WCAG, Tailwind ui-kit, WCAG 2.1 color audit + color blindness simulation, vanilla JS Intersection Observer scroll animations), palette example with CSS semantic roles (mixt.care), WCAG correction notes (e.g. copper #B87333 fails for normal text → fix to #9B5F20). Evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/075-paillard-design-system-first-website.md` (3/5).

- **Straude** (`guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`, Token & Cost Tracking section) — complete entry for straude.com, a social dashboard for tracking Claude Code usage with leaderboard and streaks. Includes: functional description, table of data transmitted to the server (costs, tokens, models, hostname), security analysis based on direct source code inspection (`npm pack straude@0.1.9`), verdict (no malware, reservations about maturity and lack of privacy policy), `--dry-run` recommendation on first use. Complete evaluation: `docs/resource-evaluations/straude-evaluation.md`. Entries added in `machine-readable/reference.yaml`.

## [3.30.1] - 2026-03-04

### Documentation

- **Claude Code Releases**: Updated tracking to v2.1.66
  - v2.1.66: Reduced spurious error logging
  - v2.1.63: HTTP hooks (POST JSON to URL), project configs shared across git worktrees, `/simplify` & `/batch` bundled commands, major memory leak wave fixed
  - v2.1.62: Prompt suggestion cache fix
  - v2.1.61: Windows config file corruption fix

### Added

- **Native LSP documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`, landing cheatsheet) — complete section on Claude Code's native LSP support (v2.0.74+, December 2025). Content: performance gain explanation (50ms vs 45s for codebase navigation, 900x), activation via `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` or `~/.claude/settings.json`, table of 11 supported languages with install commands (`tsserver`, `pylsp`, `gopls`, `rust-analyzer`, `kotlin-language-server`, `sourcekit-lsp`...), `.lsp.json` configuration for timeouts. Enriched cheatsheet: LSP line with perf stat + activation note. Sources: [aifreeapi.com/en/posts/claude-code-lsp](https://aifreeapi.com/en/posts/claude-code-lsp), Perplexity fact-check March 2026.

- **`docs/solutions/` pattern documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §CLAUDE.md as Compounding Memory) — complementary pattern to CLAUDE.md for capturing solved problems between PRs, inspired by the [Compound Engineering (Every.to)](https://every.to/guides/compound-engineering) framework. Clear distinction: CLAUDE.md = behavioral rules, `docs/solutions/` = solved problems with full context. Includes example structure with 3 illustrative files (auth, iOS StoreKit, Kotlin coroutines).

- **Voice Mode documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`, `guide/cheatsheet.md`) — native feature rolling out (~5% of Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise users). `/voice` to activate, hold `Space` to speak, release to send. Can be mixed with text input in the same prompt. Free transcription, does not count toward rate limits. 4 places updated: quick commands table §1.3, built-in commands table §6.1, voice workarounds section §11 (switching from superwhisper/MacWhisper workaround to native feature), cheatsheet (commands + shortcuts + hidden features). Source: [Charly Wargnier / LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charlywargnier_voice-mode-is-officially-coming-to-claude-ugcPost-7434514836211863552-JvKw).

- **Smart Concierge + Retex system** — porting the system developed on Méthode Aristote to this project. `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`smart-suggest.sh`) that analyzes each prompt in natural language and suggests 0 or 1 relevant tool (max 1 per prompt, silent on slash commands, dedup if the tool is already in the prompt, ROI log in `~/.claude/logs/smart-suggest.jsonl`). 22 patterns in 2 tiers adapted to this project's tools: Tier 1 discovery (retex, whitepaper-density/journalist/coherence, pdf-generator, sync, security-audit, audit-repo-docs, boldguy-linkedin-answer, guide-recap, park, update-whitepapers), Tier 2 contextual (release, changelog, version, code-reviewer, debugger, audit-agents-skills, update-threat-db, audit-prose, release-notes-generator, security-check).
- **`/retex` command** — captures lessons learned (dead ends, bugs, rollbacks) in `.claude/memories/retex-*.md` with global index `retex-index.md`. Structure: what happened, root cause, prevention rule, tags, severity, scope. Direct mode (`/retex "description"`) and interactive mode.
- **`retex-review.md` rule** — auto-loaded at each session, displays the 3 most recent retex at startup, inline contextual surfacing if a pattern matches an existing prevention rule (max 1 warning per type per session).

## [3.30.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **10 advanced patterns documented** — systematic audit of 10 patterns identified from expert practitioners, fact-checked via 9 Perplexity searches (March 2026). 5 new files created, 4 existing files enriched, 3 sections added to the main guide.

  **New files**:
  - `examples/agents/plan-challenger.md` — adversarial agent for challenging plans before implementation (+52.8% security, +80% bug detection, sources: DrillAgent/nsfocusglobal.com, milvus.io)
  - `examples/agents/adr-writer.md` — automatic ADR generation agent with C1/C2/C3 criticality matrix, `mcp-adr-analysis-server` MCP reference (tosin2013/GitHub)
  - `examples/commands/audit-codebase.md` — codebase scoring command in 7 categories (Secrets, Security, Dependencies, Structure, Tests, Imports, AI Patterns), 3 severity levels, progression plan by tiers 5→8→10 (inspired by Variant Systems open-source plugin)
  - `examples/rules/first-principles.md` — session invariants template: Contract/Working Set/Noise model, measurable thresholds ("80% minimum" > "good coverage"), context decay mitigation
  - `guide/workflows/event-driven-agents.md` — complete "event → agent" workflow: Linear-Driven Agent Loop (Galarza, Feb 2026), generic webhook pattern, events×agents table, guardrails (idempotency, rate limiting, circuit breaker)

  **Main guide modifications** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`):
  - §3.1 — new "Modular Context Architecture" subsection: CLAUDE.md-as-index (<100 lines), `paths:` frontmatter for conditional loading, 3-tier architecture root→rules/→skills/ (undocumented official feature)
  - §9.3 — new "Deployment Automation" subsection: Vercel building blocks (3 required variables), Infisical as open-source Vault alternative, deploy skill, non-negotiable guardrails (staging-first, confirmation hook, rollback)
  - §9.12 (worktrees) — new "Coordinating Parallel Worktrees: Task Dependencies" subsection: manual analysis of touched files, explicit `blockedBy`, decision matrix, `coderabbitai/git-worktree-runner` reference, clarification: auto-detection does not exist

  **Workflow modifications**:
  - `guide/workflows/iterative-refinement.md` — "Community Patterns & Known Limitations" section: Ralph Loop (nathanonn.com), Auto-Continue Skill (mcpmarket.com), Stop Hooks integration, post-3-iterations escalation strategy, caveats GitHub issues #28489 and #28843
  - `guide/workflows/agent-teams.md` — nuance of >5 agents anti-pattern: context window table 10K/50K/100K+, model-per-role (desired feature, not supported by API March 2026), Gartner 40% enterprise prediction 2026

- **SonnetPlan hack documented** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §OpusPlan Mode) — budget Sonnet→Haiku variant via `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` + `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` remap: `sonnetplan()` shell function, Plan/Act routing, unreliable self-report caveat, GitHub issue link [#9749](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9749). New template `examples/scripts/sonnetplan.sh` with installation instructions and verification note (status bar vs self-report).

- **Auto-memory documented as 3rd native memory system** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §Session vs Persistent Memory) — transition from 2 to 3 systems (session / native auto-memory / Serena MCP), new 5×4 table, dedicated "Auto-Memory (native, v2.1.59+)" section with MEMORY.md path and `/memory` management. Correction: the old description linked `/memory` to CLAUDE.md (inaccurate) and ignored the native system. "When to use which" guidance updated.
- **`/memory` and `/copy` — command descriptions updated** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §Command Reference) — `/memory`: corrected to auto-memory + MEMORY.md (v2.1.59+). `/copy`: enriched with interactive code block picker and "Always copy full response" option (v2.1.59+).

- **`/batch` highlighted** (`guide/cheatsheet.md`, `whitepapers/fr/07`, `whitepapers/fr/08`, `whitepapers/en/07`, `whitepapers/en/08`) — `/batch` = 5-30 parallel agents in isolated Git worktrees, each opens a PR.

New rows: inline autocomplete, offline/local models, best for. Factual fix: Cursor pricing corrected from "$20/month flat" → credit-based (since June 2025, $20 included + overages).

- **Subscription quotas: "Claude Code prompts / 5h" column** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §Subscription Plans & Limits) — token budgets table enriched with a practical "Claude Code prompts/5h" column: Pro ~10-40, Max 5x ~50-200, Max 20x ~200-800. Warning note completed: ~50 active windows monthly cap + sub-agents/1M context impact on consumption.

- **Resource evaluation: benchmark AI coding tools Feb 2026** (`docs/resource-evaluations/benchmark-ai-coding-tools-feb2026.md`) — evaluation of a comparative 5-tool benchmark (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Copilot Workspace), text copied without source URL. Score 3/5 (relevant, selective integration). 2 net items integrated: prompts/5h quotas + comparison table extension. 4 recommendations rejected (already covered).

- **Claude Code v2.1.63 release tracking** — `machine-readable/claude-code-releases.yaml` + `guide/core/claude-code-releases.md` updated with v2.1.61, v2.1.62, v2.1.63 (HTTP hooks, worktree config sharing, `/simplify` + `/batch` bundled commands, `ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS` env var, wave of memory leak fixes)

- **Git MCP Server + GitHub MCP Server** (`guide/ultimate-guide.md` §8.2 MCP Server Catalog) — two new servers documented in the MCP catalog:
  - **Git MCP Server** (official Anthropic, `mcp-server-git`): 12 tools for local Git operations (git_status, git_diff, git_commit, git_log, git_create_branch, etc.), `uvx` setup, multi-repo config, Git MCP vs Bash comparison, typical workflows. Status: early dev.
  - **GitHub MCP Server** (official GitHub, `github/github-mcp-server`): full GitHub platform access (Issues, PRs, Projects, Code search, Enterprise), remote MCP via `api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` (Copilot required) + self-hosted PAT-only. Documented fix for the `Incompatible auth server: does not support dynamic client registration` error: inject token via `gh auth token` + manual header in `~/.claude.json`. Expired maintenance token note included.

- **Resource evaluation: MCP servers watch** (`docs/resource-evaluations/2026-03-02-mcp-servers-veille.md`) — evaluation of a watch report on 3 MCP servers (GitHub MCP, Exa, Graphiti). Final post-challenge scores: GitHub MCP 4/5 (integrated), Exa 2/5 (rejected, unverifiable stars 220 vs claim 3.1k), Graphiti 2/5 (rejected, heavy stack, Kairn already covers the need). Git MCP 5/5 (CRITICAL, previous evaluation) integrated simultaneously.

- **MCP Server: 3 new tools** — compare_versions, get_threat/list_threats, search_examples
  - `compare_versions(from, to?)` — diff between two Claude Code CLI versions: all releases in the range, aggregated highlights, aggregated breaking changes
  - `get_threat(id)` — lookup CVE (e.g. `CVE-2025-53109`) or attack technique (e.g. `T001`) from the threat database v2.4.0
  - `list_threats(category?)` — browse the threat-db: global summary with counts (no category) or detailed list by section (`cves`, `authors`, `skills`, `techniques`, `mitigations`, `sources`)
  - `search_examples(query, limit?)` — semantic search across 175 templates by intent (e.g. `"hook lint"`, `"agent code review"`) — complementary to `get_example` (exact name) and `list_examples` (category)
  - `mcp-server/IDEAS.md` — future ideas documented: `get_quiz`, `get_methodology`, `get_workflow`, resource `diff`, prompt `security-review`
  - Total: 8 tools → 12 tools (+ 3 resources + 1 prompt)

- **Terminal Personalization Settings** — documentation `spinnerVerbs` + `spinnerTipsOverride` in `guide/ultimate-guide.md` §3.3 Settings & Permissions
  - New section "Terminal Personalization Settings" (line 4978): JSON examples for `spinnerVerbs` (replace/add mode) and `spinnerTipsOverride` (with `excludeDefault: true`)
  - `settings.json` available keys enriched: added `spinnerVerbs`, `spinnerTipsOverride`, `plansDirectory`, `enableAllProjectMcpServers`
  - Link to complete example in the guide section
  - New file `examples/config/settings-personalization.json` — 183 lines, 19 custom verbs, 113+ tips in 13 categories (Context, Shortcuts, Prompting, Models, Plan Mode, Memory, Golden Rules, MCP, Tasks, CI/CD, Cost, Debug, Remote, Worktrees, Security, Hooks, Agents, Resources)
  - `machine-readable/reference.yaml`: new entry `spinner_personalization` + line number fix `permissions_deny_tool_qualified` (4978→5008)

- **Tool-qualified deny format documentation** — new section in §3.3 Settings & Permissions (`guide/ultimate-guide.md`)
  - Permission Patterns table enriched: `Read(file_path:*.env*)`, `Edit(file_path:*.pem)`, `Write(file_path:*.key)`, `Bash(command:*rm -rf*)`
  - New section "Tool-qualified deny format" with complete example inspired by real production configs (strangebee, aristote): `Read(file_path:...)` syntax vs simple `".env"` format, glob patterns, note on known `permissions.deny` limitation (GitHub #4160)
  - Reference section §10.3 Permission Patterns updated with the 3 new lines
  - Source: comparative analysis of 3 production `.claude/` configs (StrangeBee/TheHive, Méthode Aristote, ccboard)

- **Resource evaluations** — 2 new evaluations in `docs/resource-evaluations/`
  - `069-claude-code-best-practice-repo-eval.md` — Evaluation of repo `shanraisshan/claude-code-best-practice` (score 4/5): bug fixed line 5646 (official agent fields misclassified as "community patterns"), interesting patterns identified
  - `070-claude-code-best-practice-dot-claude-eval.md` — Evaluation of `.claude/` config from the same repo (score 4/5): self-evolving agent pattern, Command→Agent→Skills architecture, `allowed-tools` wildcard scoping

### Fixed

- **MCP Server v1.0.3 — content path bug** (`mcp-server/src/lib/content.ts`)
  - ENOENT at production startup: `CONTENT_DIR` resolved `../../content` from `dist/` (2 levels), landing in `node_modules/` instead of the package root
  - Fix: `../content` (1 level) — tsup bundles everything flat in `dist/`, so 1 level is sufficient
  - Published on npm: `claude-code-ultimate-guide-mcp@1.0.3`

- **Bug line 5646 `guide/ultimate-guide.md`** — agent frontmatter fields `skills`, `background`, `isolation`, `memory` were incorrectly labeled "community patterns / not official spec". Replaced by complete official table verified against `code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents`. Fields concerned: `model`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `permissionMode`, `maxTurns`, `skills`, `mcpServers`, `hooks`, `memory`, `background`, `isolation`, `color` — all official.

### Changed

- **`ccboard/.claude/settings.json`** — added `permissions.deny` with tool-qualified format (14 rules): protection for sensitive files (`.env*`, `.pem`, `.key`, `credentials`, `secrets`) and destructive commands (`rm -rf`, force-push, reset --hard). Config went from `budget`-only to complete security config.

- **Resource Evaluation: fp.dev** (score 2/5 — watchlist)
  - fp.dev = agent-native local-first issue tracker for Claude Code (issues as git-committable `.md`, skills `/fp-plan` `/fp-implement` `/fp-review`, diff viewer)
  - Real differentiator vs Tasks API: committable issues in the repo. But insufficient adoption + Apple Silicon only + partial overlap with native Tasks API
  - File: `docs/resource-evaluations/2026-02-22-fp-dev-issue-tracker.md`
  - **Known Gap added** in `guide/ecosystem/third-party-tools.md`: "Agent-native issue tracking (markdown-based, git-committable)"
  - **Watch List**: re-evaluate when GitHub stars visible + release cadence + practitioner prod write-up

## [3.23.0] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- **Adaptive Onboarding Architecture v2.0.0** — Major redesign of interactive onboarding system addressing 8 critical gaps identified by technical-writer challenge (~2,100 lines modified, 2 validation scripts, metrics plan)
  - **Adaptive topic selection**: Each profile now has **core topics** (always shown) + **adaptive topics** (context-based via keyword triggers). Claude analyzes user messages (e.g., "I work in a team and use git") to surface relevant v3.21-3.22 content (config_hierarchy, git_mcp_guide, mcp_secrets_management, dual_instance_planning, sandbox_native_guide) based on relevance, not chronology
  - **Security-first fix**: Moved `sandbox_native_guide` from `beginner_30min` → `beginner_5min` (CRITICAL fix). New users now learn sandboxing security **BEFORE** running commands, addressing technical-writer's "security gap HIGH RISK" finding
  - **Time budget validation**: All 18 profiles validated (6-8 min/topic average), respects `topics_max` limits. Prevents overwhelming users (e.g., power_30min: 4 topics max, not 6). Addresses "time budget impossible" challenge finding
  - **New learn_security goal**: Dedicated security-focused learning path with 2 profiles (intermediate_30min, power_60min) covering sandbox_native, mcp_secrets, security_hardening, production_safety, sandbox_isolation_guide. Fills gap for security-conscious users
  - **V3.21-3.22 comprehensive coverage**: All CRITICAL (5/5) and HIGH VALUE (4/5) topics now discoverable via adaptive triggers: git_mcp_guide (v3.22.0), config_hierarchy (v3.21.0), mcp_secrets_management (v3.21.0), dual_instance_planning (v3.22.0), sandbox_native_guide (v3.21.1)
  - **Quiz integration as exit activity**: Phase 4 wrap-up now recommends quiz by profile level (beginner: 60 questions ~15 min, intermediate: 100 questions ~25 min, advanced: 97 questions ~30 min). Addresses "quiz = testing mechanism, not learning content" challenge finding. 13 new deep_dive entries for quiz system
  - **Fallback minimal by design**: Kept graceful degradation pattern (3-5 topics if fetch fails), rejected proposal to enrich fallback per technical-writer recommendation. Improved fetch reliability strategy over content expansion
  - **Portability warnings added**: Documents AskUserQuestion Claude Code-specific limitation, localization status (English only for v3.21-3.22 topics, on-the-fly translation for FR/ES with accuracy warnings), simplification steps for ChatGPT/Gemini compatibility
  - **Maintenance automation**: 2 validation scripts created
    - `validate-onboarding.sh` (6 checks): YAML syntax, deep_dive key existence, time budget compliance, topics_max constraints, question_flow completeness, version alignment with VERSION file
    - `detect-new-onboarding-topics.sh`: Scans resource evaluations for CRITICAL/HIGH VALUE topics not in any profile, run monthly to prevent future drift
  - **Version metadata system**: `onboarding_matrix_meta` section added with version tracking (v2.0.0), changelog, maintenance guidelines (review trigger: every CRITICAL/HIGH feature), automation pointer (detect-new-topics script), responsible party (quarterly reviews)
  - **Files modified**: `reference.yaml` (+150 lines: onboarding_matrix_meta, adaptive matrix, learn_security goal, quiz deep_dive entries), `onboarding-prompt.md` (+80 lines: adaptive logic Phase 1/2, learn_security in Phase 1.5, quiz recommendations Phase 4, portability warnings), `scripts/validate-onboarding.sh` (350 lines), `scripts/detect-new-onboarding-topics.sh` (200 lines), `claudedocs/adaptive-onboarding-design.md` (1,100 lines design doc with 12 sections + 2 appendices)
  - **Impact**: Adoption improvement (30% of users use onboarding → 30% now discover v3.21-3.22 features), Security enhancement (beginners learn sandbox FIRST, not eventually), Support reduction (users following updated paths avoid "Why wasn't I told about X?" issues), Maintenance automation (gap detection prevents future drift), Portability transparency (users know AskUserQuestion limitation, localization accuracy warnings)
  - **Challenge validation**: Technical-writer agent challenged initial analysis, identified 8 missing angles (severity underestimation, sandbox placement wrong, quiz integration superficial, time budget violations, fallback design misunderstanding, user flow continuity gaps, maintenance burden unquantified, metrics plan missing). All 8 addressed in v2.0.0 design
  - **Effort**: 95 min actual (85 min estimated, +10 min for comprehensive testing/localization check)
  - **Credits**: Technical-writer agent (challenge phase identifying 8 critical gaps, adaptive architecture recommendation, time budget validation requirement, quiz UX correction, fallback graceful degradation insight), user request for onboarding sync verification

  - **Key frameworks**: (1) Eiffel Tower Principle — AI tools transform what's architecturally possible (like elevators enabled Eiffel Tower shape), not just acceleration, (2) Ralph Wiggum Programming — agentic loops where engineers become architects/editors, (3) **Verification Paradox** — 99% AI success makes human vigilance fragile for 1% errors, need automated guardrails, (4) Precision as Currency — clear spec definition (WHAT/WHERE/HOW) is new engineer superpower, (5) Ambition Scaling — pursue previously impossible goals enabled by tools
  - **Production Safety Rule 7** added (`guide/security/production-safety.md:639-791`): "The Verification Paradox" — when AI reliability crosses 95%, shift from manual review to automated guardrails (tests, types, lints, CI/CD gates). Anti-patterns vs Better Approaches table, 3 implementation options (automated stack, verification contracts, pre-merge checklist), integration with Rules 2/3/6
  - **Practitioner Insight** added (`guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md:2133-2168`): Alan Engineering section after Addy Osmani, following existing format (credentials, content summary, alignment table with guide references, production-scale context). Interview mention of Stanislas Polu (Dust co-founder) citing Mirakl achievement (75% employees → agent builders)
  - **Machine-readable index** updated (`reference.yaml`): Added `practitioner_alan`, `practitioner_alan_source`, `verification_paradox`, `verification_paradox_source` entries
  - **README.md counters harmonized**: Fixed evaluation count inconsistencies (37/35/38 → 41 across 5 locations: line 18 intro, line 74 mermaid diagram, line 118 structure, line 163 features, line 427 details)
  - **Challenge phase**: Technical-writer agent reviewed 6 proposed integrations, rejected 4 (Quick Start paradigm shift, Mental Model refactoring, methodologies.md deep dive, XML Prompting precision) for dilution/duplication concerns, approved 3 (production-safety, ai-ecosystem, reference.yaml)
  - **Language note**: Original article in French, concepts and Henri Bergson quote ("L'intelligence est la faculté de fabriquer des outils à faire des outils") translated for guide
- **Multi-IDE Configuration Sync Pattern** — Documented strategies for maintaining consistent AI instructions across multiple coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) in `guide/ecosystem/ai-ecosystem.md:1256-1329`
  - **Problem statement**: Table comparing config files (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, AGENTS.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md) — without sync, each drifts independently causing inconsistent AI behavior
  - **Solution 1**: Native @import (recommended for Claude Code solo usage) — no build step, maintained by Anthropic, but Cursor doesn't support it
  - **Solution 2**: Script-based generation for multi-IDE teams — source of truth in `docs/ai-instructions/` compiled into tool-specific configs via bash/node sync scripts
  - **AGENTS.md Support Status**: Clarified Claude Code does NOT natively support AGENTS.md ([GitHub issue #6235](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6235), 171 comments, open as of Feb 2026) — workaround via symlink documented
  - **Compatibility matrix**: AGENTS.md standard supported by Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, GitHub Copilot (see [AI Coding Agents Matrix](https://coding-agents-matrix.dev))
  - **Machine-readable index**: Added `ai_ecosystem_multi_ide_sync` and `agents_md_support_status` entries to `reference.yaml`
- **Resource Evaluation: Addy Osmani LinkedIn Post** (scored 2/5, Marginal - Tracking mention only) — Post about Anthropic study (17% comprehension gap) evaluated but not integrated due to 100% overlap with primary source already documented (`docs/resource-evaluations/addy-osmani-linkedin-anthropic-study.md`)
  - **Content**: LinkedIn post (Feb 1, 2026, 246K reach) citing Shen & Tamkin 2026 study on AI-assisted learning
  - **Key claims verified**: 17% comprehension gap, 2-minute productivity gain, "thinking partner vs code vending machine" framing
  - **Overlap**: 100% with arXiv:2601.20245 already cited 3× in `guide/roles/learning-with-ai.md` (lines 114, 868, 890)
  - **Decision**: Minimal integration (1-2 line tracking mention) to document mainstream diffusion timeline without content duplication
  - **Challenge phase**: Technical-writer agent confirmed score 2/5 content but noted 3/5 ecosystem context (authority messager + diffusion milestone)
  - **New criterion documented**: "Influencer Amplification" pattern for future evaluations (reach >100K + timeline awareness)
- **Resource Evaluation: "Beyond Vibe Coding" Book** (scored 3/5, Pertinent - Minimal integration) — Comprehensive O'Reilly book by Addy Osmani evaluated for 90%+ overlap with existing guide content (`docs/resource-evaluations/beyond-vibe-coding.md`)
  - **Content**: 6-chapter book (Intro/Principles/Advanced Techniques/CLI Agents/Production/Future Trends) published 2025, paid format ($B0F6S5425Y Amazon), freemium web content at beyond.addy.ie
  - **Key frameworks**: The 70% Problem (AI accelerates 70%, final 30% needs rigor), Context Engineering as RAM metaphor, Critique-Driven Development, MCP as "USB-C for AI", Multi-Agent Orchestration
  - **Overlap analysis**: 14 aspects compared — 10/14 already covered 100% (Vibe Coding, Context Engineering, MCP, Multi-Agent, Plan Mode, TDD, Spec-First, Visual Context, Production Safety)
  - **Gap identified**: Critique-Driven Development framework not explicitly documented (conceptually covered via code review workflows), Few-Shot Prompting technique, Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework
  - **Cross-validation**: Osmani's "80% Problem" article already evaluated 3/5 (ai-ecosystem.md:2024), "Good Spec" article already integrated 4/5 (workflows/spec-first.md)
  - **Decision**: Tracking mention (3-5 lines in ai-ecosystem.md:2024) + cross-ref citations (1-2 lines in 4-5 overlapping sections) + "Context as RAM" metaphor note (methodologies.md:192)
  - **Rationale**: Book = external validation/synthesis, but guide already more comprehensive (11K lines vs paid book). Rejected full integration (paid resource, 90% duplication, 2 Osmani articles already integrated)

- **Resource Evaluation #19: dclaude** (Patrick Debois) — Dockerized Claude Code wrapper evaluated at 2/5 (Marginal). Fills a narrow gap (Linux + Docker Engine without Docker Desktop) but uses standard containers with host Docker socket mount — weaker isolation than Docker Sandboxes' microVMs. Footnote added in `guide/security/sandbox-isolation.md` Limitations subsection. (`docs/resource-evaluations/dclaude-docker-wrapper.md`)
- **Resource Evaluation #20: 10 Tips from Inside the Claude Code Team** (paddo.dev / Boris Cherny thread) — Scored 4/5 (High Value). 4 integrations in ultimate-guide.md:

Major upgrade to the session search utility (`cs`) with new features and bug fixes.

#### New Features

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Multi-word AND search** | All words must match (was broken in v1) | `cs "prisma migration"` |
| **Project filter** | Filter by project name (substring) | `cs -p myproject "bug"` |
| **Date filter** | Filter by date (today, 7d, YYYY-MM-DD) | `cs --since 7d` |
| **JSON output** | Machine-readable output for scripting | `cs --json "api" \| jq .` |
| **Timeout** | 3-second timeout prevents long searches | Automatic |
| **Clean previews** | XML tags stripped, unicode filtered | No more `<local-command-caveat>` |

#### Performance

| Operation | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Cache lookup | ~16ms |
| Index rebuild | ~6s (239 sessions) |
| Fulltext search | 3-4s (timeout-bounded) |

#### Usage Examples

```bash
cs                          # 10 most recent sessions
cs "Prisma migration"       # Multi-word AND search
cs -p MethodeAristote "api" # Filter by project + keyword
cs --since 7d               # Last 7 days
cs --since today -n 20      # Today's sessions
cs --json "test" | jq .     # JSON for scripting
```

---

## [3.6.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed - Critical Factual Corrections

Major audit identifying and correcting factual errors that could mislead users about Claude Code's actual behavior.

#### 1. `--add-dir` Flag (Wrong Description → Permissions, Not Context Loading)

**Before**: Documented as "loading directories into context" / "focused context"
**Reality**: Grants tool access to directories outside CWD (permissions only, no token impact)

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | "focused context" → "allow tool access outside CWD" |
| guide/cheatsheet.md | "Add directory" → "Allow access outside CWD" |
| machine-readable/reference.yaml | "limit loaded dirs" → "access dirs outside CWD" |
| quiz/questions/10-reference.yaml | Question + explanation corrected |

#### 2. `excludePatterns` → `permissions.deny` (Never Existed)

**Before**: Documented `excludePatterns` as a valid settings key
**Reality**: Never existed - the correct syntax is `permissions.deny`

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | New syntax + warning |
| guide/security/data-privacy.md | New syntax + deprecation note |
| examples/scripts/audit-scan.sh | Detection + message fixed |
| tools/audit-prompt.md | 3 references corrected |

#### 3. `.claudeignore` Removed (Does Not Exist)

**Before**: Documented as a file exclusion mechanism like `.gitignore`
**Reality**: Not an official feature - use `permissions.deny` instead

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | References → `permissions.deny` |
| guide/security/data-privacy.md | Section removed |
| CHANGELOG.md:1244 | Historical reference corrected |

#### 4. "Selective Context Loading" Myth → Lazy Loading Reality

**Before**: Implied Claude loads entire codebase or selectively loads directories
**Reality**: Claude uses lazy loading - reads files on-demand via Read/Grep tools

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | New section explaining lazy loading |
| guide/cheatsheet.md | "Giant context loads" → "Vague prompts" |
| machine-readable/reference.yaml | "load giant context" → "bloated CLAUDE.md" |

#### 5. Invented CLI Flags (SuperClaude Extension Confusion)

**Before**: `--think`, `--think-hard`, `--ultrathink`, `--headless`, `--learn`, `--uc`, `--web` documented as official CLI flags
**Reality**: These are SuperClaude framework extensions (prompt injection), NOT official Claude Code flags

| Correction Type | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| `--headless` | Replaced with `-p` (the actual flag for non-interactive mode) |
| `--think` variants | Clarified as "prompt keywords", not CLI flags |
| SuperClaude section | Added warning: "Non-official Extension" |
| Cheatsheet | Think flags table reformatted as prompt keywords |
| Decision tree | "Use --think" → "Use extended thinking prompts" |

#### 6. `@` File Reference Behavior

**Before**: "Claude loads file content automatically"
**After**: "Signals Claude to read files on-demand via tools"

### Added - Session Search Tool (`cs`)

**Problem solved**: After weeks of Claude Code usage, finding past conversations becomes painful:
- `claude --resume` is interactive (no search)
- Sessions accumulate in `~/.claude/projects/`
- No quick way to search "that session where I talked about auth"

**Solution**: `cs` — Zero-dependency bash script for searching and resuming sessions.

```bash
cs                    # List 10 recent sessions (15ms)
cs "authentication"   # Full-text search (400ms)
cs -n 20              # More results

# Output:
# 2026-01-15 08:32 │ my-project │ Implement OAuth flow for...
#   claude --resume 84287c0d-8778-4a8d-abf1-eb2807e327a8
```

**Performance comparison**:

| Tool | List | Search | Deps | Resume cmd |
|------|------|--------|------|------------|
| `cs` (this script) | 15ms | 400ms | None | ✅ Shown |
| claude-conversation-extractor | 230ms | 1.7s | Python | ❌ |
| `claude --resume` native | 500ms+ | ❌ | None | Interactive |

**Files created/modified**:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `examples/scripts/session-search.sh` | Script in repo (source) |
| `examples/README.md` | Entry in Scripts table |
| `guide/ops/observability.md` | Section "Session Search & Resume" |
| `guide/ultimate-guide.md:505-524` | Examples in "Finding session IDs" |
| `README.md:398-403` | Section "Utility Scripts" |
| `machine-readable/reference.yaml` | `deep_dive.session_search` entry |

**Installation** (local):
```bash
# Copy script
cp examples/scripts/session-search.sh ~/.claude/scripts/cs
chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/cs

# Add alias to shell
echo 'alias cs="~/.claude/scripts/cs"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Added - Security Documentation

| File | Addition |
|------|----------|
| guide/security/security-hardening.md | Section 1.2 "Known Limitations of permissions.deny" |

**Content**:
- Blocking matrix (Read/Edit/Write/Bash)
- Security gaps documented (GitHub #4160)
- Recommended exhaustive config
- Defense-in-depth strategy

### Files Modified (15 total)

```

### Root Cause Analysis

The factual errors originated from:
1. **SuperClaude framework confusion**: User had `~/.claude/FLAGS.md` with custom flags that were documented as if official
2. **Assumption propagation**: "selective loading" concept was assumed from other AI tools
3. **Outdated syntax**: `excludePatterns` may have been planned but never implemented

## [2.9.0] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **MCP detection bug in audit-scan.sh** (~60 lines modified)
  - **Root cause**: Script searched for `~/.claude/mcp.json` which doesn't exist
  - **Actual location**: Claude Code stores MCP config in `~/.claude.json` under `projects.<path>.mcpServers`
  - **Solution**: Multi-source detection with priority:
    1. `~/.claude.json` → `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` (most common)
    2. `./.claude/mcp.json` (project-level)
    3. `~/.claude/mcp.json` (legacy global)
  - JSON output now includes detailed `mcp` section (configured, count, servers, source)
  - Human output shows server count and source location
- **Bug `0\n0` in `claude_md_refs`** (~8 lines)
  - **Root cause**: `grep -c ... || echo "0"` could produce double output
  - **Solution**: Rewritten `count_pattern()` function to properly capture and return count

### Changed
- **audit-scan.sh** enhanced (~50 lines)
  - Added `MCP_SOURCE` variable to track where MCP config was found
  - Added `MCP_COUNT` variable for server count
  - Global `mcp.json` message changed from error to info (not required)
  - JSON output restructured with separate `mcp` object

  - Phase 1.2: Complete MCP detection rewrite covering all 3 locations
  - Glossary: Updated MCP definition to explain config locations
  - Version: 2.8 → 2.9

### Stats
- 2 files modified (audit-scan.sh, claude-setup-audit-prompt.md)
- Bug impact: Scripts now correctly detect MCP servers (was showing "No MCP" even when configured)
- Tested: Verified on Méthode Aristote project with 9 MCP servers
