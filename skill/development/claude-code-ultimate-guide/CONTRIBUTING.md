## Pull Request Process

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-ultimate-guide.git
cd claude-code-ultimate-guide
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b fix/typo-in-section-3
# or
git checkout -b feature/add-debugging-guide
```

### 2.5. Install Pre-commit Hooks

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to enforce quality gates (markdown lint, YAML validation, version consistency, etc.). Set them up once:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Windows (PowerShell)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Pre-commit will now run automatically on `git commit`. You can also run manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**What the hooks check:**
- ✓ Markdown formatting consistency
- ✓ YAML syntax validity
- ✓ VERSION file consistency across the repo
- ✓ No broken symlinks or sensitive files

### 4. Test Your Changes

- Preview markdown rendering

- Verify all links work
