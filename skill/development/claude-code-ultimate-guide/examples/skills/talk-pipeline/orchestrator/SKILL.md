# Talk Pipeline Orchestrator

Orchestrates the complete talk preparation pipeline from raw material to revision sheets. Can run the full pipeline or a single isolated stage.

## Modes

- `--rex`: REX talk with git/code proof (changelog, commits, measured metrics)
- `--concept`: Conceptual talk from article, ideas, notes (skips Stage 2)

## Usage

```
/talk-pipeline                          # full pipeline, asks for context
/talk-pipeline --stage=extract          # run a single isolated stage
/talk-pipeline --rex                    # REX mode (git archaeology included)
/talk-pipeline --concept                # Concept mode (skip research)
/talk-pipeline --rex --slug=my-talk --event="Conf 2026" --date=2026-06-15 --duration=30
```

## Context Collection

Ask with AskUserQuestion if not provided:

```
- slug         : kebab-case identifier (e.g., my-talk-topic)
- event        : event name (e.g., Conf 2026, Tech Meetup)
- date         : talk date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- duration     : duration in minutes (e.g., 30)
- audience     : audience profile (e.g., senior devs, tech leads, non-tech)
- type         : --rex or --concept
- source_path  : path to source material (article .mdx, transcript .md, notes)
- repo_path    : (REX only) path to git repository for archaeology
```

## Workflow

1. **Collect context** using AskUserQuestion for required metadata
2. **Route by mode** (`--rex` vs `--concept`, skip Stage 2 if concept)
3. **Run Stage 1** (`/talk-stage1-extract`, always first)
4. **Run Stages 2-4 in parallel** (after Stage 1 confirmed)
   - REX: extract -> research + concepts + position (in parallel)
   - Concept: extract -> concepts + position (in parallel, skip research)
5. **CHECKPOINT**: wait for angle + title choice (Stage 4 output)
6. **Run Stage 5** (`/talk-stage5-script` with validated choice)
7. **Run Stage 6** (`/talk-stage6-revision`)
8. **Final summary**: list all generated files with their paths

## Dependency Graph

```
         extract (Stage 1)
               |
    +----------+-----------+
    v          v           v
research    concepts   position
(Stage 2)   (Stage 3)  (Stage 4)
[--rex only]            [CHECKPOINT]
    |          |           |
    +----------+-----------+
               v
          script (Stage 5)
               |
               v
         revision (Stage 6)
```

## Stage Routing (--stage=X)

If `--stage` is provided, run only the corresponding skill:

| Stage | Skill to invoke |
|-------|----------------|
| extract | /talk-stage1-extract |
| research | /talk-stage2-research |
| concepts | /talk-stage3-concepts |
| position | /talk-stage4-position |
| script | /talk-stage5-script |
| revision | /talk-stage6-revision |

## Output Naming Convention

```
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-summary.md           # extract
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-git-archaeology.md   # research
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-changelog-analysis.md
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-timeline.md
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-concepts.md          # concepts
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-concepts-enriched.md
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-angles.md            # position
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-titre.md
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-descriptions.md
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-feedback-draft.md
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-pitch.md             # script
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-slides.md
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-kimi-prompt.md
talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-revision-sheets.md   # revision
```

## Final Summary Format

After Stage 6 completes, display:

```
Pipeline complete. Files generated:

Stage 1: Extract
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-summary.md

Stage 2: Research (REX only)
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-git-archaeology.md
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-changelog-analysis.md
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-timeline.md

Stage 3: Concepts
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-concepts.md
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-concepts-enriched.md (if repo available)

Stage 4: Position
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-angles.md
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-titre.md
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-descriptions.md
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-feedback-draft.md

Stage 5: Script
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-pitch.md
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-slides.md
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-kimi-prompt.md   <- copy-paste into kimi.com

Stage 6: Revision
  v talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-revision-sheets.md

Next step: open kimi-prompt.md, verify no {PLACEHOLDER} remains, paste into kimi.com.
```

## Anti-patterns

- Do not run Stage 5 without an explicit angle + title choice from the user
- Do not run Stage 2 (research) in `--concept` mode
- Do not proceed to the next stage if an upstream stage failed
- Do not invent metrics or dates not present in the source material

## Validation

- [ ] All upstream files exist before launching a downstream stage
- [ ] Stage 4 CHECKPOINT respected before script
- [ ] Outputs named per convention `talks/{YYYY}-{slug}-{stage}.md`
- [ ] No empty placeholders in generated files

## Tips

- The orchestrator is the recommended entry point for first use
- For repeat users who know the pipeline, running individual stage skills is faster
- The `--stage=X` flag is useful for rerunning a single stage without redoing the full pipeline
