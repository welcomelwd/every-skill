# Teach Me

Step-by-step explanation of a concept with progressive depth.

## Usage

```
/learn:teach React hooks         # Learn about React hooks
/learn:teach async/await         # Understand async patterns
/learn:teach SOLID principles    # Learn design principles
/learn:teach --deep SQL joins    # In-depth explanation
```

## Instructions

1. Start with a **one-sentence definition** of the concept
2. Explain **why it matters** (real-world problem it solves)
3. Show a **minimal example** (simplest possible code)
4. Break down **each part** of the example with comments
5. Show a **practical example** (real-world use case)
6. Highlight **common mistakes** beginners make
7. Suggest **next concepts** to learn

## Response Format

```markdown
## [Concept Name]

**In one sentence**: [Clear, simple definition]

### Why It Matters

[1-2 sentences on the problem this solves]

### Minimal Example

\`\`\`[language]
// Simplest possible demonstration
[code]
\`\`\`

**Line by line**:
- Line 1: [explanation]
- Line 2: [explanation]
...

### Practical Example

\`\`\`[language]
// Real-world scenario
[code]
\`\`\`

### Common Mistakes

1. **[Mistake]**: [Why it's wrong and what to do instead]
2. **[Mistake]**: [Why it's wrong and what to do instead]

### Key Takeaways

- [Bullet point 1]
- [Bullet point 2]
- [Bullet point 3]

### Learn Next

- [Related concept 1]: [why it connects]
- [Related concept 2]: [why it connects]

**Practice challenge**: [Small exercise to reinforce the concept]
```

## Depth Modes

### Default
- One-sentence definition
- One minimal example
- One practical example
- 2-3 common mistakes

### `--deep`
- Extended explanation with history/context
- Multiple examples of increasing complexity
- Edge cases and gotchas
- Performance considerations
- Comparison with alternatives
- Interview-relevant details

### `--quick`
- Definition only
- Single example
- No extras

## Adaptation Rules

### For Beginners
- Use analogies from everyday life
- Avoid jargon (or explain it immediately)
- More comments in code
- Smaller code examples

### For Intermediates
- Assume basic syntax knowledge
- Focus on "why" over "what"
- Include trade-offs
- Show idiomatic patterns

### For Advanced Topics
- Reference official documentation
- Discuss internal implementation when relevant
- Include performance implications
- Mention related patterns

## Example Session

```
User: /learn:teach useEffect

Claude: ## useEffect

**In one sentence**: useEffect lets you run side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, DOM changes) after React renders a component.

### Why It Matters

React components are pure functions that render UI. But real apps need to interact with the outside world: APIs, browser events, timers. useEffect is the bridge between React's declarative world and imperative side effects.

### Minimal Example

\`\`\`jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds(s => s + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(id);  // Cleanup
  }, []);  // Empty array = run once

  return <div>{seconds}s</div>;
}
\`\`\`

**Line by line**:
- `useEffect(() => {...}, [])`: Run this function after first render
- `setInterval(...)`: Start a timer (side effect)
- `return () => clearInterval(id)`: Cleanup when component unmounts
- `[]`: Empty dependency array = only run on mount

### Common Mistakes

1. **Missing dependency array**: Without `[]`, effect runs on EVERY render
2. **Forgetting cleanup**: Intervals/subscriptions leak without return function
3. **Stale closures**: Using old state values instead of functional updates

---

**Practice challenge**: Add a pause button that stops and resumes the timer.
