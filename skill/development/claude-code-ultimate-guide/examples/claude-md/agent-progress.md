# Session Progress

<!--
agent-progress.md — Session handoff template for harness engineering.
Written at the end of every session, read at the start of the next.
Keep it short and concrete. The "Notes for Next Session" section is
the highest-ROI part: file paths and line numbers save 5-10 minutes
of orientation at session start.

src/services/DocumentService.import() at line 67. It expects a
ChunkResult[] type defined in src/types/documents.ts:18."
