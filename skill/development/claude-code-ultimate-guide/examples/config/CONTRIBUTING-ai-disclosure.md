## AI Assistance Disclosure

If you use any AI tools to help with your contribution, please disclose this
in your pull request description.

### What to Disclose

| AI Usage | Example Disclosure |
|----------|-------------------|
| **AI-generated code** | "This PR was written primarily by Claude Code" |
| **AI-assisted research** | "I consulted ChatGPT to understand the codebase" |
| **AI-suggested approach** | "Copilot suggested the algorithm structure" |
| **AI-drafted docs** | "Documentation was drafted with Claude assistance" |

### What Doesn't Need Disclosure

- Trivial autocomplete (single keywords, short phrases)
- IDE syntax helpers (formatting, auto-imports)
- Grammar/spell checking
- Code formatting tools (prettier, black)

### Why We Ask

AI-generated code often requires more careful review:

- May use patterns unfamiliar to the codebase
- Could introduce subtle bugs humans wouldn't make
- Might miss project-specific conventions
- Sometimes "looks right" but has logical issues

Disclosure helps maintainers:
- Allocate review time appropriately
- Know where to look more carefully
- Provide better feedback on AI usage

This is a **courtesy to reviewers**, not a judgment on AI use.

### Suggested Disclosure Format

In your PR description:

```markdown
## AI Assistance

This PR was developed with assistance from [Tool Name].
Specifically:
- [What AI helped with]
- [What you did manually]

All code has been reviewed and understood by the author.
```
