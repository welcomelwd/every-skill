# --- PWF_PLAN_ROOT: absolute plan-root binding (issue #212). ---
# A thread whose cwd is a shared PARENT of the real project can be pinned to
# the nested project root; every planning-state read below goes through the
# prefix. An explicit but broken pin fails CLOSED: one notice, nothing
# injected, never a silent fall back to the ambiguous cwd plan the caller was
# escaping. With the var unset the paths stay byte-identical to the legacy
# shape. Wording matches scripts/inject-plan.sh and the sh twin.
