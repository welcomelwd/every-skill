## Checklist

- [ ] This implements an issue that a maintainer agreed to
- [ ] `npx nx affected -t lint test build --base=origin/main` passes locally
- [ ] Conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
- [ ] For a new or changed skill: the `description` follows `[What it does] + [Use when ...] + [Do NOT use for ...]`, and `npm run validate` passes
- [ ] For bundled skill files: `references/`, `scripts/` or `assets/` unless there is a reason to differ
- [ ] An AI agent was involved, and I reviewed every line — or no agent was involved
