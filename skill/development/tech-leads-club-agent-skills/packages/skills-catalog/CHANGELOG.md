- **skills-catalog:** promote tlc-spec-driven to v3, retire megabrain alias  ([9b3ec067a](https://github.com/tech-leads-club/agent-skills/commit/9b3ec067a))
  The megabrain skill is removed (use tlc-spec-driven).
  tlc-spec-driven v3 removes Quick mode, brownfield mapping, the
  project/roadmap/state-handoff layer, and test-first RED/GREEN; .specs/
  is now STATE.md + LESSONS.md/lessons.json + features/ with per-feature
  validation.md. Triggers removed: map codebase, quick fix, quick task;
  added: record decision, pause work, resume work, load/record lessons.
