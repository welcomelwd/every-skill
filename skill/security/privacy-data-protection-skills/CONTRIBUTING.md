# Contributing to Privacy & Data Protection Skills

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open-source privacy and data protection skills database. This guide explains how to submit new skills, improve existing ones, and maintain quality standards.

## Contributing Without Code

You do not need to be a developer to contribute. DPOs, privacy lawyers, GRC analysts, and compliance professionals are the domain experts this project needs most.

**Option 1: GitHub Issue Templates**
- [Request a new skill](../../issues/new?template=new-skill-request.md) — describe the privacy workflow and regulatory basis
- [Suggest improvements](../../issues/new?template=skill-improvement.md) — flag inaccuracies or missing coverage

**Option 2: Plain Language Description**
Open a GitHub Issue with the title "[Skill Suggestion] Your Skill Name" and describe:
1. What privacy task this skill should help AI agents perform
2. Which regulation(s) it relates to (article/section numbers if known)
3. The step-by-step workflow a privacy professional would follow
4. Any enforcement precedents or regulatory guidance

Maintainers will convert your description into the agentskills.io format. You will be credited as a contributor.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Privacy-Data-Protection-Skills.git
cd Privacy-Data-Protection-Skills
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-skill-name
```

Branch naming convention:
- `feat/skill-name` for new skills
- `fix/skill-name` for corrections to existing skills
- `docs/topic` for documentation changes

### 3. Create Your Skill

Each skill lives in its own directory under `skills/privacy/`:

```
skills/privacy/your-skill-name/
  SKILL.md
  references/
    standards.md
    workflows.md
  scripts/
    process.py
  assets/
    template.md
```

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

```bash
git add skills/privacy/your-skill-name/
git commit -m "feat: add your-skill-name skill"
git push origin feat/your-skill-name
```

Open a pull request against the `main` branch with a clear description of the skill and its regulatory basis.

## Skill Format (agentskills.io Standard)

Every `SKILL.md` must begin with YAML frontmatter following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard:

```yaml

  and which regulatory provisions it covers. Include relevant keywords for
  discovery. Maximum 1024 characters.

metadata:
  author: your-github-username
  version: "1.0"
  domain: privacy
  subdomain: one-of-twenty-subdomains
  tags: "comma, separated, relevant, tags"

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting your pull request, verify:

- [ ] `name` in frontmatter matches the parent directory name exactly
- [ ] `description` is under 1024 characters
- [ ] `SKILL.md` body is under 500 lines
- [ ] `references/standards.md` contains 2+ real regulatory citations
- [ ] `references/workflows.md` has numbered procedural steps
- [ ] `scripts/process.py` passes `python3 -m py_compile`

- [ ] Enforcement precedents include real case references and fine amounts

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks**: GitHub Actions validates frontmatter, Python syntax, and placeholder detection
2. **Maintainer review**: A maintainer reviews regulatory accuracy and skill quality
3. **Merge**: Approved PRs are merged to `main` and included in the next release

Reviews typically complete within 5 business days. Maintainers may request changes for regulatory accuracy, formatting consistency, or quality improvements.

## Reporting Issues

- **Regulatory errors**: Open an issue with the `regulatory-accuracy` label
- **Missing skills**: Use the "New Skill Request" issue template
- **Improvements**: Use the "Skill Improvement" issue template
- **Bugs**: Use the "Bug Report" issue template
