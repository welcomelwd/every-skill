# Retention Impact Assessment

## Overview

A Retention Impact Assessment (RIA) is a structured evaluation conducted before commencing new processing activities (or significantly changing existing ones) to determine the appropriate retention period for personal data. The RIA ensures that retention periods are set proactively — by design — rather than retroactively after data has accumulated without defined limits. Under GDPR Article 25, data protection by design requires that storage limitation is considered at the design stage of any processing activity. This skill provides the assessment methodology, regulatory scanning framework, proportionality analysis, and documentation template for determining and justifying retention periods.

## Legal Foundation

### GDPR Article 5(1)(e) — Storage Limitation

Personal data shall be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.

### GDPR Article 25 — Data Protection by Design and by Default

The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing. This includes proactive determination of retention periods before processing begins.

### GDPR Article 35(7)(d) — DPIA Content

Where a Data Protection Impact Assessment is required, it must include the envisaged processing operations and the purposes, including where applicable the legitimate interest pursued (Art. 35(7)(a)), and an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations (Art. 35(7)(b)). Retention period determination is a core element of the necessity and proportionality assessment.

### GDPR Article 13(2)(a) and Article 14(2)(a) — Transparency

Data subjects must be informed of the period for which personal data will be stored, or the criteria used to determine that period. The RIA produces this information.

## When to Conduct a Retention Impact Assessment

### Mandatory Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **New processing activity** | Any new processing activity involving personal data that is not covered by an existing retention schedule entry |
| **New system/application** | Deployment of a new system, application, or database that will store personal data |
| **Significant change to existing processing** | Change in purpose, scope, data categories, or technology that materially affects the retention profile |
| **New legal/regulatory requirement** | New legislation or regulatory guidance that introduces or modifies retention requirements |
| **Post-breach recommendation** | Following a data breach where excessive retention was identified as a contributing factor |
| **DPIA finding** | Where a DPIA identifies retention period determination as an outstanding action |
| **Vendor/processor change** | Onboarding a new processor or service provider that will store personal data on behalf of the organization |

### Phase 2: Regulatory Requirements Scan

Systematically identify all legal and regulatory requirements that mandate minimum retention:

#### Regulatory Scan Checklist

#### Jurisdictional Scan (for International Processing)

| Jurisdiction | Applicable Law | Retention Requirement | Conflict with Primary? |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| UK | [Applicable UK statutes] | [Period] | N/A (primary jurisdiction) |
| EU Member State(s) | [Applicable EU/MS law] | [Period] | [Yes/No — resolve by applying longest] |
| US (if applicable) | [SOX, CCPA, state law] | [Period] | [Yes/No — resolve] |
| Other | [Specify] | [Period] | [Yes/No — resolve] |

### Phase 3: Purpose-Based Retention Determination

For each processing purpose, determine the retention period independently:

```
PURPOSE-BASED RETENTION ANALYSIS
---------------------------------

Purpose 1: [Primary processing purpose]
- Legal basis: [Art. 6(1)(x)]
- Data categories needed: [List]
- Duration of purpose: [How long does this purpose persist?]
- Retention period for this purpose: [Duration]
- Justification: [Why this period is necessary and proportionate]

Purpose 2: [Secondary processing purpose — if any]
- Legal basis: [Art. 6(1)(x)]
- Data categories needed: [List — should be subset of or equal to Purpose 1]
- Duration of purpose: [How long does this purpose persist?]
- Retention period for this purpose: [Duration]
- Justification: [Why this period is necessary and proportionate]

Statutory Override (if applicable):
- Statute: [Citation]
- Mandatory minimum: [Period]
- This overrides Purpose [X] period: [Yes/No]

RESULTING RETENTION PERIOD: [The longest justified period across all purposes
and statutory requirements, but no longer than the maximum necessary period]
```

### Phase 4: Proportionality Review

The proportionality assessment ensures the retention period is no longer than necessary:

```
PROPORTIONALITY ASSESSMENT
----------------------------

1. NECESSITY
   - Is the proposed retention period the minimum necessary to achieve
     the stated purpose(s)? [Yes/No — justify]
   - Could the purpose be achieved with a shorter retention period?
     [Yes/No — justify]
   - Could the purpose be achieved with anonymized or aggregated data
     after a shorter period of identifiable retention? [Yes/No — justify]

2. DATA MINIMIZATION OVER TIME
   - Can some data elements be deleted or anonymized before the full
     retention period expires? [Yes/No — if yes, specify staged deletion]
   - Example: Full data retained for 12 months for service delivery;
     anonymized to aggregate statistics at 12 months; aggregates retained
     for 3 years for trend analysis.

3. ACCESS RESTRICTION OVER TIME
   - Should access be progressively restricted as the data ages?
   - Example: Active access for first 12 months; restricted to compliance
     team only for months 13-72; automated deletion at month 72.

4. RISK TO DATA SUBJECTS
   - What is the risk to data subjects from the proposed retention?
     [Low/Medium/High — justify]
   - Does longer retention increase breach impact? [Yes/No]
   - Are there specific data subject groups requiring heightened protection?
     (e.g., children, vulnerable individuals)

5. ALTERNATIVES TO RETENTION
   - Has anonymization been considered as an alternative? [Yes/No — outcome]
   - Has pseudonymization been considered to reduce risk during retention?
     [Yes/No — outcome]
   - Has data aggregation been considered? [Yes/No — outcome]

PROPORTIONALITY CONCLUSION:
The proposed retention period of [X] is / is not proportionate because:
[Detailed justification — 2-3 paragraphs]
