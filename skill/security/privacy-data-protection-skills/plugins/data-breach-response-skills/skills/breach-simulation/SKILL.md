# Designing Breach Simulation Exercise

## Overview

Breach simulation exercises (tabletop exercises) test an organization's ability to detect, respond to, and recover from a personal data breach without the consequences of an actual incident. A well-designed exercise validates the breach response plan, identifies gaps in procedures, communication, and decision-making, and builds institutional muscle memory. This skill covers the end-to-end design process from scenario creation through after-action reporting.

## Exercise Design Framework

### Exercise Types

| Type | Duration | Participants | Complexity | Purpose |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Tabletop (discussion-based) | 2-4 hours | 8-15 senior stakeholders | Medium | Test decision-making, communication, and policy application |
| Functional exercise | 4-8 hours | 15-30 cross-functional team members | High | Test operational procedures and tool usage |
| Full-scale simulation | 1-3 days | Organization-wide (50+ participants) | Very high | Test end-to-end response including technical, legal, communications, and executive functions |

### Recommended Exercise Cadence

| Exercise Type | Frequency | Audience |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Tabletop | Semi-annually | Executive team, DPO, legal, communications, CISO |
| Functional | Annually | SOC, privacy team, IT operations, HR, customer service |
| Full-scale | Every 2 years | Organization-wide |

## Scenario Design

### Scenario 1: Ransomware Attack on Customer Database

**Complexity**: High
**Duration**: 3 hours
**Primary objectives**: Test Art. 33 72-hour notification decision-making, executive communication, and vendor coordination.

**Background briefing (distributed 24 hours before exercise):**
Stellar Payments Group processes payment transactions for 15,230 account holders across 18 EU member states and 12 US states. The production customer database is hosted on a PostgreSQL cluster in AWS eu-west-1. The DPO is Dr. Elena Vasquez. The CISO is Thomas Brenner. Mandiant is the retained incident response firm.

**Inject timeline:**

| Time | Inject | Expected Action |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| T+0 min | SOC alert: CrowdStrike detects rapid file encryption on db-prod-eu-west-01. 500+ file renames per second. Known ransomware indicators (LockBit 3.0). | SOC initiates incident response. Incident Commander activated. |
| T+15 min | Update: Encryption spreading to db-prod-eu-west-02 and 03. Customer portal returning database errors. Customer complaints arriving via support channels. | Decision point: Isolate database cluster? Accept service disruption vs. further damage? |
| T+30 min | Forensic initial finding: Attack vector appears to be compromised service account (svc-migration-2024). Account authenticated from Tor exit node 3 days prior. | Update risk assessment. Determine scope of potentially compromised data. |
| T+60 min | Customer database confirmed encrypted. 48,720 records across 15,230 data subjects. Backup from 12 hours ago available and verified clean. | Decision point: Restore from backup? Art. 33 notification clock — when did we "become aware"? |
| T+90 min | Ransom note found: 50 BTC demanded. Threat to publish data on dark web if not paid within 48 hours. Media outlet (Handelsblatt) calls communications team for comment. | Decision points: Pay ransom? Engage law enforcement? Media statement? |
| T+120 min | Mandiant confirms no evidence of exfiltration but cannot rule it out. Backup restoration is 60% complete. Berliner BfDI opens office in 2 hours. | Decision point: File Art. 33 notification now or wait for more information? Prepare Art. 34 data subject notification? |
| T+150 min | Second media outlet (Bloomberg) publishes story. Social media discussion begins. 50+ customer support calls in past hour. Three enterprise clients demand written assurance. | Communications crisis management. Customer and B2B stakeholder communication. |
| T+180 min | Exercise conclusion. Facilitator reveals exercise end state and leads debrief discussion. | After-action discussion. |

### Scenario 2: Insider Threat — Employee Data Exfiltration

**Complexity**: Medium
**Duration**: 2.5 hours

**Inject timeline:**

| Time | Inject | Expected Action |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| T+0 min | DLP alert: HR database export (3,400 employee records) copied to personal OneDrive by departing employee (last day is Friday). | Validate alert. Determine whether personal data is involved. |
| T+20 min | Records include names, home addresses, salaries, bank details, and national ID numbers. Employee's manager confirms the employee submitted resignation 2 weeks ago. | Decision point: Confront employee? Preserve evidence? Involve legal? |
| T+45 min | IT confirms the file was synced to the employee's personal laptop. The employee is currently in the office. | Decision points: Device seizure? HR involvement? Works Council (Betriebsrat) notification? |
| T+75 min | Legal advises on employee rights under German labor law. Works Council representative requests consultation before any confrontation. | Balance breach response urgency against employee rights and Works Council obligations. |
| T+105 min | Employee is interviewed with Works Council representative present. Claims data was for "reference purposes." Refuses to allow personal laptop examination. | Decision point: Law enforcement referral? Court order for device examination? Art. 33 notification? |
| T+135 min | DPO completes risk assessment: 3,400 employees, government IDs + financial data = high risk. Art. 33 and Art. 34 notification recommended. | Notification preparation. Employee communication planning (how to tell 3,400 employees their data was compromised by a colleague). |
| T+150 min | Exercise conclusion and debrief. | After-action discussion. |

### Scenario 3: Third-Party Processor Breach

**Complexity**: Medium
**Duration**: 2 hours

**Inject timeline:**

| Time | Inject | Expected Action |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| T+0 min | Email from cloud payroll processor (PayrollCloud GmbH): "We are writing to inform you of a security incident affecting customer data hosted on our platform." No details provided. | Contact processor for details. Review Art. 28 DPA for incident notification obligations. |
| T+20 min | Processor confirms: SQL injection attack. Unclear which clients affected. Estimated timeline for client-specific impact assessment: 5-7 days. | Decision point: Can we wait 5-7 days? How does this affect our 72-hour clock? |
| T+45 min | Processor provides partial information: "Your organization's data was on the affected server, but we cannot confirm whether it was accessed." 3,400 employee payroll records potentially exposed. | Assess when the controller "became aware" for Art. 33 purposes. Begin parallel risk assessment. |
| T+75 min | Media reports the processor breach. Several of the processor's other clients have publicly acknowledged being affected. | Decision point: Proactive disclosure? Wait for confirmed impact? |
| T+105 min | Processor confirms: Stellar Payments Group data was accessed. 3,400 employee records including names, salaries, bank account numbers, and tax IDs. | Art. 33 notification preparation. Employee communication planning. Processor accountability assessment. |
| T+120 min | Exercise conclusion and debrief. | After-action discussion. |

## Participant Roles

| Role | Participant | Responsibilities During Exercise |
|------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Incident Commander | CISO (Thomas Brenner) | Overall incident coordination, resource allocation, containment decisions |
| Privacy Lead | DPO (Dr. Elena Vasquez) | Notification decisions, risk assessment, data subject communication |
| Legal Counsel | General Counsel (Sarah Chen) | Legal advice, privilege management, law enforcement coordination, regulatory strategy |
| Communications Lead | Communications Director (Martin Keller) | Media response, customer communication, internal communication |

| Exercise Facilitator | External consultant or internal audit | Scenario delivery, inject timing, discussion facilitation, observation |
| Observer/Recorder | DPO office analyst | Document decisions, actions, timelines, and gaps for after-action report |

## Decision Points to Evaluate

1. **Breach awareness determination**: When exactly did the controller "become aware" for Art. 33 clock purposes?
2. **Containment vs. evidence preservation**: Did the team balance immediate containment with the need to preserve forensic evidence?
3. **Notification timing**: Was the 72-hour deadline tracked and met?
4. **Risk assessment quality**: Was the risk assessment methodology applied consistently and documented?
5. **Communication coordination**: Were media, customer, and internal communications coordinated and consistent?
6. **Escalation effectiveness**: Were the right people involved at the right time?
7. **Cross-functional coordination**: Did legal, privacy, IT, and communications work together effectively?
8. **Regulatory coordination**: Was the correct supervisory authority identified and notification prepared?
9. **Data subject communication**: Was Art. 34 notification considered at the appropriate threshold?
10. **Documentation**: Was the decision-making process documented in real-time?
