# US Federal Privacy Landscape

## Overview

The United States does not have a single comprehensive federal data protection law equivalent to the GDPR. Instead, the US employs a sectoral approach, with federal laws addressing privacy in specific contexts: health care (HIPAA), financial services (GLBA), children's online data (COPPA), education (FERPA), consumer reporting (FCRA), electronic communications (ECPA), and video rental records (VPPA). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) exercises broad privacy enforcement authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices. This patchwork creates a complex compliance landscape that requires mapping federal obligations alongside the growing number of state comprehensive privacy laws.

## Federal Sectoral Privacy Laws

## FTC Section 5 Authority

The FTC's authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)) serves as a de facto federal privacy enforcement baseline:

- **Unfairness prong**: Practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury not reasonably avoidable and not outweighed by countervailing benefits
- **Deception prong**: Material representation, omission, or practice likely to mislead consumers acting reasonably
- **Privacy-specific enforcement areas**:
  - Failure to honour privacy policy commitments
  - Inadequate data security practices
  - Deceptive data collection and sharing
  - Dark patterns in consent interfaces
  - Children's privacy violations (COPPA enforcement)
  - Health data practices (Health Breach Notification Rule, 16 CFR 318)

### FTC Health Breach Notification Rule (16 CFR Part 318)

- Applies to vendors of personal health records and PHR-related entities NOT covered by HIPAA
- Requires notification to FTC, individuals, and media of breaches of unsecured health information
- FTC has expanded interpretation to include health apps and connected devices

## Federal Preemption Considerations

The interaction between federal sectoral laws and state comprehensive privacy laws creates complex preemption questions:

- **HIPAA**: Preempts state laws that are contrary to HIPAA, but state laws providing greater protection survive (45 CFR 160.203)
- **GLBA**: Financial Privacy Rule preempts inconsistent state laws; Safeguards Rule does not preempt stricter state requirements
- **FCRA**: Broad preemption of state laws in areas where FCRA is comprehensive (Section 1681t)
- **COPPA**: Does not preempt state laws that are not inconsistent
- **State privacy laws**: Generally exempt HIPAA-covered data, GLBA-covered data, and FCRA-regulated activities from scope

## Proposed Federal Comprehensive Legislation

### American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA)
- H.R. 8152, 117th Congress (2022) — advanced through committee but not enacted
- Would have established federal consumer privacy rights: access, correction, deletion, portability, opt-out of targeted advertising
- Key unresolved issue: scope of federal preemption over state laws (especially California CCPA/CPRA)

### American Privacy Rights Act (APRA)
- Discussion draft, 118th Congress (2024)
- Bipartisan proposal with data minimisation requirements, private right of action, and FTC enforcement
- Preemption provisions remain the primary obstacle to enactment

## Integration Points

- **42-cfr-part-2**: Substance use disorder records under federal confidentiality protections
- **hipaa-compliance**: HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules
- **state-law-tracker**: Federal-state interaction and preemption analysis
- **vendor-privacy-due-diligence**: Business associate agreements (HIPAA) and service provider requirements (GLBA)
- **children-data-protection**: COPPA compliance for services directed at or used by children
