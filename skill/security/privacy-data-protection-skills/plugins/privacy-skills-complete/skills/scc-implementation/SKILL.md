# Implementing Standard Contractual Clauses

## Overview

Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 introduced modernised Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for the transfer of personal data to third countries under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. These SCCs replaced the prior sets adopted under Directive 95/46/EC and became the mandatory instrument from 27 December 2022. The modular architecture allows parties to select the appropriate clause set based on their roles in the transfer relationship.

## Module Selection Decision Framework

### Module 1: Controller to Controller (C2C)

**When to use**: The data exporter is a controller and the data importer independently determines the purposes and means of processing the imported data as a separate controller.

**Typical scenarios at Athena Global Logistics**:
- Sharing shipment tracking data with overseas partner logistics firms that independently process that data for their own route optimisation
- Providing employee data to a foreign group entity that acts as an independent controller for local employment law compliance
- Transferring customer data to an overseas insurance partner that underwrites cargo policies under its own controllership

**Key Module 1 clauses**:
- Clause 8.1 — Data protection safeguards: The data importer must process data only for the specific purposes described in Annex I, with an independent legal basis under the importer's applicable law
- Clause 8.2 — Purpose limitation: The importer shall not process data for purposes incompatible with those for which the data was transferred
- Clause 8.3 — Transparency: The importer must provide data subjects with a copy of the clauses and Annex I information upon request
- Clause 8.4 — Accuracy: Both parties must take reasonable steps to ensure data is accurate and up to date
- Clause 8.5 — Duration and erasure: Data processed only for the duration specified in Annex II; erasure or return upon termination

### Module 2: Controller to Processor (C2P)

**When to use**: The data exporter is a controller and the data importer processes data on behalf of the exporter as a processor.

**Typical scenarios at Athena Global Logistics**:
- Engaging a cloud infrastructure provider headquartered in a third country to host the transport management system
- Using an overseas payroll processing bureau to calculate salaries for locally-hired staff
- Contracting a third-country call centre to handle customer service inquiries on behalf of the company

**Key Module 2 clauses**:
- Clause 8.1 — Instructions: The processor shall process data only on documented instructions from the controller as specified in Annex II
- Clause 8.2 — Purpose limitation: Processing solely for the specific purposes set out in Annex I
- Clause 8.3 — Transparency: Controller must inform data subjects of the transfer and identity of the importer
- Clause 8.5 — Sub-processing: Sub-processors only with prior specific or general written authorisation; same data protection obligations imposed by contract
- Clause 8.6 — International onward transfers: Sub-processor transfers require the same level of protection
- Clause 8.8 — Security: Technical and organisational measures as described in Annex II
- Clause 8.9 — Documentation and compliance: Processor must maintain records and allow audits

### Module 3: Processor to Processor (P2P)

**When to use**: The data exporter is a processor (acting on behalf of an EU controller) and the data importer is a sub-processor.

**Typical scenarios at Athena Global Logistics**:
- The company acts as a data processor for a European shipping consortium and sub-contracts warehousing data management to a third-country sub-processor
- A managed IT services provider contracted by the company further sub-processes personal data with an offshore development centre

**Key Module 3 clauses**:
- Clause 8.1 — Instructions: Sub-processor processes only under the chain of instructions ultimately originating from the controller
- Clause 8.5 — Onward sub-processing: Further sub-processing only with prior specific or general written authorisation from the controller (obtained through the initial processor)
- Clause 8.8 — Security measures: Annex II security measures apply equivalently
- Clause 8.9 — Documentation and compliance: Full audit chain maintained back to the controller

### Module 4: Processor to Controller (P2C)

**When to use**: The data exporter is a processor and the data importer is the controller whose data is being returned or transferred.

**Typical scenarios at Athena Global Logistics**:
- Returning processed analytics results to a non-EU client controller who originally provided the raw shipment data
- A European cloud processor returning personal data to its non-EU controller client upon contract termination

**Key Module 4 clauses**:
- Clause 8.1 — The importer shall process data in compliance with its obligations under the GDPR (where applicable) or equivalent standards
- Clause 8.2 — Purpose limitation and transparency obligations on the importer as controller

## Module Selection Decision Tree

```
START: Identify the role of the data EXPORTER (EU-based party)

  |     ├── Importer determines its OWN purposes → MODULE 1 (C2C)
  |     |
  |     └── Importer processes ON BEHALF of exporter → MODULE 2 (C2P)
  |
  └── Exporter is a PROCESSOR
        |
        ├── Importer is a SUB-PROCESSOR → MODULE 3 (P2P)
        |
        └── Importer is the CONTROLLER (data return) → MODULE 4 (P2C)
