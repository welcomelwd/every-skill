# Conducting Data Protection Audit

## Overview

A data protection audit systematically evaluates an organisation's compliance with GDPR requirements across governance, processing activities, data subject rights, security measures, and third-party arrangements. This skill provides a structured audit framework with 50+ control points mapped to specific GDPR articles, enabling auditors to produce a comprehensive compliance assessment with prioritised remediation recommendations.

## Audit Framework Structure

The audit is organised into eight domains aligned to core GDPR chapters and articles:

1. Data Protection Principles (Art. 5)
2. Accountability and Governance (Art. 24, 5(2))
3. Privacy by Design and Default (Art. 25)
4. Processor Management (Art. 28)
5. Records of Processing (Art. 30)
6. Security of Processing (Art. 32)
7. Data Protection Impact Assessments (Art. 35)
8. Data Protection Officer (Art. 37-39)

## Audit Execution Methodology

### Phase 1: Planning (Week 1)
1. Define audit scope (full organisation or targeted domains).
2. Assemble audit team with data protection and information security expertise.
3. Issue audit notification to business units 2 weeks in advance.
4. Request pre-audit documentation package from each domain owner.

### Phase 2: Document Review (Weeks 2-3)
1. Review all requested evidence against each control point.
2. Classify each control as: Effective, Partially Effective, Ineffective, or Not Implemented.
3. Identify gaps where evidence is missing or insufficient.

### Phase 3: Testing and Interviews (Weeks 3-4)
1. Conduct interviews with processing owners, IT security, HR, legal, and the DPO.
2. Perform sample testing of key controls (e.g., access reviews, breach simulations, DSAR process walkthroughs).
3. Verify technical controls through configuration reviews or tool demonstrations.

### Phase 4: Reporting (Week 5)
1. Produce audit report with findings classified by severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Observation).
2. Include a compliance score per domain and overall maturity rating.
3. Provide prioritised remediation roadmap with owners and deadlines.
4. Present findings to the Data Protection Steering Committee and Board.

### Phase 5: Follow-up (Ongoing)
1. Track remediation actions through the findings register.
2. Conduct follow-up reviews at 30/60/90 day intervals depending on severity.
3. Feed audit findings into the annual DPO report and risk register updates.
