# Auditing Cookie Consent A/B Testing

## Overview

A/B testing consent banners is a common practice to optimize consent rates. However, when these experiments manipulate users into consenting through design asymmetry, deceptive patterns, or unequal ease of acceptance versus rejection, they violate GDPR Article 7 and ePrivacy Directive Article 5(3). The CNIL has been the most active enforcer, issuing a EUR 150 million fine to Google (January 2022) and a EUR 60 million fine to Meta (January 2022) specifically for consent banner design violations.

## Regulatory Framework for Consent Banner Design

### Equal Prominence Requirement

CNIL Deliberation No. 2020-091 (September 17, 2020) and EDPB Guidelines 05/2020 establish:

1. **Equal Visual Weight**: The "Accept" and "Reject" options must have the same visual prominence — same size, same color treatment, same font, same position hierarchy.
2. **Equal Interaction Cost**: Rejecting cookies must require the same number of clicks/steps as accepting.
3. **No Pre-Selection**: No purposes or vendors may be pre-selected.
4. **No Cookie Walls**: Access to content must not be conditioned on cookie acceptance.
5. **Neutral Language**: Neither option should use encouraging or discouraging language asymmetrically.

### Key Enforcement Actions

| Authority | Target | Fine | Date | Key Finding |
|-----------|--------|------|------|-------------|
| CNIL | Google LLC | EUR 150,000,000 | January 6, 2022 | google.fr: accepting cookies required 1 click; rejecting required multiple clicks through secondary menu |
| CNIL | Meta Platforms Ireland | EUR 60,000,000 | January 6, 2022 | facebook.com: "Accept Cookies" button prominently displayed; "Refuse" buried in secondary layer |
| CNIL | Microsoft Ireland | EUR 60,000,000 | December 22, 2022 | bing.com: "Accept" button displayed without equally visible "Refuse" |
| CNIL | TikTok | EUR 5,000,000 | December 29, 2022 | tiktok.com: rejecting cookies more complex than accepting; insufficient information |
| Italian Garante | Clearview AI | EUR 20,000,000 | March 9, 2022 | No valid consent mechanism for biometric data processing |

## Dark Pattern Detection Methodology

### Category 1: Visual Asymmetry

**What to check:**
- Accept button: color, size, font weight, border, shadow, position
- Reject button: color, size, font weight, border, shadow, position
- Are they visually equal? A bright green "Accept All" next to a grey text-link "Manage Preferences" fails this test.

**Measurement:**
- Button area (width x height in pixels)
- Color contrast ratio against background (WCAG calculation)
- Font size and weight
- Visual hierarchy position (above vs below the fold, left vs right)

### Category 2: Interaction Asymmetry

**What to check:**
- Clicks to accept all: typically 1 (click "Accept All")
- Clicks to reject all: should be 1 (click "Reject All") — NOT 2+ (click "Manage" then toggle then "Save")
- Is a "Reject All" button present on the first layer?

**CNIL standard:** A "Refuse All" button must be available on the same layer and with the same prominence as the "Accept All" button.

### Category 3: Language Manipulation

**What to check:**
- Accept text: neutral or encouraging? ("Accept and continue enjoying our site")
- Reject text: neutral or discouraging? ("I don't want a personalized experience")
- Is the reject option framed as losing something?

**Examples of non-compliant language:**
- Accept: "Accept and enjoy personalized content" / Reject: "Continue with limited experience" — FAIL
- Accept: "OK, I agree" / Reject: "Reject all cookies" — PASS (both neutral)

### Category 4: Timing and Delay Manipulation

**What to check:**
- Does the accept button appear before the reject button?
- Is there a loading delay on the reject path?
- Does dismissing the banner (X button) default to accepting?

### Category 5: Repeated Prompting (Nagging)

**What to check:**
- After rejecting, does the banner reappear on the next page?
- How frequently is reconsent requested?
- CNIL recommends no more than every 6 months.

## A/B Test Compliance Boundaries

What can be legitimately tested:

| Permitted Tests | Prohibited Tests |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Banner position (top vs bottom) | Accept button larger than reject button |
| Color scheme (both buttons same treatment) | Accept button more prominent than reject |
| Text wording (both options equally neutral) | Additional clicks required to reject |
| Layout arrangement (if equal prominence maintained) | Pre-selecting consent purposes in one variant |
| Icon usage (same for both options) | Cookie wall in any variant |
| Animation/transition style | Accept-only first layer with reject buried |
| Privacy information presentation format | Discouraging language for reject option |

## Audit Procedure

### Step 1: Capture All A/B Variants

For each active consent banner experiment:
- Screenshot all variants across desktop and mobile
- Record the HTML/CSS for accept and reject elements
- Document the user flow for accepting and rejecting in each variant
- Note the traffic split (what percentage of users see each variant)

### Step 2: Apply Dark Pattern Assessment

For each variant, score against the 5 categories:

| Category | Weight | Score (0-10) | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Visual Asymmetry | 25% | 0 = equal, 10 = extreme asymmetry | |
| Interaction Asymmetry | 30% | 0 = equal clicks, 10 = many more clicks to reject | |
| Language Manipulation | 20% | 0 = neutral, 10 = strongly manipulative | |
| Timing/Delay | 15% | 0 = no delays, 10 = significant delays on reject | |
| Repeated Prompting | 10% | 0 = respects choice, 10 = constant nagging | |

**Overall Risk Score:** Weighted sum. Score above 3.0 requires remediation. Score above 5.0 requires immediate removal.

### Step 3: Compare Consent Rates Across Variants

If a variant achieves significantly higher consent rates through design asymmetry rather than improved information, this is evidence of manipulation:

- **Baseline comparison**: Compare consent rates between fully symmetric designs
- **Red flag threshold**: If a variant achieves >20% higher consent rate AND has asymmetric design elements, flag for review
- **Statistical significance**: Use standard A/B testing statistical methods (chi-squared or Bayesian) but apply the regulatory lens — statistical significance of manipulation is evidence of violation

### Step 4: Document and Report

Generate audit report with:
- Screenshots of all variants
- Dark pattern scores per variant
- Consent rate analysis
- Recommendations for non-compliant variants
- Remediation timeline
