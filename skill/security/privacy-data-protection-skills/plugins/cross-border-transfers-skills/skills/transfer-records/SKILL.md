# Managing Transfer Records and Documentation

## Overview

Maintaining comprehensive transfer records and documentation is a foundational obligation under the GDPR and a practical necessity for demonstrating compliance with cross-border data transfer requirements. Articles 5(2) and 24 impose a general accountability obligation, while Article 30 mandates specific records of processing activities — including details of international transfers. Beyond these baseline requirements, each transfer mechanism (SCCs, BCRs, adequacy reliance, derogations) carries its own documentation expectations. This skill provides a structured approach to building, maintaining, and auditing transfer records across all mechanisms.

## Transfer Register: Core Fields

### Audit Trail Integrity

- Each audit log entry must be immutable once created
- Entries must include a timestamp (UTC) and authenticated user identity
- The audit trail must be protected against tampering (hash chains, write-once storage, or equivalent)
- Access to the audit trail must be restricted to authorised personnel (DPO, privacy counsel, internal audit)

## Documentation Packages by Mechanism

## Supervisory Authority Expectations

### Information to Produce on Request

Supervisory authorities expect organisations to produce the following within a reasonable timeframe (typically 2-4 weeks):

1. Complete transfer register covering all international transfers
2. Transfer mechanism documentation for any specific transfer
3. TIA documentation for transfers to non-adequate countries
4. Evidence of periodic reviews and updates

### Common SA Findings

| Finding | Description | Remediation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Incomplete register | Missing transfers or incomplete fields | Conduct full inventory; populate all mandatory fields |
| Stale TIAs | TIAs not updated after significant legal developments | Establish TIA review triggers and periodic review schedule |
| Missing execution dates | SCCs without documented execution dates | Obtain signed copies with dates; implement document management |
| No review schedule | No evidence of periodic transfer reviews | Establish annual review cycle; document in governance framework |
| Inadequate audit trail | Changes to transfer records not tracked | Implement audit logging; migrate to system with built-in audit trail |
| Missing sub-processor records | Incomplete or outdated sub-processor lists | Audit sub-processor chains; update SCC Annex III |

## Review and Governance Cycle

### Annual Review Cycle

| Quarter | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| Q1 | Full transfer register review: verify all active transfers, close terminated transfers, update mechanism status |
| Q2 | TIA refresh: reassess all transfers to non-adequate countries against current legal developments |
| Q3 | Mechanism review: verify SCC execution dates, BCR compliance, adequacy decision status, derogation continuing necessity |
| Q4 | Governance review: assess documentation completeness, audit trail integrity, SA readiness, update policies |

### Trigger-Based Reviews

In addition to the annual cycle, reviews must be triggered by:

- Change in destination country legislation or enforcement practice
- CJEU judgment affecting transfer mechanisms (e.g., Schrems-type ruling)
- EC adequacy decision adopted, amended, or revoked
- EDPB guidance or recommendation affecting transfer documentation
- Organisational change (new entity, acquisition, divestiture)
- Data breach involving transferred data
- Supervisory authority inquiry or investigation
