# Implementing GDPR Accountability Framework

## Overview

The accountability principle under Art. 5(2) requires controllers to not only comply with data protection principles but to demonstrate that compliance. Art. 24 operationalises this by requiring appropriate technical and organisational measures that can prove compliance, reviewed and updated where necessary. This skill provides a complete framework for building and maintaining the accountability evidence portfolio.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

1. Appoint or confirm the DPO with formal terms of reference and adequate resourcing.
2. Draft and obtain board approval for the top-level Data Protection Policy.
3. Establish the Data Protection Governance Charter with defined roles (DPO, steering committee, processing owners, data champions).
4. Conduct an initial processing activity inventory to populate the RoPA.
5. Implement a secure document management system for accountability records.

### Phase 2: Operational Documentation (Months 3-6)

1. Complete the RoPA with all Art. 30(1) mandatory fields for each processing activity.
2. Conduct lawful basis assessments for all processing activities and populate the lawful basis register.
3. Identify high-risk processing and initiate DPIAs per Art. 35.
4. Audit all processor relationships and execute Art. 28(3) compliant DPAs.
5. Document international transfer mechanisms and conduct Transfer Impact Assessments.
6. Implement consent management with auditable consent records.

### Phase 3: Procedures and Training (Months 6-9)

1. Develop operational procedures for: breach notification, DSAR handling, DPIA process, consent management, data retention enforcement.
2. Design and deploy the data protection training programme with role-specific modules.
3. Establish the personal data breach register and incident response procedure.
4. Create the data subject rights request handling process with SLA tracking.
5. Test all procedures through tabletop exercises.

### Phase 4: Continuous Compliance (Month 9 onwards)

1. Schedule the first annual data protection audit.
2. Produce the first DPO annual report for the board.
3. Implement ongoing monitoring: quarterly RoPA reviews, monthly DSAR metrics, weekly breach register review.
4. Feed audit findings and incident learnings into policy and procedure updates.
5. Track regulatory developments and update the framework as required.

## Maturity Assessment

Assess accountability maturity across five levels:

| Level | Description | Indicators |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 — Ad Hoc | No systematic accountability | Policies absent, no RoPA, no DPO, no training |
| 2 — Reactive | Basic compliance efforts triggered by incidents or complaints | Some policies exist, RoPA incomplete, training ad hoc |
| 3 — Defined | Systematic framework established with documented procedures | All Tier 1-2 documents exist, DPO appointed, annual training |
| 4 — Managed | Framework actively maintained with metrics and monitoring | Regular audits, DSAR tracking, breach register maintained, board reporting |
| 5 — Optimised | Continuous improvement with proactive risk management | Privacy by design embedded, automated monitoring, predictive risk assessment |
