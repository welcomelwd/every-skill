# Conducting Post-Breach Remediation

## Overview

Post-breach remediation transforms the findings from a breach investigation into concrete corrective actions that prevent recurrence and demonstrate accountability under GDPR Art. 5(2) and Art. 24. Effective remediation goes beyond fixing the immediate vulnerability — it addresses root causes, closes systemic control gaps, updates policies and training, enhances monitoring, and satisfies regulatory follow-up requirements.

## Lessons Learned Framework

### Step 1: Root Cause Remediation (Immediate — Within 30 Days)

Address the direct technical and procedural cause of the breach:

| Root Cause Category | Remediation Approach | Example (SPG-BREACH-2026-003) |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Stale privileged account | Decommission account, implement lifecycle management | Revoked svc-migration-2024; deployed automated service account expiry (90-day review cycle) |
| Phishing vulnerability | Deploy phishing-resistant MFA, enhance email filtering | Migrated from push-based MFA to FIDO2/WebAuthn for all privileged accounts |
| Insufficient network segmentation | Implement micro-segmentation | Deployed database-tier isolation; access only via approved bastion host with session recording |
| Inadequate access review scope | Expand access review to include all account types | Added service accounts, API keys, and machine accounts to quarterly access certification |

### Step 2: Control Gap Closure (Short-Term — Within 90 Days)

Identify and close broader security and privacy control gaps revealed by the breach:

1. **Detection gap**: Was the breach detected by the organization's own controls, or was it reported externally? If detection was delayed, strengthen monitoring.
2. **Response gap**: Were response procedures followed? Where did the team deviate from the plan? Update procedures based on actual experience.
3. **Communication gap**: Were internal and external communications timely and accurate? Update communication templates and escalation matrices.
4. **Documentation gap**: Were the Art. 33(5) documentation requirements met in real-time? Improve documentation tools and checklists.
5. **Vendor/processor gap**: If a processor was involved, was the Art. 28 DPA adequate? Were processor security requirements sufficient? Update vendor risk assessment and DPA terms.

### Step 3: Policy Updates (Medium-Term — Within 90 Days)

Review and update affected policies based on breach findings:

| Policy | Update Required | Owner | Deadline |
|--------|----------------|-------|----------|
| Access Control Policy | Include service accounts in scope; define lifecycle management requirements | CISO | 15 April 2026 |
| Incident Response Plan | Update awareness definition; add holding statement template; revise escalation matrix | DPO + CISO | 30 April 2026 |
| Ransom Payment Policy | Document Board-approved position on ransom payments | General Counsel | 31 May 2026 |
| Vendor Risk Management | Add security assessment questionnaire updates based on processor breach lessons | Procurement + DPO | 30 June 2026 |
| Data Retention Policy | Verify that expired data was actually deleted per schedule (breach may have revealed retention failures) | DPO | 30 June 2026 |

### Step 4: Training Modifications (Medium-Term — Within 90 Days)

Update training programs to address the human factors contributing to the breach:

| Training Module | Target Audience | Update | Delivery Method |
|----------------|----------------|--------|-----------------|
| Phishing awareness | All employees | Add scenario based on the actual phishing email that initiated SPG-BREACH-2026-003 (with identifying details removed) | Interactive simulation via KnowBe4 |
| MFA security | All employees with MFA | Add push-fatigue attack awareness; train on rejecting unexpected MFA prompts | Mandatory e-learning module |
| Incident reporting | All employees | Clarify that unusual system behavior must be reported immediately, even if uncertain | Updated in annual privacy awareness training |
| Breach response | Incident response team | Tabletop exercise based on this breach scenario | Semi-annual tabletop exercise |
| Privileged access management | IT operations, DBAs | Service account lifecycle management procedures | Department-specific workshop |

### Step 5: Monitoring Enhancements (Medium-Term — Within 90 Days)

Strengthen detection and monitoring based on gaps the breach revealed:

| Enhancement | Description | Owner | Deadline |
|-------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Service account anomaly detection | SIEM rule to alert when service accounts authenticate outside scheduled batch windows or from non-whitelisted IPs | SOC Lead | 15 April 2026 |
| MFA push-fatigue detection | Alert when an account receives more than 3 MFA push notifications in 5 minutes without successful authentication | SOC Lead | 30 April 2026 |
| Tor exit node blocking | Block authentication attempts from known Tor exit nodes for all production systems | Network Security | 15 April 2026 |
| Network flow baseline for database tier | Establish outbound data transfer baselines for database VLAN; alert on anomalies | SOC Lead | 31 May 2026 |

### Step 6: Regulatory Follow-Up (Ongoing)

Manage ongoing obligations to supervisory authorities:

1. **Supplementary notifications**: Provide any outstanding information committed to in the initial Art. 33 notification (e.g., exfiltration determination, final data subject count).
2. **Authority inquiries**: Respond promptly and comprehensively to any follow-up questions from the supervisory authority.
3. **Remediation evidence**: Be prepared to provide evidence of remediation actions to the authority upon request. Maintain a remediation tracker with completion dates and evidence references.
4. **Regulatory proceedings**: If the authority initiates formal proceedings, coordinate response with external counsel.
5. **Annual DPO report**: Include the breach and remediation status in the DPO's annual report to the Board and supervisory authority.

## Remediation Tracking

### Remediation Register Structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Action ID | Unique identifier (SPG-BREACH-2026-003-REM-001) |
| Breach reference | Link to the source breach |
| Description | What needs to be done |
| Root cause addressed | Which root cause or gap this action closes |
| Owner | Person responsible for completion |
| Priority | Critical / High / Medium / Low |
| Target date | Planned completion date |
| Actual completion date | When the action was verified as complete |
| Evidence | Documentation proving completion (screenshot, policy version, test report) |
| Verified by | Person who verified the action was effectively implemented |

### Escalation for Overdue Actions

| Days Overdue | Escalation |
|-------------|-----------|
| 1-7 days | Reminder to action owner |
| 8-14 days | Escalation to action owner's manager |
| 15-30 days | Escalation to DPO and CISO |
| 30+ days | Escalation to CEO; inclusion in Board Audit Committee report |

## Post-Breach Review Meeting

### Agenda (Conducted 30 Days After Breach Closure)

1. **Breach summary**: 5-minute recap of the incident.
2. **Root cause review**: Confirm root cause analysis is accurate and complete.
3. **Remediation status**: Review all remediation actions — completed, in progress, overdue.
4. **Effectiveness assessment**: Have the implemented remediations been tested and proven effective?
5. **Residual risk**: What risk remains after remediation? Is it within the organization's risk appetite?
6. **Lessons for next time**: What would we do differently? What worked well?
7. **Documentation closure**: Confirm all Art. 33(5) documentation is complete.

## Demonstrating Accountability

Under GDPR Art. 5(2), the controller must demonstrate compliance. Post-breach remediation evidence serves this purpose:

- **Before the breach**: Risk assessments, security measures, training records, and policies demonstrate preventive efforts.
- **During the breach**: Incident response documentation, notification records, and communication logs demonstrate responsive handling.
- **After the breach**: Remediation tracker, updated policies, enhanced controls, and improved training demonstrate learning and improvement.

A supervisory authority reviewing the organization's breach response will assess not only whether the breach was handled correctly but whether the organization took meaningful steps to prevent recurrence.
