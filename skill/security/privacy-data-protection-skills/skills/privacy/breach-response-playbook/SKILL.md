# Building Breach Response Team Playbook

## Overview

A breach response team playbook is the operational manual that enables rapid, coordinated response when a personal data breach occurs. It pre-defines roles and responsibilities, escalation paths, communication templates, and external contact information so that the response team can act immediately without spending critical hours on logistics during an actual incident.

## Escalation Matrix

### Severity Classification
