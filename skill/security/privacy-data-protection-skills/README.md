## Why This Exists

AI agents are increasingly used for privacy compliance tasks but operate with zero structured knowledge of privacy regulations, leading to:

- Hallucinated regulation citations (invented GDPR articles, wrong CFR sections)
- Missed jurisdiction-specific requirements (PIPL data localization, LGPD 10 lawful bases)
- Incorrect breach notification timelines (72h GDPR vs 60d HIPAA vs 3d Singapore)
- Dangerous oversimplification of cross-border transfer mechanisms

Each skill provides structured, verified regulatory knowledge that AI agents load on demand, replacing hallucination with precision.

**Real-world use cases:**
- An AI agent processing a **Data Subject Access Request** across EU and US jurisdictions
- An AI agent conducting a **Privacy Impact Assessment** for an AI system ahead of the EU AI Act August 2026 deadline
- An AI agent evaluating **cross-border data transfer mechanisms** (SCCs, BCRs, adequacy decisions) for a multinational organization

**Disclaimer:** These skills are educational reference materials, not legal advice. Consult qualified legal counsel for compliance decisions.

## How Skills Work

Every skill follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard:

```
skills/privacy/conducting-gdpr-dpia/
  SKILL.md              # YAML frontmatter + workflow
  references/
    standards.md        # Regulatory citations, enforcement precedents
    workflows.md        # Step-by-step procedures with timelines
  scripts/
    process.py          # Working Python 3 automation (stdlib only)
  assets/
    template.md         # Filled real-world example
```

SKILL.md format:
```yaml
---
name: conducting-gdpr-dpia
description: >-
  Conducts GDPR Data Protection Impact Assessments under Article 35
  following EDPB WP248rev.01 nine-criteria methodology.
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  author: mukul975
  version: "1.0"
  domain: privacy
  subdomain: privacy-impact-assessment
  tags: "dpia, gdpr, article-35, risk-assessment, edpb"
---
```

Progressive disclosure: agents load only YAML frontmatter (~30-50 tokens) for relevance matching. Full skill content loads only when needed. References, scripts, and templates load on demand.
