# Notion Search

Use the Notion MCP server to search the user's Notion workspace for content related to the query.

## Behavior

- Interpret the query as a natural-language search (e.g. "Q1 roadmap", "customer feedback", "bugs triage").
- Prefer fast, high-signal tools such as workspace search or database queries.
- If multiple results are found, summarize them as a short, scannable list, including:
  - Page/database title
  - Type (page, database, task list, etc.)
  - A one-line description or key fields
- If no results are found, suggest refinements or alternative queries.

When you answer, **do not** dump raw JSON. Return a human-readable summary with links/identifiers that the user can click in Notion.
