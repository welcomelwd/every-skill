## Overview

The test infrastructure lives in two primary locations:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tests/fixtures/` | Reusable test helpers: runners, matchers, cleanup, log parsing |
| `tests/setup/` | Jest configuration and setup files |
| `scripts/ci/` | CI-specific cleanup and workflow post-processing scripts |

The suite contains **26 integration test files** across `tests/integration/`, all executed serially via Jest with a 120-second per-test timeout.

### Key Files

| File | Lines | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| `tests/fixtures/awf-runner.ts` | 331 | Core test runner — wraps AWF CLI invocations |
| `tests/fixtures/batch-runner.ts` | 118 | Batches multiple commands into a single container |
| `tests/fixtures/assertions.ts` | 179 | Custom Jest matchers (`toSucceed`, `toFail`, etc.) |
| `tests/fixtures/docker-helper.ts` | 297 | Low-level Docker operations helper |
| `tests/fixtures/cleanup.ts` | 209 | TypeScript port of `cleanup.sh` |
| `tests/fixtures/log-parser.ts` | 224 | Squid and iptables log parsing |
| `tests/setup/jest.integration.config.js` | 24 | Jest config for integration tests |
| `tests/setup/jest.setup.ts` | 9 | Registers custom matchers globally |
| `scripts/ci/cleanup.sh` | 56 | Bash cleanup script for CI |
| `scripts/ci/postprocess-smoke-workflows.ts` | 150 | Post-processes compiled workflow YAML for CI |

---

## Test Runner Architecture

### AwfRunner (`tests/fixtures/awf-runner.ts`)

The `AwfRunner` class is the central abstraction for integration tests. It wraps the AWF CLI binary and provides two execution modes:

#### `run(command, options)` — Direct execution
- Runs `node dist/cli.js <args> -- <command>` directly
- Suitable for tests that don't require iptables (no sudo)
- Rarely used in practice (most tests need sudo for iptables)

#### `runWithSudo(command, options)` — Privileged execution
- Runs `sudo -E --preserve-env=PATH,HOME,... node dist/cli.js <args> -- <command>`
- Preserves critical environment variables (`PATH`, `HOME`, `GOROOT`, `CARGO_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME`, `DOTNET_ROOT`)
- Required for real firewall operation (iptables NAT rules)
- Used by ~95% of integration tests

#### AwfOptions Interface

All CLI flags are exposed as typed options:

```typescript
interface AwfOptions {
  allowDomains?: string[];
  keepContainers?: boolean;
  logLevel?: 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
  buildLocal?: boolean;
  imageRegistry?: string;
  imageTag?: string;
  timeout?: number;              // Default: 120000ms
  env?: Record<string, string>;
  volumeMounts?: string[];
  containerWorkDir?: string;
  tty?: boolean;
  dnsServers?: string[];
  allowHostPorts?: string;
  enableApiProxy?: boolean;
}
```

#### AwfResult Interface

Every invocation returns a structured result:

```typescript
interface AwfResult {
  exitCode: number;
  stdout: string;
  stderr: string;
  success: boolean;      // exitCode === 0
  timedOut: boolean;
  workDir?: string;      // Extracted from stderr: /tmp/awf-<timestamp>
}
```

The `workDir` is particularly important — it's extracted from AWF's stderr logs and used by log-based assertions (`toAllowDomain`, `toBlockDomain`) to locate Squid access logs.

#### Typical Test Pattern

```typescript
describe('Feature X', () => {
  let runner: AwfRunner;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    await cleanup(false);       // Pre-test cleanup
    runner = createRunner();
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    await cleanup(false);       // Post-test cleanup
  });

  test('should do something', async () => {
    const result = await runner.runWithSudo(
      'curl -f https://api.github.com/zen',
      {
        allowDomains: ['github.com'],
        logLevel: 'debug',
        timeout: 60000,
      }
    );
    expect(result).toSucceed();
  }, 120000);  // Jest timeout (must be >= AWF timeout)
});
```

### Jest Configuration (`tests/setup/jest.integration.config.js`)

Key settings:

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| `testTimeout` | 120000 (2 min) | Firewall tests involve Docker container lifecycle |
| `maxWorkers` | 1 | Serial execution — avoids Docker network/container conflicts |
| `verbose` | true | Full test output for CI debugging |
| `preset` | `ts-jest` | TypeScript compilation |
| `setupFilesAfterEnv` | `jest.setup.ts` | Registers custom matchers before tests run |

Tests are discovered from `tests/integration/**/*.test.ts`.

---

## Abstractions Provided

### Custom Jest Matchers (`tests/fixtures/assertions.ts`)

Six custom matchers extend Jest's `expect()`, registered globally via `jest.setup.ts`:

| Matcher | Asserts | Input |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `toSucceed()` | `result.success === true` (exit code 0) | `AwfResult` |
| `toFail()` | `result.success === false` (non-zero exit) | `AwfResult` |
| `toExitWithCode(code)` | `result.exitCode === code` | `AwfResult` |
| `toTimeout()` | `result.timedOut === true` | `AwfResult` |
| `toAllowDomain(domain)` | Domain appears as `TCP_TUNNEL` in Squid logs | `AwfResult` |
| `toBlockDomain(domain)` | Domain appears as `TCP_DENIED` in Squid logs | `AwfResult` |

**Type declarations** are in `tests/jest-custom-matchers.d.ts`, included in test files via:
```typescript
/// <reference path="../jest-custom-matchers.d.ts" />
```

#### Log-Based Matchers

`toAllowDomain` and `toBlockDomain` are more sophisticated — they:
1. Extract `workDir` from the `AwfResult`
2. Read `${workDir}/squid-logs/access.log` synchronously (Jest matchers must be sync)
3. Parse the Squid log using `LogParser`
4. Check for `TCP_TUNNEL` (allowed) or `TCP_DENIED` (blocked) entries for the domain

These require `keepContainers: true` to preserve the work directory.

### Docker Helper (`tests/fixtures/docker-helper.ts`)

A general-purpose Docker operations wrapper:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `pullImage(image)` | Pull a Docker image |
| `run(options)` | Run a container with full option support |
| `stop(name)` | Stop a container |
| `rm(name, force?)` | Remove a container |
| `inspect(name)` | Get container state and network info |
| `logs(name, options?)` | Retrieve container logs |
| `exec(name, command)` | Execute command in running container |
| `networkExists(name)` | Check if a Docker network exists |
| `createNetwork(name, subnet?)` | Create a Docker network |
| `removeNetwork(name)` | Remove a Docker network |
| `listContainers(options?)` | List containers by filter |
| `wait(name)` | Wait for container exit and return exit code |
| `isRunning(name)` | Check if a container is currently running |

All methods use `execa` with `reject: false` to handle errors gracefully.

**Note:** This helper is available but less commonly used in practice — most tests go through `AwfRunner.runWithSudo()` which handles the full container lifecycle automatically.

### Log Parser (`tests/fixtures/log-parser.ts`)

Parses two log formats:

#### Squid Log Parser

Parses the `firewall_detailed` log format:
```
%ts.%03tu %>a:%>p %{Host}>h %<a:%<p %rv %rm %>Hs %Ss:%Sh %ru "%{User-Agent}>h"
```

Into typed `SquidLogEntry` objects with fields: `timestamp`, `clientIp`, `clientPort`, `host`, `destIp`, `destPort`, `protocol`, `method`, `statusCode`, `decision`, `hierarchy`, `url`, `userAgent`.

Filtering methods:
- `filterByDecision(entries, 'allowed' | 'blocked')` — Filter by `TCP_TUNNEL`/`TCP_DENIED`
- `filterByDomain(entries, domain)` — Filter by exact or subdomain match
- `getUniqueDomains(entries)` — Deduplicated domain list
- `wasAllowed(entries, domain)` / `wasBlocked(entries, domain)` — Boolean checks

#### iptables Log Parser

Parses kernel log entries prefixed with `[FW_BLOCKED_UDP]` or `[FW_BLOCKED_OTHER]` from `dmesg` output.

---

## Batch Runner Pattern

### Problem

Each `runner.runWithSudo()` call spawns a full Docker container lifecycle: config generation, Docker Compose up (Squid + Agent), iptables setup, command execution, teardown. This takes **15-25 seconds per invocation**.

The chroot language test suite originally had ~73 individual test invocations, each with this overhead.

### Solution: `batch-runner.ts`

The batch runner groups commands that share the same `AwfOptions` (particularly `allowDomains`) into a **single AWF container invocation**. This reduced the chroot suite from ~73 to ~27 container startups.

#### How It Works

1. **Script Generation** — Each command is wrapped in delimiters:
   ```bash
   echo "===BATCH_START:python_version==="
   (python3 --version) 2>&1
   _EC=$?
   echo ""
   echo "===BATCH_EXIT:python_version:$_EC==="
   ```

2. **Single Invocation** — The concatenated script runs as one `runWithSudo()` call.

3. **Result Parsing** — The combined stdout is parsed back into per-command results:
   ```typescript
   const batch = await runBatch(runner, [
     { name: 'python_version', command: 'python3 --version' },
     { name: 'node_version', command: 'node --version' },
   ], { allowDomains: ['github.com'] });

   expect(batch.get('python_version').exitCode).toBe(0);
   ```

#### Interface

```typescript
interface BatchCommand {
  name: string;    // Unique identifier for this command
  command: string; // Shell command to execute
}

interface BatchCommandResult {
  stdout: string;   // Captured output (stdout + stderr merged)
  exitCode: number; // Per-command exit code
}

interface BatchResults {
  get(name: string): BatchCommandResult;  // Throws if name not found
  overall: AwfResult;                      // Raw AWF result for the whole batch
}
```

#### Design Decisions

- Each command runs in a **subshell** `(cmd) 2>&1` so failures don't abort the batch
- **stdout and stderr are merged** via `2>&1` — individual stderr is not preserved
- Exit code is captured immediately into `_EC=$?` before `echo` resets `$?`
- Delimiter tokens (`===BATCH_START:`, `===BATCH_EXIT:`) chosen to be unlikely in real output
- If the batch is killed early, missing commands get `exitCode: -1`

#### Usage Pattern in Tests

The batch runner is used in `beforeAll` to run all commands once, then individual `test()` blocks assert against named results:

```typescript
describe('Quick checks (batched)', () => {
  let batch: BatchResults;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    batch = await runBatch(runner, [
      { name: 'python_version', command: 'python3 --version' },
      { name: 'go_version', command: 'go version' },
    ], { allowDomains: ['github.com'], timeout: 120000 });
  }, 180000);

  test('Python available', () => {
    expect(batch.get('python_version').exitCode).toBe(0);
  });

  test('Go available', () => {
    expect(batch.get('go_version').exitCode).toBe(0);
  });
});
```

This pattern is used extensively in `chroot-languages.test.ts` (17 batched commands) and `chroot-package-managers.test.ts`.

## Cleanup Strategy

The cleanup system uses a **defense-in-depth** approach across four stages, accounting for the fact that Docker container and network resources can leak when processes are killed mid-lifecycle.

### Stage 1: Pre-Test Cleanup (TypeScript)

**File:** `tests/fixtures/cleanup.ts`

The `Cleanup` class is a TypeScript port of the shell script, providing the same operations as programmable methods:

```typescript
class Cleanup {
  removeContainers()           // docker rm -f awf-squid awf-agent
  stopDockerComposeServices()  // docker compose down -v for all /tmp/awf-*/
  cleanupIptables()            // Remove FW_WRAPPER chain from DOCKER-USER
  removeNetwork()              // docker network rm awf-net
  pruneContainers()            // docker container prune -f
  pruneNetworks()              // docker network prune -f (fixes "Pool overlaps")
  removeWorkDirectories()      // rm -rf /tmp/awf-*
  cleanAll()                   // All of the above in sequence
}
```

Called in `beforeAll` and `afterAll` of every test `describe` block:
```typescript
beforeAll(async () => { await cleanup(false); });
afterAll(async () => { await cleanup(false); });
```

### Stage 2: Normal Exit (AWF Built-in)

AWF's own cleanup in `src/cli.ts`:
- `docker compose down -v` stops containers
- Deletes the work directory `/tmp/awf-<timestamp>`

### Stage 3: Signal/Error (AWF Built-in)

SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers in `src/cli.ts` trigger the same cleanup as normal exit. Cannot catch SIGKILL.

### Stage 4: CI Always Cleanup (Shell Script)

**File:** `scripts/ci/cleanup.sh`

A bash script that performs the same operations as the TypeScript `Cleanup` class. Run as a safety net in CI workflows with `if: always()`.

Operations:
1. `docker rm -f awf-squid awf-agent`
2. `docker compose -f /tmp/awf-*/docker-compose.yml down -v`
3. Remove `FW_WRAPPER` iptables chain from `DOCKER-USER`
4. `docker network rm awf-net`
5. `docker container prune -f`
6. `docker network prune -f` (critical for subnet pool management)
7. `rm -rf /tmp/awf-*`

### Why Multi-Stage?

The `timeout` command used in CI can SIGKILL the AWF process after a grace period, bypassing stages 2-3. Without stages 1 and 4, orphaned Docker networks accumulate and eventually exhaust the subnet pool ("Pool overlaps" errors).

---

## CI Workflow Post-Processing

### `scripts/ci/postprocess-smoke-workflows.ts`

After `gh-aw compile` generates `.lock.yml` workflow files, this script transforms them for CI use:

| Transformation | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| Replace "Install awf binary" step with `npm ci && npm run build` | Use locally-built code instead of pre-built GHCR binary |
| Remove `sparse-checkout` blocks | Full repo checkout needed for npm build |
| Remove `depth: 1` shallow clone | Full checkout needed |
| Replace `--image-tag X --skip-pull` with `--build-local` | Use locally-built container images |

Processes workflow files (5 smoke, 1 build-test, 13 agentic, 3 secret-digger) across the suite. Ensures CI tests use the current source code rather than stale published images.

---

## Limitations

### 1. Serial Execution Only

`maxWorkers: 1` means all 26 test files run sequentially. A full integration suite run takes **30-60+ minutes** depending on the number of container startups.

**Root cause:** All tests share the same Docker network (`172.30.0.0/24`), container names (`awf-squid`, `awf-agent`), and iptables chains. Parallel execution would cause conflicts.

### 2. No Per-Test Isolation

Tests within a `describe` block share the same `AwfRunner` instance. While each `runWithSudo()` call creates a fresh container, there's no mechanism to isolate host-level side effects (iptables rules, Docker networks) between individual tests.

### 3. Batch Runner Loses Individual stderr

The batch runner merges stdout and stderr (`2>&1`), so per-command stderr is mixed into stdout. Tests can't distinguish between a command's stdout and stderr output.

### 4. Log-Based Matchers Require `keepContainers`

`toAllowDomain` and `toBlockDomain` read Squid logs from the work directory, which is deleted during normal cleanup. Tests using these matchers must pass `keepContainers: true` and manually call `cleanup()` after assertions.

### 5. Timeout Duplication

Every test has **two timeout values**: the AWF timeout in `AwfOptions` (default 120s) and the Jest test timeout (the second argument to `test()`). These must be kept in sync manually, with the Jest timeout always exceeding the AWF timeout.

### 6. No Retry Logic

Flaky tests (network issues, Docker daemon slowness) have no built-in retry mechanism. The test infrastructure treats every failure as final.

### 7. Docker Dependency

All integration tests require:
- Docker daemon running
- sudo access for iptables
- Port 3128 available for Squid
- The `172.30.0.0/24` subnet unoccupied

This makes local development testing impossible without a Linux environment with Docker.

### 8. Cleanup Is Aggressive

`docker container prune -f` and `docker network prune -f` in the cleanup routine can affect non-AWF containers and networks on the same host. This is safe in CI but could be problematic in shared development environments.

---

## Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Dynamic Network Allocation

Instead of hardcoding `172.30.0.0/24`, assign a unique subnet per test run. This would enable limited parallelism (2-3 workers) and eliminate "Pool overlaps" errors at the source.

### 2. Test Grouping by Domain Config

The batch runner already groups commands by `AwfOptions`. This pattern could be extended: tests that share `allowDomains` and other config could be automatically grouped into fewer container invocations, even across test files.

### 3. Container Caching / Reuse

For tests that share the same `allowDomains` config, the Squid proxy container could be kept running between tests, avoiding the ~10s container startup per invocation. Only the agent container would need to restart.

### 4. Parallel-Safe Container Names

Using unique prefixes (e.g., `awf-<random>-squid` instead of `awf-squid`) would allow multiple test runs or workers simultaneously.

### 5. Flaky Test Retry

A Jest `retryTimes` configuration or custom retry wrapper for network-dependent tests would improve CI reliability without masking real failures.

### 6. Separate stderr in Batch Runner

The batch runner could be enhanced to capture stderr separately by writing it to a temp file:
```bash
(cmd) 2>/tmp/batch_stderr_name
```
This would preserve per-command stderr for better failure diagnostics.

### 7. Automatic Timeout Synchronization

A helper that sets both the AWF timeout and the Jest timeout from a single value would eliminate the timeout duplication issue:
```typescript
function testWithTimeout(name, fn, timeoutMs) {
  const awfTimeout = timeoutMs - 30000; // Buffer for container lifecycle
  test(name, () => fn(awfTimeout), timeoutMs);
}
```

### 8. Targeted Cleanup

Replace `docker container/network prune -f` with targeted removal of AWF-specific resources only (e.g., by label or name pattern). This would make the cleanup safe for shared environments.

### 9. Test Fixture for Common Assertions

Many tests repeat the same pattern: run a curl command, check `toSucceed()` or `toFail()`. A higher-level fixture could encapsulate this:
```typescript
await expectDomainAllowed(runner, 'github.com');
await expectDomainBlocked(runner, 'example.com', { allowDomains: ['github.com'] });
```

### 10. Pre-built Docker Image Caching

Integration tests that use `--build-local` rebuild containers from scratch every time. A CI-level image cache (built once, reused across tests) would save significant time.
