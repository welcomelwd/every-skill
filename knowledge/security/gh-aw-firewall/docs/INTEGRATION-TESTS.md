### Unified enclave coverage

Legacy bounded smoke and runtime-matrix assets were removed from the owned workflow surface. Until a unified gh-aw enclave smoke workflow exists, coverage for the enclave MCP server and executor contracts stays local/unit-focused:

- `src/services/enclave-mcp-service.test.ts`
- `src/services/enclave-agent-service.test.ts`
- `src/enclave/script-runner-spec.test.ts`
- `src/enclave/agent-runner-spec.test.ts`
- `src/enclave/manager.test.ts`
- `src/enclave/mcp-server.test.ts`
- `src/enclave/agent-mcp-server.test.ts`

These cover the shared tool contract, gVisor routing assumptions, fail-closed `sbx` behavior, and the mcpg-only topology.

## What's Covered

### 1. Chroot Filesystem Isolation (Strong)

The chroot tests are the most mature, run in CI, and cover critical scenarios:

- **Language runtimes**: Python, Node.js, Go, Java, .NET, Ruby, Rust all verified accessible through chroot
- **Package managers**: pip, npm, cargo, maven, dotnet, gem, go modules — all tested for registry connectivity
- **Security properties**: NET_ADMIN/SYS_CHROOT capability drop, Docker socket hidden, non-root execution
- **/proc filesystem**: Dynamic mount verified for JVM and .NET CLR compatibility
- **Shell features**: Pipes, redirects, command substitution, compound commands all work in chroot

**CI coverage**: 4 parallel jobs in `test-chroot.yml` exercise these tests on every PR.

### 2. Credential Isolation (Strong)

Multi-layered defense tested at each level:

- **Credential file hiding**: Docker config, GitHub CLI tokens, npmrc auth tokens all verified hidden via `/dev/null` overlays
- **Exfiltration resistance**: base64 encoding, xxd pipelines, grep patterns all tested — return empty
- **Chroot bypass prevention**: Specific regression test for the vulnerability where credentials were accessible at `$HOME` but not `/host$HOME`
- **API proxy sidecar**: Agent gets placeholder tokens; real keys held by proxy. Healthchecks for OpenAI, Anthropic, Copilot
- **One-shot token library**: LD_PRELOAD intercepts `getenv()`, caches value, clears from environment. Tested in both container and chroot modes
- **Token unsetting from /proc/1/environ**: GITHUB_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY all verified cleared

### 3. Multi-Engine Smoke Tests (Strong)

Real AI agents running through the full AWF pipeline:

- **Claude**: GitHub MCP, Playwright browser automation, file I/O, bash tools
- **Copilot**: Same + web-fetch, agentic-workflows tools
- **Codex**: GH CLI safe inputs, Tavily web search, discussion interactions

### 4. Multi-Language Build-Test (Strong)

8 language ecosystems tested with real open-source projects:

- Bun, C++, Deno, .NET, Go, Java, Node.js, Rust
- Each clones a test repo, installs dependencies, builds, and runs tests through AWF

### 5. Exit Code Propagation (Good)

15 tests covering exit codes 0-255, command exit codes, pipeline behavior. Critical for CI/CD integration where non-zero = failure.

## Test Infrastructure Summary

### How Tests Run

- **Serial execution** (`maxWorkers: 1`) — Docker network/container conflicts prevent parallelism
- **120-second timeout** per test — container lifecycle takes 15-25 seconds
- **Batch runner** groups commands sharing the same config into single containers — reduces ~73 startups to ~27 for chroot tests
- **Custom Jest matchers**: `toSucceed()`, `toFail()`, `toExitWithCode()`, `toTimeout()`, `toAllowDomain()`, `toBlockDomain()`
- **4-stage cleanup**: pre-test TypeScript cleanup → AWF normal exit → AWF signal handlers → CI always-cleanup

### Infrastructure Limitations

1. Docker + sudo required — no lightweight local testing
2. Batch runner loses individual stderr (merged via `2>&1`)
3. Log-based matchers require `keepContainers: true`
4. Aggressive `docker prune` in cleanup can affect non-AWF containers
5. No retry logic for flaky network tests

See [test-infra.md](test-analysis/test-infra.md) for full infrastructure analysis.

## Firecracker preview integration tests

The dedicated Firecracker CI workflow is disabled. The deterministic artifact
build and live KVM smoke scripts remain available for explicit local validation,
but they are not run by pull request, push, schedule, or manual Actions events.

The live smoke/security suite verifies all five SHA-256 digests before running.
Its preflight requires usable KVM and fails closed if `/dev/kvm` or another
required host capability is unavailable.

Live assertions (see `scripts/ci/firecracker-live-smoke.sh`):

| Case | What it proves |
|------|---------------|
| `allowed-https` | Allowed domains reach the internet through Squid |
| `blocked-domain` | Non-allowlisted domains are blocked |
| `direct-egress` | Bypassing proxy env vars does not enable direct egress |
| `arbitrary-tcp` | Raw TCP to arbitrary IPs is blocked |
| `dns-denial` | Direct DNS (8.8.8.8:53) is blocked from the guest |
| `metadata-denial` | EC2/GCP/Azure instance metadata IP (`169.254.169.254`) is unreachable |
| `api-proxy-reflect` | API proxy `/reflect` reachable; secret sentinel not present in output |
| `workspace-copyback` | Guest file writes, permission changes, and symlinks survive copy-back |
| `exit-code` | Agent exit code propagates faithfully (37 → 37) |
| `timeout-124` | Timed-out agent exits 124 |
| `partial-start-cleanup` | Corrupt rootfs causes clean failure; no namespace residue |
| `cancellation` | `SIGTERM` cleans up network namespace; exits 143 |
| `keep` | `--keep-containers` preserves jail/namespace/images; all diagnostics ≤1 MiB |

After every case, the suite asserts no `awffc-*` namespaces or Firecracker
interface residue remain. See [Firecracker integration (preview)](../docs/firecracker-integration.md#part-14--ci-workflow)
for the current automation status and local validation details.

## Cloud Hypervisor preview integration tests

The Cloud Hypervisor backend has its own separate CI workflow
(`test-cloud-hypervisor.yml`), based on the retained Firecracker test
conventions but scoped to Cloud Hypervisor paths and **GitHub-hosted Ubuntu
x86_64 runners only** (self-hosted runners are explicitly rejected).

**Trigger:** `workflow_dispatch`, or pull request open/synchronize/reopen/label
scoped to `guest/cloud-hypervisor/**`, `src/cloud-hypervisor/**`,
`src/microvm/**`, and the related scripts/docs/workflow files. Only label
`cloud-hypervisor-kvm` enables the live job. It does **not** run on push or
schedule.

**Build job** (`ubuntu-24.04`): Builds deterministic guest artifacts — Cloud
Hypervisor v53.0 binary, the same pinned Linux 6.1.141 kernel config
Firecracker uses, BusyBox 1.36.1 rootfs, and the shared AWF guest supervisor —
from pinned, SHA-256 verified sources. Attests provenance. Uploads as a
7-day workflow artifact (`cloud-hypervisor-test-x86_64`).

**Live job** (`ubuntu-24.04`): Downloads the build artifact, verifies all four
SHA-256 digests plus GitHub-hosted-only host eligibility (`GITHUB_ACTIONS`,
`RUNNER_ENVIRONMENT`, `ImageOS`) and Landlock LSM availability, then runs the
live smoke/security suite. The preflight requires usable KVM and fails closed
if `/dev/kvm` or another required host capability is unavailable.

Live assertions (see `scripts/ci/cloud-hypervisor-live-smoke.sh`) reproduce
Firecracker's full 13-case contract verbatim, plus two Cloud Hypervisor-only
cases:

| Case | What it proves |
|------|---------------|
| `allowed-https` | Allowed domains reach the internet through Squid |
| `blocked-domain` | Non-allowlisted domains are blocked |
| `direct-egress` | Bypassing proxy env vars does not enable direct egress |
| `arbitrary-tcp` | Raw TCP to arbitrary IPs is blocked |
| `dns-denial` | Direct DNS (8.8.8.8:53) is blocked from the guest |
| `metadata-denial` | Instance metadata IP (`169.254.169.254`) is unreachable |
| `api-proxy-reflect` | API proxy `/reflect` reachable; secret sentinel not in output |
| `workspace-copyback` | Guest file writes, permission changes, and symlinks survive copy-back |
| `exit-code` | Agent exit code propagates faithfully (37 → 37) |
| `timeout-124` | Timed-out agent exits 124 |
| `device-assumptions` **(CH-only)** | `/dev/vda`/`/dev/vdb` and `eth0` guest device assumptions hold |
| `partial-start-cleanup` | Corrupt rootfs causes clean failure; no residue |
| `cancellation` | `SIGTERM` cleans up residue within a non-flaky time ceiling; exits 143 |
| `keep` | `--keep-containers` preserves namespace/run-directory; diagnostics ≤1 MiB |
| `security-assertions` **(CH-only)** | Live jailer-replacement boundary: non-root uid, `CapEff` limited to `CAP_NET_ADMIN` alone, `no_new_privs`, active seccomp filter, per-run cgroup membership/bounded memory, `landlock_enable` + exactly-minimal disk/net/vsock topology via `vm.info` |

After every case, the suite asserts no `awffc-*` namespaces, `fch*`/`fcn*`/`fct*`
interfaces (shared naming with Firecracker), `awf-cloud-hypervisor` cgroup
entries, or `cloud-hypervisor` processes remain. The secret sentinel
(`awf-cloud-hypervisor-real-secret-do-not-expose`, distinct from
Firecracker's) is scanned for in the same way. See
[Cloud Hypervisor integration (preview)](../docs/cloud-hypervisor-foundation.md#part-14--ci-workflow)
for the full CI workflow specification.
