# Troubleshooting

## Domain Access Issues

### Domain is Blocked

**Problem:** Request to allowed domain is being blocked

**Solution:**
1. Check domain spelling in `--allow-domains`
2. Add subdomains if needed (e.g., `api.github.com` in addition to `github.com`)
3. Enable debug logging to see Squid access logs:
   ```bash
   sudo awf \
     --allow-domains github.com \
     --log-level debug \
     'your-command'
   ```
4. Check Squid logs for blocked requests:
   ```bash
   sudo grep "TCP_DENIED" /tmp/squid-logs-<timestamp>/access.log
   ```

## Container Issues

### Container Won't Start

**Problem:** Docker Compose fails to start containers

**Solution:**
1. Ensure Docker is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
2. Check for port conflicts (port 3128 must be available):
   ```bash
   netstat -tulpn | grep 3128
   ```
3. Verify Docker Compose is installed:
   ```bash
   docker compose version
   ```
4. Check for orphaned networks:
   ```bash
   docker network ls | grep awf
   ```
   If found, clean them up:
   ```bash
   docker network rm awf-net
   ```

## Self-Hosted Runner Issues

### ARC / DinD Split Filesystem

**Problem:** Bind-mounted files exist on the runner, but AWF containers report `ENOENT` for `/tmp/...` or other mounted paths.

**Cause:** The Docker daemon is running in a DinD sidecar or other split-filesystem setup, so bind mounts resolve against the daemon filesystem instead of the runner filesystem.

**Solution:**
1. Check whether `DOCKER_HOST` points to a non-default socket or `tcp://` endpoint:
   ```bash
   echo "$DOCKER_HOST"
   ```
2. Verify the split with a sentinel probe:
   ```bash
   SENTINEL="/tmp/awf-split-fs-test"
   echo ok > "$SENTINEL"
   docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp alpine sh -lc "ls -l $SENTINEL"
   ```
   If the file is missing in the container, the daemon cannot see the runner filesystem directly.
3. Set a daemon-visible prefix such as:
   ```bash
   awf --docker-host-path-prefix /tmp/gh-aw ...
   ```
4. For stdin JSON/YAML config, use:
   ```json
   {
     "container": {
       "dockerHostPathPrefix": "/tmp/gh-aw"
     }
   }
   ```
5. See [ARC + DinD Configuration](arc-dind.md) for staging options like `chroot.binariesSourcePath` and `dind.stageEngineBinary`.

### Non-Standard Runner Home

**Problem:** Paths under `/home/runner` are wrong on a self-hosted runner, or tools installed under the real `$HOME` are not found.

**Solution:**
1. Confirm the actual runner home:
   ```bash
   echo "$HOME"
   ```
2. If you are passing stdin config, set the real home via `chroot.identity.home`.
3. If the missing tool lives in a runner-managed toolcache, also check whether it was installed under `$HOME/work/_tool` rather than `/opt/hostedtoolcache`.
4. For DinD chroot setups, review [Chroot Mode](chroot-mode.md) and [ARC + DinD Configuration](arc-dind.md) to ensure the runner home and runner-installed binaries are visible inside the chroot.

### IPv6-Disabled Docker and Squid Startup Failures

**Problem:** Squid exits with `FATAL: http_port: IPv6 is not available` or `Bungled squid.conf ... [::]:3128`.

**Solution:**
1. Check Docker's IPv6 state:
   ```bash
   docker info | grep -i ipv6
   ```
2. If the container is still available, inspect the kernel switch inside it:
   ```bash
   docker exec awf-squid cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6
   ```
3. Enable Docker/kernel IPv6 on the host (required with current AWF builds), or use a custom AWF build that removes the `[::]` listener.

### Corporate Upstream Proxy

**Problem:** All outbound traffic fails on a self-hosted runner that must reach the internet through a corporate HTTP proxy.

**Solution:**
1. Check whether the host already exports proxy variables:
   ```bash
   env | grep -i proxy
   ```
2. AWF automatically reads host `https_proxy` / `http_proxy` values and configures Squid `cache_peer` chaining. If auto-detection is ambiguous, set `--upstream-proxy` explicitly.
3. Verify that the generated Squid config includes the upstream proxy:
   ```bash
   docker exec awf-squid grep cache_peer /etc/squid/squid.conf
   ```
4. See [Environment Variables](environment.md#upstream-corporate-proxy-support) for the full upstream-proxy configuration model.

### GHES / GHEC / Data Residency Routing

**Problem:** Copilot auth or `gh` CLI commands fail on enterprise hosts with symptoms such as:
- `none of the git remotes correspond to the GH_HOST environment variable`
- `400 bad request: Authorization header is badly formatted`
- `invalid API key` during `*.ghe.com` token exchange

**Solution:**
1. Verify the GitHub host context:
   ```bash
   echo "$GITHUB_SERVER_URL"
   echo "$GH_HOST"
   ```
2. Ensure AWF is recent enough for your platform, especially for GHES auth-header fixes.
3. If your enterprise setup needs a manual override, set:
   ```bash
   awf --copilot-api-target <enterprise-copilot-endpoint> ...
   ```
4. Review [GitHub Enterprise Configuration](enterprise-configuration.md) for the expected endpoint derivation and allowlist behavior.

## Permission Issues

### iptables Permission Denied

**Problem:** `Permission denied: iptables commands require root privileges`

**Solution:**
- **All commands MUST be run with `sudo`** for host-level iptables manipulation
- Run: `sudo awf --allow-domains ... 'your-command'`
- In GitHub Actions, the runner already has root access (no `sudo` needed)

### DOCKER-USER Chain Missing

**Problem:** `DOCKER-USER chain does not exist`

**Solution:**
- Ensure Docker is properly installed and running
- Docker creates the DOCKER-USER chain automatically
- Verify Docker version is recent (tested on 20.10+):
  ```bash
  docker version
  ```

### Environment Variables Not Preserved

**Problem:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` or other environment variables not available in container

**Solution:**
- Use `sudo -E` to preserve environment variables:
  ```bash
  sudo -E awf --allow-domains ... 'your-command'
  ```
- Verify variables are exported before running:
  ```bash
  export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token"
  echo $GITHUB_TOKEN  # Should print the token
  ```

### Token Caching Issues

**Problem:** Sensitive tokens (GITHUB_TOKEN, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) not being properly cached or cleared

**Solution:**
1. Enable debug logging for the one-shot-token library:
   ```bash
   export AWF_ONE_SHOT_TOKEN_DEBUG=1
   sudo -E awf --allow-domains ... 'your-command'
   ```
2. Check the debug output for:
   - `Initialized with N default token(s)` - Library loaded successfully
   - `Token <NAME> accessed and cached` - Token was read and cached
   - `INFO: Token <NAME> cleared from process environment` - Token removed from /proc/environ
   - `WARNING: Token <NAME> still exposed` - Token cleanup failed (security concern)
3. If tokens are still exposed, check:
   - The token name is in the default protected list (see `containers/agent/one-shot-token/README.md`)
   - Or set `AWF_ONE_SHOT_TOKENS` to explicitly protect custom tokens:
     ```bash
     export AWF_ONE_SHOT_TOKENS="MY_CUSTOM_TOKEN,ANOTHER_TOKEN"
     export AWF_ONE_SHOT_TOKEN_DEBUG=1
     sudo -E awf --allow-domains ... 'your-command'
     ```

**Note:** Debug output goes to stderr. Use `2>&1 | tee debug.log` to capture it.

## MCP Server Issues

### MCP Server Can't Connect

**Problem:** MCP server cannot reach external API

**Solution:**
1. Add MCP server's domain to `--allow-domains`
2. Check if MCP server uses subdomain (e.g., `api.example.com`)
3. Verify DNS resolution is working:
   ```bash
   sudo awf --allow-domains example.com \
     'nslookup api.example.com'
   ```
4. Check Squid logs for blocked requests:
   ```bash
   sudo grep "api.example.com" /tmp/squid-logs-<timestamp>/access.log
   ```

### MCP Tools Not Available

**Problem:** MCP tools not showing up in Copilot CLI

**Solution:**
1. Verify MCP config has `"tools": ["*"]` field:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.copilot/mcp-config.json
   ```
2. Ensure `--allow-tool` flag matches MCP server name:
   ```bash
   # MCP config has "github" as server name
   copilot --allow-tool github --prompt "..."
   ```
3. Check if built-in MCP is disabled:
   ```bash
   copilot --disable-builtin-mcps --prompt "..."
   ```
4. Review agent logs for MCP connection errors:
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/awf-agent-logs-<timestamp>/*.log
   ```

## Java / Maven / Gradle Issues

### How AWF Handles Java Proxy

AWF automatically sets `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` with `-Dhttp.proxyHost`, `-Dhttp.proxyPort`, `-Dhttps.proxyHost`, `-Dhttps.proxyPort`, and `-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts` inside the agent container. This works for most Java tools that read standard JVM system properties, including Gradle and SBT.

### Maven Requires Extra Configuration

**Problem:** Maven builds fail with network errors even though the domain is in `--allow-domains`

**Cause:** Maven's HTTP transport (Apache HttpClient / Maven Resolver) ignores Java system properties for proxy configuration. Unlike Gradle and most other Java tools, Maven does **not** read `-DproxyHost`/`-DproxyPort` from `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`.

**Solution:** Create `~/.m2/settings.xml` with proxy configuration before running Maven:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.m2
cat > ~/.m2/settings.xml << EOF
<settings>
  <proxies>
    <proxy>
      <id>awf-http</id><active>true</active><protocol>http</protocol>
      <host>${SQUID_PROXY_HOST}</host><port>${SQUID_PROXY_PORT}</port>
    </proxy>
    <proxy>
      <id>awf-https</id><active>true</active><protocol>https</protocol>
      <host>${SQUID_PROXY_HOST}</host><port>${SQUID_PROXY_PORT}</port>
    </proxy>
  </proxies>
</settings>
EOF
```

The `SQUID_PROXY_HOST` and `SQUID_PROXY_PORT` environment variables are automatically set by AWF in the agent container.

For agentic workflows, add this as a setup step in the workflow `.md` file so the agent creates the file before running Maven commands.

### Gradle Works Automatically

Gradle reads JVM system properties via `ProxySelector.getDefault()`, so the `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable set by AWF is sufficient. No extra configuration is needed for Gradle builds.

### Why This Is Needed

AWF uses a forward proxy (Squid) for HTTPS egress control rather than transparent interception. This means tools must be proxy-aware:

- **Most tools**: Use `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables (set automatically by AWF)
- **Java tools**: Use `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` with JVM system properties (set automatically by AWF)
- **Maven**: Requires `~/.m2/settings.xml` (must be configured manually — see above)

## Harness Binary Resolution Issues

### `spawn /usr/local/bin/<tool> ENOENT` (hardcoded absolute paths)

**Problem:** An agentic harness (e.g. the gh-aw Copilot engine) fails with an error like:

```
spawn /usr/local/bin/copilot ENOENT
```

even though the tool is installed and resolvable via `PATH` on the runner.

**Cause:** Some harnesses hardcode an absolute path to the tool binary (e.g.
`/usr/local/bin/copilot`) instead of doing a `PATH` lookup, and their
installer/cache-hit logic can skip creating that file (e.g. a tool-cache hit
short-circuits before the `/usr/local/bin` wrapper is installed). This is a
bug in the harness/installer, not in AWF — but it interacts with how AWF's
agent container mounts the host filesystem:

- AWF's agent container mounts host `/usr` (and therefore `/usr/local`)
  **read-only** at `/host/usr` (chroot mode) so it can't be written to from
  *inside* the container.
- The bind mount is a live view of host `/usr/local/bin`: changes made on the
  **host** (including host-side `pre-agent-steps`) are visible in the sandbox.
- Commands that run *inside* the AWF sandbox still cannot create this symlink,
  because `/usr` is mounted read-only there.

**Automatic mitigation (Copilot CLI):** For Copilot runs, AWF's agent
entrypoint now checks `/usr/local/bin/copilot` at container start. When the
entry is missing, it resolves `copilot` through the chroot `PATH` and the
`$GITHUB_PATH` entries (which is where a warm Copilot CLI tool-cache is
activated) and creates the expected symlink before the command runs. Because
host `/usr` is read-only, AWF stages the symlink in a root-owned directory and
bind-mounts it over the chroot's `/usr/local/bin`, preserving every existing
entry; the host filesystem is never modified. The behavior is driven by the
internal `AWF_ENSURE_USR_LOCAL_BIN` environment variable (comma-separated
binary names) and is a no-op when the path already exists.

**Workarounds (other tools):**

1. **Host-side symlink before invoking `awf`** — if you control the step
   immediately before AWF starts the sandbox, create the missing binary on
   the *host* filesystem so it is present when AWF takes its `/usr` bind
   mount:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -sf "$(command -v copilot)" /usr/local/bin/copilot
   sudo awf --allow-domains ... -- <command>
   ```
   Doing this from *inside* the sandboxed command will not work, since
   `/usr/local` is read-only once the container is running.
2. **`chroot.binariesSourcePath`** — point this config option at a host
   directory containing the tool binary (or a symlink to it). AWF mounts it
   read-only at `/host/tmp/awf-runner-bin` and `entrypoint.sh` prepends it to
   the chrooted `PATH`. This fixes `PATH`-based lookups, but does **not**
   help harnesses that spawn a hardcoded absolute path (like
   `/usr/local/bin/copilot`) rather than resolving the binary via `PATH`. See
   [docs/awf-config-spec.md](awf-config-spec.md) §`chroot.binariesSourcePath`.
3. **Fix upstream** — the durable fix is in the harness/installer itself
   (e.g. gh-aw's `install_copilot_cli.sh` / `pkg/constants/constants.go`), so
   that it always resolves the binary via `PATH` or always populates the
   hardcoded path, even on a tool-cache hit. Track/coordinate with the
   upstream project for the permanent fix.

## Log Analysis

### Finding Blocked Domains

```bash
# View all blocked domains
sudo grep "TCP_DENIED" /tmp/squid-logs-<timestamp>/access.log | awk '{print $3}' | sort -u

# Count blocked attempts by domain
sudo grep "TCP_DENIED" /tmp/squid-logs-<timestamp>/access.log | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Checking Container Logs

**While containers are running** (with `--keep-containers`):
```bash
docker logs awf-agent
docker logs awf-squid
```

**After command completes:**
```bash
# Agent logs (includes GitHub Copilot CLI logs)
cat /tmp/awf-agent-logs-<timestamp>/*.log

# Squid logs (requires sudo)
sudo cat /tmp/squid-logs-<timestamp>/access.log
```

### Checking iptables Logs

Blocked UDP and non-standard protocols are logged to the **host** kernel log via the DOCKER-USER chain:

```bash
# From host (requires sudo)
sudo dmesg | grep FW_BLOCKED
```

## Network Issues

### DNS Resolution Failures

**Problem:** Domains cannot be resolved

**Solution:**
1. Verify DNS is allowed in iptables rules (should be automatic)
2. Test DNS resolution:
   ```bash
   sudo awf --allow-domains example.com \
     'nslookup example.com'
   ```
3. Check if DNS servers are reachable:
   ```bash
   sudo awf --allow-domains example.com \
     'cat /etc/resolv.conf'
   ```

### Connection Timeouts

**Problem:** Requests timeout instead of being blocked

**Solution:**
1. Check if Squid proxy is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep awf-squid
   ```
2. Verify iptables rules are applied:
   ```bash
   docker exec awf-agent iptables -t nat -L -n -v
   ```
3. Increase timeout in your command:
   ```bash
   sudo awf --allow-domains github.com \
     'curl --max-time 30 https://api.github.com'
   ```

### Proxy Connection Refused

**Problem:** `curl: (7) Failed to connect to 172.30.0.10 port 3128`

**Solution:**
1. Ensure Squid container is healthy:
   ```bash
   docker ps --filter name=awf-squid
   # Should show "healthy" status
   ```
2. Check Squid logs for errors:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /tmp/squid-logs-<timestamp>/cache.log
   ```
3. Verify network connectivity:
   ```bash
   docker exec awf-agent ping -c 3 172.30.0.10
   ```

## Cleanup Issues

### Orphaned Containers

**Problem:** Containers remain after command exits

**Solution:**
1. Manually clean up containers:
   ```bash
   docker rm -f awf-agent awf-squid
   ```
2. Clean up networks:
   ```bash
   docker network rm awf-net
   ```
3. Use cleanup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/ci/cleanup.sh
   ```

### Disk Space Issues

**Problem:** `/tmp` directory filling up with logs

**Solution:**
1. Manually remove old logs:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /tmp/awf-agent-logs-*
   rm -rf /tmp/squid-logs-*
   rm -rf /tmp/awf-*
   ```
2. Empty log directories are not preserved automatically
3. Use `--keep-containers` only when needed for debugging

## GitHub Actions Specific Issues

### Workflow Timeout

**Problem:** GitHub Actions workflow times out

**Solution:**
1. Increase timeout in workflow:
   ```yaml
   timeout-minutes: 15
   ```
2. Use `timeout` command in script:
   ```bash
   timeout 60s awf --allow-domains ... 'your-command'
   ```

### Cleanup Not Running

**Problem:** Cleanup step not executing in workflow

**Solution:**
1. Ensure cleanup step has `if: always()`:
   ```yaml
   - name: Cleanup
     if: always()
     run: ./scripts/ci/cleanup.sh
   ```
2. Add pre-test cleanup to prevent resource accumulation:
   ```yaml
   - name: Pre-test cleanup
     run: ./scripts/ci/cleanup.sh
   ```

### Network Pool Exhaustion

**Problem:** `Pool overlaps with other one on this address space`

**Solution:**
1. Run cleanup before tests:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/ci/cleanup.sh
   ```
2. Add network pruning:
   ```bash
   docker network prune -f
   ```
3. This is why pre-test cleanup is critical in CI/CD

## SSL Bump Issues

### Certificate Validation Failures

**Problem:** Agent reports SSL/TLS certificate errors when `--ssl-bump` is enabled

**Solution:**
1. Verify the CA was injected into the trust store:
   ```bash
   docker exec awf-agent ls -la /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
   docker exec awf-agent cat /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt | grep -A1 "AWF Session CA"
   ```
2. Check if the application uses certificate pinning (incompatible with SSL Bump)
3. For Node.js applications, verify NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS is not overriding:
   ```bash
   docker exec awf-agent printenv | grep -i cert
   ```

### URL Patterns Not Matching

**Problem:** Allowed URL patterns are being blocked with `--ssl-bump`

**Solution:**
1. Enable debug logging to see pattern matching:
   ```bash
   sudo awf --log-level debug --ssl-bump --allow-urls "..." 'your-command'
   ```
2. Check the exact URL format in Squid logs:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /tmp/squid-logs-*/access.log | grep your-domain
   ```
3. Ensure patterns include the scheme:
   ```bash
   # ✗ Wrong: github.com/myorg/*
   # ✓ Correct: https://github.com/myorg/*
   ```

### Application Fails with Certificate Pinning

**Problem:** Application refuses to connect due to certificate pinning

**Solution:**
- Applications with certificate pinning are incompatible with SSL Bump
- Use domain-only filtering without `--ssl-bump` for these applications:
  ```bash
  sudo awf --allow-domains github.com 'your-pinned-app'
  ```

## Getting More Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Enable debug logging:**
   ```bash
   sudo awf --log-level debug --allow-domains ... 'your-command'
   ```

2. **Keep containers for inspection:**
   ```bash
   sudo awf --keep-containers --allow-domains ... 'your-command'
   ```

3. **Review all logs:**
   - Agent logs: `/tmp/awf-agent-logs-<timestamp>/`
   - Squid logs: `/tmp/squid-logs-<timestamp>/`
   - Container logs: `docker logs awf-agent`

4. **Check documentation:**
   - [Architecture](architecture.md) - Understand how the system works
