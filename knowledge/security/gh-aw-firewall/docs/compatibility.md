# Compatibility

This document outlines the supported Node.js versions, operating systems, and other compatibility information for the Agentic Workflow Firewall.

## Supported Versions

### Node.js

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Node.js 22.x | ✅ Fully Supported | Active LTS (recommended) |
| Node.js 20.x | ✅ Fully Supported | Maintenance LTS (minimum: 20.19.0) |
| Node.js < 20.19 | ❌ Not Supported | Below minimum engine requirement |

The minimum Node.js version is specified in `package.json` under `engines.node: ">=20.19.0"`.

### Ubuntu / Linux

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) | ✅ Fully Supported | `ubuntu-latest` in GitHub Actions |
| Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) | ✅ Fully Supported | LTS, tested in CI |
| Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) | ⚠️ May Work | Not actively tested |
| Other Linux distros | ⚠️ May Work | Docker and iptables required |

**Note:** The agent container is based on Ubuntu 22.04, which ensures consistent behavior regardless of the host OS.

### Docker

| Component | Minimum Version | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Docker Engine | 20.10+ | Required for container networking |
| Docker Compose | v2.0+ | Used for container orchestration |

### GitHub Actions Runners

| Runner | Architecture | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| `ubuntu-latest` | x86_64 | ✅ Fully Supported | Currently Ubuntu 24.04. Primary CI runner. |
| `ubuntu-24.04` | x86_64 | ✅ Fully Supported | Explicit Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble). |
| `ubuntu-22.04` | x86_64 | ✅ Fully Supported | Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) LTS. |
| `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | arm64 | ✅ Fully Supported | Linux ARM64. Docker, AWF, and MCP Gateway all work. |
| `macos-latest` | arm64 | ❌ Not Supported | macOS runners are VMs without nested virtualization — Docker cannot run. See below. |
| `macos-*` (any) | arm64/x86_64 | ❌ Not Supported | Same limitation as above. |
| `windows-*` | x86_64 | ❌ Not Supported | AWF requires Linux iptables and Docker with Linux containers. |

### Why macOS runners are not supported

GitHub-hosted macOS runners are themselves virtual machines (`Apple M1 (Virtual)`) that do not support nested virtualization. AWF requires Docker for the Squid proxy container, agent container, and MCP Gateway — all of which need a Linux VM on macOS. Docker Desktop, colima (with both `vz` and `qemu` VM types), and Apple's `container` tool were all tested and none can provide Docker on these runners. The root cause error is: `Virtualization is not available on this hardware`.

### Architecture

| Architecture | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| x86_64 (amd64) | ✅ Fully Supported | Primary development platform |
| arm64 (aarch64) | ✅ Fully Supported | Tested on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` GitHub Actions runners |

## CI Test Matrix

The project uses a matrix testing strategy to ensure compatibility across different configurations:

### Pull Requests

For faster feedback on pull requests, tests run on a minimal configuration:
- **OS:** `ubuntu-latest`
- **Node.js:** 22

### Main Branch Pushes

Full matrix testing runs on pushes to the main branch:
- **OS:** `ubuntu-22.04`, `ubuntu-latest`
- **Node.js:** 20, 22

This approach balances comprehensive compatibility testing with CI resource efficiency.

## Verifying Compatibility

To check if your environment meets the requirements:

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be v20.19.0 or higher

# Check Docker version
docker --version  # Should be 20.10 or higher

# Check Docker Compose version
docker compose version  # Should be v2.0 or higher

# Check Docker is running
docker info
```

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js Version Too Old

If you see errors about unsupported syntax or modules:

```bash
# Install Node.js 22 using nvm
nvm install 22
nvm use 22

# Or using apt (Ubuntu)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Docker Not Available

If Docker is not available:

```bash
# Install Docker on Ubuntu
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

# Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Start Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

## Firecracker preview host requirements

The Firecracker microVM backend is an **explicit opt-in preview** available only on a
subset of host configurations. It is **not** the default and does **not** fall back to
any other runtime.

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Operating system | **Linux only** — macOS and Windows fail preflight immediately |
| Architecture | x86_64 primary (aarch64 accepted by preflight code; no pre-built aarch64 test artifact) |
| KVM device | `/dev/kvm` must exist and be readable + writable by the workflow user |
| CI runner | GitHub-hosted x64 `ubuntu-24.04` with readable + writable `/dev/kvm` |
| Firecracker version | **v1.16.1 exactly** — enforced at preflight; any other version fails |
| Jailer | Mandatory — the jailer binary must match the Firecracker binary version |
| Docker | Local Unix-socket Docker Engine required; remote Docker hosts rejected |
| Required tools | `ip`, `sysctl`, `nft`, `mke2fs`, `debugfs`, `e2fsck`, `rsync`, `sha256sum`, `timeout`, `docker`, `docker compose` v2, passwordless `sudo` |

See [Firecracker integration (preview)](./firecracker-integration.md) for the complete
prerequisites, artifact policy, and CLI reference.

## Reporting Compatibility Issues

If you encounter compatibility issues with a supported configuration, please:

1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)
2. Search existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall/issues)
3. Open a new issue with:
   - Node.js version (`node --version`)
   - Docker version (`docker --version`)
   - Operating system and version (`cat /etc/os-release`)
   - Full error message and logs
