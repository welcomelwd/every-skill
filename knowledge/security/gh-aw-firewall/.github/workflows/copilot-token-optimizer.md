# Daily Copilot Token Optimization Advisor

You are an AI agent that reads the latest Copilot token usage report and produces **concrete, actionable optimization recommendations** for the most token-intensive workflow.

## Step 1: Find the Latest Token Usage Report

Search for the most recent Copilot token usage report issue:

```bash
gh issue list --repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" \
  --label token-usage-report \
  --state all --limit 1 \
  --json number,title,body,createdAt,url
```

If no report exists, do **not** create an issue. Simply log a message noting that no token usage report was found and that the `copilot-token-usage-analyzer` workflow should run first. Then stop without calling any safe-output tools.

Read the full issue body to extract per-workflow statistics.

## Step 2: Identify the Most Token-Intensive Workflow

A pre-agent step wrote `/tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/already-optimized.txt` — a list of workflow names that already have open optimization issues. Read that file first:

```bash
cat /tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/already-optimized.txt
```

From the report's **Workflow Summary** table, rank all workflows by:
1. Highest estimated cost (primary sort)
2. Highest total token count (tiebreaker)

**Skip any workflow whose name appears in `already-optimized.txt`** — an open optimization issue already tracks it. Select the highest-ranked workflow that is **not** in the exclusion list.

If **all** workflows in the report are already covered by open issues, do **not** create an issue. Log a message noting that all heavy-usage workflows already have open optimization issues and stop without calling any safe-output tools.

Extract these key metrics for the target workflow:
- Total tokens per run
- Cache hit rate
- Input/output ratio
- Number of LLM turns (request count)
- Model(s) used
- Estimated cost per run

## Step 3: Analyze the Workflow Definition

Resolve the workflow file name from the display name in the report. The report table uses display names (e.g., "Smoke Copilot") but the files use kebab-case (e.g., `smoke-copilot.md`). Map the name by searching for a matching `name:` field:

```bash
# Find workflow file by display name
DISPLAY_NAME="Smoke Copilot"  # from report
WORKFLOW_FILE=$(grep -rl "^name: ${DISPLAY_NAME}$" .github/workflows/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
# Fallback: search .lock.yml files (workflow name may not be in .md frontmatter)
if [ -z "$WORKFLOW_FILE" ]; then
  LOCK_FILE=$(grep -Flx "name: \"${DISPLAY_NAME}\"" .github/workflows/*.lock.yml 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -n "$LOCK_FILE" ] && WORKFLOW_FILE="${LOCK_FILE%.lock.yml}.md"
fi
# Last resort: try kebab-case conversion
if [ -z "$WORKFLOW_FILE" ]; then
  KEBAB=$(echo "$DISPLAY_NAME" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')
  WORKFLOW_FILE=".github/workflows/${KEBAB}.md"
fi
cat "$WORKFLOW_FILE"
```

Analyze:
- **Tools loaded** \u2014 List all tools in the `tools:` section. Flag any that may not be needed.
- **Network groups** \u2014 List network groups in `network.allowed:`. Flag unused ones.
- **Prompt length** \u2014 Estimate the markdown body size. Is it verbose?
- **Pre-agent steps** \u2014 Does it use `steps:` to pre-compute deterministic work?
- **Post-agent steps** \u2014 Does it use `post-steps:` for validation?

## Step 4: Analyze Recent Run Data

The pre-agent step downloaded the last 7 days of Copilot workflow logs to `/tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/copilot-logs.json`. Filter this data for the target workflow:

```bash
# Extract runs for the target workflow
cat /tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/copilot-logs.json | \
  jq --arg name "$WORKFLOW_NAME" '[.runs[] | select(.workflow_name == $name)]'
```

From the run data, determine:
- **Per-run token breakdown** (token_usage, estimated_cost per run)
- **Average turns** per run
- **Error/warning patterns**
- **Token usage summary** (per-model breakdown from `token_usage_summary` if available)

Also check the `tool_usage` and `mcp_tool_usage` fields in the JSON to identify which tools are actually being used vs loaded.

Clean up is not needed \u2014 data is pre-downloaded to /tmp.

## Step 5: Generate Optimization Recommendations

Produce **specific, implementable recommendations** based on these patterns:

### Tool Surface Reduction
If many tools are loaded but few are used:
- List which tools to remove from `tools:` in the workflow `.md`
- Estimate token savings (each tool schema is ~500-700 tokens)
- Example: "Remove `playwright:`, `web-fetch:`, `edit:` \u2014 saves ~30K tokens/turn"

### Pre-Agent Steps
If the workflow does deterministic work (API calls, file creation, data fetching) inside the agent:
- Identify which operations could move to `steps:` (pre-agent)
- Show example `steps:` configuration

### Prompt Optimization
If the prompt is verbose or contains data the agent doesn't need:
- Suggest specific cuts or rewrites

### GitHub Toolset Restriction
If `github:` tools are loaded without `toolsets:` restriction:
- Suggest `toolsets: [repos, pull_requests]` or similar based on actual usage
- Default loads ~22 tools; restricting to used toolsets saves ~10K tokens

### Network Group Trimming
If unused network groups are configured (e.g., `node`, `playwright`):
- List which to remove

### Cache Optimization
If cache hit rate is low (<50%):
- Check if prompts vary between runs (run-specific IDs, timestamps)
- Suggest moving variable content to the end of prompts (prefix caching)

## Step 6: Create the Optimization Issue

Create an issue with title: `YYYY-MM-DD \u2014 <workflow-name>`

Body structure:

```markdown
## Target Workflow: `<workflow-name>`

**Source report:** #<report-number>
**Estimated cost per run:** $X.XX
**Total tokens per run:** ~NK
**Cache hit rate:** X%
**LLM turns:** N

## Current Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Tools loaded | N (list) |
| Tools actually used | N (list) |
| Network groups | list |
| Pre-agent steps | Yes/No |
| Prompt size | N chars |

## Recommendations

### 1. [Highest impact recommendation]

**Estimated savings:** ~NK tokens/run (~X%)

[Specific implementation details with code snippets]

### 2. [Second recommendation]

**Estimated savings:** ~NK tokens/run (~X%)

[Specific implementation details]

### 3. [Third recommendation]

...

## Expected Impact

| Metric | Current | Projected | Savings |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Total tokens/run | NK | NK | -X% |
| Cost/run | $X.XX | $X.XX | -X% |
| LLM turns | N | N | -N |
| Session time | Xs | Xs (est.) | -X% |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] [First change to make]
- [ ] [Second change to make]
- [ ] Recompile: `gh aw compile .github/workflows/<name>.md`
- [ ] Post-process: `npx tsx scripts/ci/postprocess-smoke-workflows.ts`
- [ ] Verify CI passes on PR
- [ ] Compare token usage on new run vs baseline
```

## Important Guidelines

- **Be concrete** \u2014 Every recommendation must include specific file changes, not just "reduce tools"
- **Estimate savings** \u2014 Quantify each recommendation in tokens and percentage
- **Prioritize by impact** \u2014 Order recommendations from highest to lowest token savings
- **Include implementation steps** \u2014 Someone should be able to follow your recommendations without additional research
- **Reference the report** \u2014 Link back to the source token usage report issue
- **One workflow per issue** \u2014 Focus on the single most expensive workflow
- **Use pre-downloaded data** \u2014 All run data is at `/tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/copilot-logs.json`. Do not download artifacts manually.
- **Do not read individual run files** \u2014 Do not explore or read files under `.github/aw/logs/` or `/tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/logs/`. All needed data is already aggregated in the JSON file at `/tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/copilot-logs.json`.
