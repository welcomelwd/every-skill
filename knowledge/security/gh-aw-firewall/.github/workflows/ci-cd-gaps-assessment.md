# CI/CD Pipelines and Integration Tests Gap Assessment

You are an AI agent tasked with analyzing CI/CD pipelines and integration tests in this repository to identify gaps in PR quality measurement.

## Pre-fetched Data

All data is pre-fetched in `/tmp/gh-aw/ci-assessment/`. **Read from these files first — do not call GitHub tools for data already here:**

- `workflows.json` — all registered GitHub Actions workflows
- `recent-runs.json` — last 50 workflow runs
- `pr-runs.json` — last 30 PR-triggered runs
- `run-stats.json` — aggregated success/failure statistics
- `pr-workflow-files.txt` — `.github/workflows/*.yml` files with `pull_request` trigger

## Your Task

1. **Read pre-fetched data** using `cat /tmp/gh-aw/ci-assessment/<file>`.
2. **Assess Current CI/CD Coverage**:
   - What checks run on PRs (linting, testing, building, security scans)?
   - Are integration tests present and what is their scope?
3. **Identify Gaps in PR Quality Measurement**:
   - Missing test coverage checks
   - Missing code quality gates (linting, formatting, type checking)
   - Lack of security scanning (dependency vulnerabilities, code scanning)
   - No performance regression testing
   - Insufficient integration or end-to-end testing
   - Missing required status checks
4. **Analyze run-stats.json** for success/failure patterns.

## Output

Create a discussion with these sections:

### 📊 Current CI/CD Pipeline Status
Summarize workflows and their recent health from `run-stats.json`.

### ✅ Existing Quality Gates
List the checks and tests that currently run on PRs.

### 🔍 Identified Gaps
Prioritized gaps: **High** (address immediately) / **Medium** (significant improvement) / **Low** (nice-to-have).

### 📋 Actionable Recommendations
For each gap: description, recommended solution, complexity (Low/Medium/High), expected impact.

### 📈 Metrics Summary
Workflow count, recent success/failure rates, PR check coverage.

Keep the report concise and actionable.
