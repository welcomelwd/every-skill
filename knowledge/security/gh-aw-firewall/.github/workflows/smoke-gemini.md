# Smoke Test: Gemini Engine Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

> Use `perPage: 2` when listing PRs.

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in ${{ github.repository }}
2. **GitHub.com Connectivity**: Use bash to run `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 10 https://github.com` and verify the HTTP status is 200 or 301
3. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-gemini-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Gemini at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
4. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)

## Output

**If triggered by a pull request**, add a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) to the current pull request with:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass, add the label `smoke-gemini` to the pull request.

**If triggered by workflow_dispatch or schedule** (no PR context), use a noop safe output to report the test results summary instead. Do NOT attempt to add comments or labels when there is no pull request.
