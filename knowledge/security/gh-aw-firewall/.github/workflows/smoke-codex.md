# Smoke Test: Codex Engine Validation

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Test Requirements

1. **GitHub MCP Testing**: Review the last 2 merged pull requests in `__GH_AW_GITHUB_REPOSITORY__`
2. **Safe Inputs GH CLI Testing**: Use the `safeinputs-gh` tool to query 2 pull requests from `__GH_AW_GITHUB_REPOSITORY__` (use args: `pr list --repo __GH_AW_GITHUB_REPOSITORY__ --limit 2 --json number,title,author`)
3. **Playwright Testing**: Use the playwright tools to navigate to https://github.com and verify the page title contains "GitHub" (do NOT try to install playwright - use the provided MCP tools)
4. **File Writing Testing**: Create a test file `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-test-codex-${{ github.run_id }}.txt` with content "Smoke test passed for Codex at $(date)" (create the directory if it doesn't exist)
5. **Bash Tool Testing**: Execute bash commands to verify file creation was successful (use `cat` to read the file back)
6. **Discussion Interaction Testing**: 
   - Use the `github-discussion-query` safe-input tool with params: `limit=1, jq=".[0]"` to get the latest discussion from `__GH_AW_GITHUB_REPOSITORY__`
   - Extract the discussion number from the result (e.g., if the result is `{"number": 123, "title": "...", ...}`, extract 123) and validate it is a positive integer (>0)
   - Only if a valid discussion number exists, use the `add_comment` tool with `discussion_number: <extracted_number>` to add a mystical, oracle-themed comment stating that the smoke test agent was here
   - If no valid discussion number is available, skip the discussion comment and continue (do not call `add_comment` with empty or null targets)
8. **Build AWF**: Run `npm ci && npm run build` to verify the agent can successfully build the AWF project. If the command fails, mark this test as ❌ and report the failure.

## Output

**If triggered by a pull request**, call `add_comment` to post a brief comment (max 5-10 lines) on the current pull request (this is validated by the post-step check) containing:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If step 7 produced a valid discussion number (>0), use the `add_comment` tool to add a **mystical oracle-themed comment** to that discussion - be creative and use mystical language like "🔮 The ancient spirits stir..."

If all tests pass on a pull request trigger:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-codex` to the pull request

**If triggered by workflow_dispatch or schedule** (no PR context), call `noop` with a concise PASS/FAIL summary instead. Do NOT attempt to add pull request comments or labels when there is no pull request.
