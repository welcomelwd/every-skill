    # the agent container — AWF then forwards it to the api-proxy sidecar and

# Smoke Test: Copilot BYOK (Direct) Mode

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Purpose

This smoke test validates that Copilot CLI runs in **direct BYOK mode** — triggered by `COPILOT_PROVIDER_API_KEY` being set on the workflow side. AWF forwards that key to the api-proxy sidecar and injects a placeholder into the agent. Inference requests are routed through the api-proxy sidecar to `api.githubcopilot.com`, authenticated with the real key held by the sidecar. The agent only sees a dummy placeholder credential. The sibling `smoke-copilot` workflow covers the parallel `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` BYOK path.

## Pre-Computed Test Results

The following tests were already executed in a deterministic pre-agent step. Your job is to verify the results and produce the summary comment.

### 1. GitHub MCP Testing
Verify MCP connectivity by calling `github-list_pull_requests` for ${{ github.repository }} (limit 2, state merged). Confirm the result matches the pre-fetched data below.

### 2. GitHub.com Connectivity
Check the HTTP code in **Pre-Fetched Data** below.
✅ if HTTP 200 or 301, ❌ otherwise.

### 3. File Write/Read Test
Run `cat` on the file path from **Pre-Fetched Data** below to confirm it exists.

### 4. BYOK Inference Test
You are running in direct BYOK mode right now. The fact that you can read this prompt and respond means the BYOK inference path (agent → api-proxy sidecar → api.githubcopilot.com) is working. Confirm ✅.

## Output

**If triggered by a pull request**, call `add_comment` to post a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) on the current pull request with:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Note: "Running in direct BYOK mode (COPILOT_PROVIDER_API_KEY) via api-proxy → api.githubcopilot.com"
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL
- Mention the pull request author and any assignees

If all tests pass on a pull request trigger:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-copilot-byok` to the pull request

**If triggered by workflow_dispatch or schedule** (no PR context), call `noop` with a concise PASS/FAIL summary instead. Do NOT attempt to add pull request comments or labels when there is no pull request.
