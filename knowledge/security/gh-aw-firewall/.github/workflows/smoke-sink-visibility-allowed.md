# Smoke Test: Sink Visibility — Allowed (private-to-public-flows: allow)

This test verifies that `private-to-public-flows: allow` correctly disables
MCP Gateway sink-visibility enforcement, permitting reads from a private
repository.

Target private repo: `github/agentic-workflows`

**IMPORTANT: All access to github/agentic-workflows must be READ-ONLY.
Never create, update, or delete anything in that repository.**

## Test 1 — gh CLI (mcpg proxy mode)

Run the following bash command and capture the exit code and output:

```bash
gh repo view github/agentic-workflows --json name 2>&1; echo "EXIT_CODE=$?"
```

**Expected**: The command should SUCCEED (exit code 0, returning the repo name).

## Test 2 — GitHub MCP tools (mcpg gateway mode)

Call the MCP tool `get_file_contents` to read the root path (`/`) of
`github/agentic-workflows`:
- owner: `github`
- repo: `agentic-workflows`
- path: `/`

**Expected**: The MCP call should SUCCEED, returning a directory listing.

## Report

Summarize the results:

| Test | Method | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | gh CLI (proxy mode) | ALLOWED | ... | ✅/❌ |
| 2 | MCP tools (gateway mode) | ALLOWED | ... | ✅/❌ |

- ✅ = access was correctly allowed (test passed)
- ❌ = access was unexpectedly blocked (test failed — opt-out not working)

Call `noop` with the summary table and overall PASS/FAIL status.
