# Smoke Test: Copilot BYOK (Direct) Mode — Azure OpenAI (Foundry, api-key)

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Purpose

This smoke test validates that Copilot CLI runs in **direct BYOK mode against Azure OpenAI (Foundry) using an api-key** — triggered by `COPILOT_PROVIDER_API_KEY` + `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` being set on the workflow side. AWF forwards both values to the api-proxy sidecar and injects a placeholder into the agent. Inference requests are routed through the api-proxy sidecar to the Foundry endpoint, authenticated with the real api-key held by the sidecar. The agent only sees a dummy placeholder credential. The sibling `smoke-copilot-byok` workflow covers the parallel CAPI (`api.githubcopilot.com`) BYOK path.

## Pre-Computed Test Results

The following tests were already executed in a deterministic pre-agent step. Your job is to verify the results and produce the summary comment.

### 1. GitHub MCP Testing
Verify MCP connectivity via the GitHub MCP tool `github-list_pull_requests` for ${{ github.repository }} (limit 2, state merged).
- If the tool responds successfully, confirm the result matches the Pre-Fetched PR Data below. ✅
- If the tool is unavailable (missing from context), skip the live call and validate the Pre-Fetched PR Data instead. Mark ✅ (pre-fetched data validated). Do **not** call `missing_tool` for this optional skip.
- If the tool is available but the call fails for another reason, mark ❌ and include the error.
Either way, continue to the **Output** section below and follow the required output rules.

### 2. GitHub.com Connectivity
Pre-step result: HTTP ${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_HTTP_CODE }} from github.com.
✅ if HTTP 200 or 301, ❌ otherwise.

### 3. File Write/Read Test
The activation pre-step wrote and read back: "${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_FILE_CONTENT }}" (that file lives on the activation runner, not here). To exercise agent-side file I/O in the sandbox, write a short string to `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/agent-write-test.txt` and `cat` it back with bash. ✅ if the read-back matches.

### 4. BYOK Inference Test
You are running in direct BYOK mode against Azure OpenAI (Foundry) right now, using `o4-mini-aw` via an api-key. The fact that you can read this prompt and respond means the BYOK inference path (agent → api-proxy sidecar → Foundry endpoint) is working. Confirm ✅.

## Pre-Fetched PR Data

```
${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_PR_DATA }}
```

## Output

**If triggered by a pull request**, call `add_comment` to post a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) on the current pull request with:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Note: "Running in direct BYOK mode (COPILOT_PROVIDER_API_KEY + COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL) via api-proxy → Azure OpenAI (Foundry, o4-mini-aw)"
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL
- Mention the pull request author and any assignees

If all tests pass on a pull request trigger:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-copilot-byok-aoai-apikey` to the pull request

**If triggered by workflow_dispatch or schedule** (no PR context), call `noop` with a concise PASS/FAIL summary instead. Do NOT attempt to add pull request comments or labels when there is no pull request.
