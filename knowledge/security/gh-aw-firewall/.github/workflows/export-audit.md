  Workflow triggered weekly (Monday 09:00 UTC) that audits the TypeScript and JavaScript
  surface of the codebase: unused exports, inconsistent naming conventions, circular
  dependencies, and test files importing from incorrect modules. Files actionable issues
  to keep the API surface clean and prevent dead-code accumulation.

# API Surface & Export Audit

Audit `${{ github.repository }}` for dead exports, naming inconsistencies, circular deps, and bad test imports.

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/export-audit-context.md` (pre-computed findings from ts-prune, madge, grep).

**HARD LIMIT: You have at most 6 turns total.** Turn 1: read context + plan. Turns 2–5: verify and file. Turn 6: emit noop or final issue and stop.

**File issues for:**
- `VERIFIED_UNUSED` entries with `used_outside_defining_file=0_files` — use `VERIFIED_UNUSED` directly as pre-confirmed evidence; do not re-verify unless the section is empty
- Naming violations (non-PascalCase type/interface exports)
- Circular deps detected by madge
- Test files importing from `../../` or `dist/`

If `VERIFIED_UNUSED` is empty, fall back to the normal verification flow within the strict command budget.

**Verification budget (max 3 bash commands total):** Verify at most **3 candidates total** (not 5). Run **exactly 1 bash command** per candidate — `grep -rw <symbol> src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -vE "test|index"`. If not confirmed, skip immediately. **Total bash commands for verification: maximum 3** across all phases.

**Duplicate check:** Search `repo:${{ github.repository }} is:issue "[Export Audit] <symbol>" state:all`. Skip if open. Re-file if closed with `completed` reason and still reproducible.

**Issue format:** Title `[Export Audit] <description>`. Body: File, Symbol, Evidence grep, Dead code risk. Max 5 issues. Score ≥ 3: unused public API = 3, circular dep = 4, naming = 2, bad test import = 2, security-critical module = +2.

If the "TypeScript build output" section contains compiler errors, report them and exit without filing.

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/export-audit-context.md` first. It contains the pre-computed sections for exported symbols, unused exports, verified unused exports, circular dependencies, naming issues, test imports, and api-proxy exports.
