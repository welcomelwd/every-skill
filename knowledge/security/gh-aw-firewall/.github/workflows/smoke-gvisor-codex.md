# Smoke Test: gVisor Runtime + Codex Engine

**IMPORTANT: Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Context

This workflow validates that AWF's gVisor runtime (`sandbox.agent.runtime: gvisor`) works correctly with the **Codex engine**. The gVisor install step is handled automatically by the compiler.

## Pre-Computed Test Results

The following tests were already executed in a deterministic pre-agent step. Your job is to verify the results and produce the summary comment.

### 1. gVisor Runtime Verification
Check if the agent container is running under gVisor by inspecting the kernel:

    cat /proc/version 2>/dev/null || echo "Cannot read /proc/version"
    dmesg 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "dmesg not available (expected under gVisor)"

If `/proc/version` contains `gVisor`, mark runtime as **confirmed**; otherwise mark as **unconfirmed**.

### 2. GitHub MCP Testing
Verify MCP connectivity by calling `github-list_pull_requests` for ${{ github.repository }} (limit 1, state merged). Confirm the result matches the pre-fetched data below.

### 3. GitHub.com Connectivity
Pre-step result: HTTP (see `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-http-code.txt`) from github.com.
✅ if HTTP 200 or 301, ❌ otherwise.

### 4. File Write/Read Test
Pre-step wrote and read back: "(see `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-file-content.txt`)"
File path: (see `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-file-path.txt`)
Verify by running `cat` on the file path using bash to confirm it exists.

### 5. Network Isolation Verification
Run `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 5 https://example.com` — this domain is NOT in the allowlist, so it should be blocked (timeout or 403).

## Pre-Fetched PR Data

    (see `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-pr-data.txt`)

## Output (MANDATORY)

**If triggered by a pull request** (check: `${{ github.event_name }}` equals "pull_request"), you MUST call `add_comment` to post a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) on the current pull request with:
- 🦎🔮 gVisor + Codex runtime: confirmed/unconfirmed
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL

If all tests pass on a pull request trigger:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-gvisor-codex` to the pull request

**If triggered by workflow_dispatch** (no PR context), call `noop` with a concise PASS/FAIL summary instead. Do NOT attempt to add pull request comments or labels when there is no pull request.
