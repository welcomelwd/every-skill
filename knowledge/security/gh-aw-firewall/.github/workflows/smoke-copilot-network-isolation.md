# Smoke Test: Copilot Network Isolation Egress Enforcement

This smoke test runs the Copilot engine under the AWF **network-isolation
topology** (`sandbox.agent.sudo: false`, `isolation: true`) and confirms the
Docker-network egress model still enforces the domain allowlist from **inside**
the sandbox.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST call `add_comment` on pull_request triggers.
This is the primary success criterion. Do this FIRST after running the two
egress checks below.**

**Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where
possible. No verbose explanations. Do NOT inspect the `awf` binary, its
`--help`, or its version — just run the two commands and summarize their
output.**

## Egress Checks (run these yourself with bash)

Run both commands using the `bash` tool. They execute inside the isolated
sandbox, so they exercise the real egress enforcement path.

### 1. Allowed domain is reachable

`github.com` is on the allowlist, so this request should succeed with an HTTP
status code:

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "allowed=%{http_code}\n" --max-time 15 https://api.github.com/zen
```

✅ if it prints `allowed=200` (or any HTTP status), ❌ if it errors / times out.

### 2. Non-allowed domain is blocked

`example.com` is **not** on the allowlist, so this request should fail
(non-zero exit / connection error / proxy denial):

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "denied=%{http_code}\n" --max-time 15 https://example.com && \
  echo "UNEXPECTED: example.com was reachable" || \
  echo "OK: example.com was blocked"
```

✅ if it prints `OK: example.com was blocked`, ❌ if it prints `UNEXPECTED`.

## Record the machine-readable verdict

After running BOTH checks, decide the outcome of each:

- `allow=pass` if test 1 printed an HTTP status (curl exit 0); otherwise `allow=fail`.
- `deny=pass` if test 2 printed `OK: example.com was blocked`; otherwise `deny=fail`.

You MUST include this exact machine-readable line (its own line, verbatim
format) inside the body of the safe output you emit below — the post-step
parses it and fails the workflow unless both are `pass`:

```
EGRESS_RESULT allow=<pass|fail> deny=<pass|fail>
```

Report the real observed results — do not hard-code `pass`.

## Pre-Fetched PR Data

```
(see `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/smoke-pr-data.txt`)
```

## Output (MANDATORY)

**If triggered by a pull request** (check: `${{ github.event_name }}` equals
"pull_request"), you MUST call `add_comment` to post a **very brief** comment
(max 5-10 lines) on the current pull request with:
- The `EGRESS_RESULT allow=<pass|fail> deny=<pass|fail>` line (verbatim)
- ✅ or ❌ for the allowed-domain check (test 1)
- ✅ or ❌ for the blocked-domain check (test 2)
- Overall status: PASS (both checks as expected) or FAIL
- Mention the pull request author

If all tests pass on a pull request trigger:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label
  `smoke-copilot-network-isolation` to the pull request

**If triggered by workflow_dispatch or schedule** (no PR context), call `noop`
with a concise PASS/FAIL summary that also includes the
`EGRESS_RESULT allow=<pass|fail> deny=<pass|fail>` line (verbatim).
Do NOT attempt to add pull request comments or labels when there is no pull request.
