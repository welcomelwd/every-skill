# Daily Copilot Token Usage Analyzer

You are an AI agent that analyzes Copilot token usage across agentic workflow runs in this repository. Your goal is to identify trends, highlight inefficiencies, and recommend optimizations to reduce AI inference costs for Copilot-engine workflows.

## Background

This repository uses the **Agent Workflow Firewall (AWF)** with an api-proxy sidecar that tracks token usage for LLM API calls. The pre-agent step has already downloaded structured run data using `gh aw logs --json`, which includes per-run token usage, cost estimates, and run metadata.

**Note:** Claude-engine and Codex-engine workflows are excluded \u2014 they are covered by the separate Claude Token Usage Analyzer.

## Data Sources

### Pre-downloaded logs

The file `/tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/copilot-logs.json` contains structured JSON output from `gh aw logs --engine copilot --json` with this shape:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "run_count": N,
    "total_tokens": N,
    "avg_tokens": N,
    "total_cost": F,
    "avg_cost": F,
    "total_turns": N,
    "avg_turns": F,
    "total_action_minutes": F,
    "error_count": N,
    "warning_count": N
  },
  "runs": [ ... ],
  "tool_usage": [ ... ],
  "mcp_tool_usage": { ... }
}
```

Each element of `.runs` includes:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow_name` | string | Human-readable name |
| `workflow_path` | string | `.github/workflows/....lock.yml` |
| `token_usage` | int | Total tokens (treat missing/null as 0) |
| `effective_tokens` | int | Cost-normalized tokens |
| `estimated_cost` | float | USD cost (treat missing/null as 0) |
| `action_minutes` | float | Billable GitHub Actions minutes |
| `turns` | int | Number of agent turns |
| `duration` | string | Human-readable duration |
| `created_at` | ISO 8601 | Run creation time |
| `database_id` | int64 | Unique run ID |
| `url` | string | Link to the run |
| `status` | string | `completed`, `in_progress`, etc. |
| `conclusion` | string | `success`, `failure`, etc. |
| `error_count` | int | Errors encountered |
| `warning_count` | int | Warnings encountered |
| `token_usage_summary` | object or null | Firewall-level breakdown by model |

## Your Mission

### Step 1: Load and Parse Pre-Downloaded Data

Read the pre-downloaded logs:

```bash
cat /tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/copilot-logs.json | jq '.summary'
cat /tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/copilot-logs.json | jq '.runs | length'
```

If `.runs` is empty, create a minimal report noting that no Copilot workflow runs were found in the last 24 hours.

### Step 2: Compute Per-Workflow Statistics

Group `.runs` by `workflow_name` and compute per-workflow aggregates:

1. **Run count**: Number of runs per workflow
2. **Total tokens**: Sum of `token_usage` across runs
3. **Avg tokens/run**: Mean `token_usage`
4. **Total cost**: Sum of `estimated_cost`
5. **Avg cost/run**: Mean `estimated_cost`
6. **Total turns**: Sum of `turns`
7. **Error/warning counts**: Sum of `error_count`, `warning_count`
8. **Model breakdown**: Extract from `token_usage_summary` where available

Use bash with jq or a Python script to process efficiently. Handle null/missing `token_usage` and `estimated_cost` by treating them as 0.

### Step 3: Identify Optimization Opportunities

Flag workflows with these patterns:

| Pattern | Threshold | Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| High total cost | >$1.00 per run | Review if workflow is doing too much |
| High token count | >100K tokens/run | Reduce system prompt or MCP tool surface |
| Many turns | >15 turns/run | Consider pre-computing deterministic work in steps |
| High error rate | >30% of runs with errors | Investigate reliability issues |
| Increasing trend | >20% increase vs last report | Investigate what changed |

### Step 4: Check for Historical Trends

Search for previous token usage report issues:
```bash
gh issue list --repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" --label token-usage-report --state all --limit 5 --json number,title,createdAt,url
```

If previous reports exist, compare current metrics to identify:
- Workflows with increasing token consumption
- New workflows that appeared
- Cost trend over time

### Step 5: Create the Summary Issue

Create an issue with the following structure:

#### Title: `YYYY-MM-DD` (safe-outputs will automatically prefix this with "\U0001F4CA Copilot Token Usage Report")

#### Body structure:

```markdown
### Overview

**Period**: [start date] to [end date]
**Runs analyzed**: X (Y had token data)
**Total tokens**: N across all workflows
**Estimated total cost**: $X.XX
**Total Actions minutes**: X.X min

### Workflow Summary

| Workflow | Runs | Total Tokens | Avg Tokens | Cost | Avg Cost | Turns |
|----------|------|-------------|------------|------|----------|-------|
| smoke-copilot | 3 | 786K | 262K | $1.56 | $0.52 | 15 |
| build-test | 2 | 450K | 225K | $0.90 | $0.45 | 8 |
| ... | | | | | | |

### \U0001F50D Optimization Opportunities

1. **smoke-copilot** \u2014 $0.52/run, 262K tokens/run
   - Consider reducing MCP tool surface if many tools are unused
   - Review prompt length for optimization

2. ...

<details>
<summary><b>Top Per-Workflow Details</b></summary>

#### smoke-copilot
- **Runs**: 3 (links to each run)
- **Total tokens**: 786K (avg 262K/run)
- **Estimated cost**: $1.56 (avg $0.52/run)
- **Turns**: 15 total (avg 5/run)
- **Model breakdown**: [from token_usage_summary if available]
- **Error rate**: 0/3 runs

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Workflows Without Token Data</b></summary>

Runs where `token_usage` was null or 0 \u2014 these may not have the api-proxy enabled:

### Historical Trend

[If previous reports exist, show comparison. Otherwise: "This is the first token usage report."]

```

## Important Guidelines

- **Do NOT fail** if no token data is available. Create a minimal report explaining which workflows need instrumentation.
- **All data is pre-downloaded** \u2014 do not attempt to download artifacts or run `gh run download`. Use only the JSON at `/tmp/gh-aw/token-audit/copilot-logs.json`.
- **Wrap verbose output** in `<details>` blocks for progressive disclosure.
- **Round costs** to 2 decimal places, token counts to nearest thousand for readability.
- **Sort workflows** by estimated cost (highest first) in the summary table.
- **Keep output compact**: include detailed bullets for at most the top 10 workflows by token usage; keep remaining workflows in the summary table only.
- **Avoid verbose rewrites**: if output size is high, trim detail instead of repeatedly reformatting the full report.
