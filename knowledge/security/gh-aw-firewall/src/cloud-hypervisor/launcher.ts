/**
 * Secure host launch-argv construction and resource-confinement helpers for
 * Cloud Hypervisor.
 *
 * Cloud Hypervisor has no jailer-equivalent process (unlike Firecracker), so
 * there is nothing that natively joins a prepared network namespace,
 * chroots, drops capabilities, and execs the VMM as one atomic operation.
 * This module documents and implements the exact replacement boundary AWF
 * uses instead:
 *
 *  1. **Network namespace join** — `ip netns exec <namespace> ...` (the
 *     already-trusted, already-required `ip` tool) execs directly into the
 *     per-run namespace {@link https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html}
 *     without an intermediate fork, so the resulting process keeps the PID
 *     the host process observes.
 *  2. **Privilege drop** — `setpriv --reuid --regid --clear-groups
 *     --no-new-privs --inh-caps=-all --bounding-set=-all` execs the Cloud
 *     Hypervisor binary as the non-root operator uid/gid with an empty
 *     capability bounding set and `no_new_privs` set, before any guest code
 *     runs. This is the same non-root identity Firecracker's jailer targets
 *     (see `resolveJailerIdentity` in `src/firecracker/manager.ts`) and
 *     requires the same operator preconditions (kvm-group membership,
 *     `/dev/kvm` access).
 *  3. **Filesystem confinement** — Cloud Hypervisor has no chroot of its
 *     own, and jailer's userspace chroot+pivot_root cannot be replicated
 *     for a foreign static binary without reimplementing jailer itself.
 *     Instead AWF combines:
 *       - a **private run directory** (mode `0700`, owned by the target
 *         uid/gid) holding only the staged kernel/rootfs, virtio-fs sockets,
 *         and API/vsock sockets — see `CloudHypervisorManager`;
 *       - **Landlock** (`landlock_enable`/`landlock_rules` in the
 *         `vm.create` payload — see {@link computeCloudHypervisorLandlockRules})
 *         restricting the VMM process's own filesystem access to exactly
 *         those paths, enforced by the kernel LSM rather than a userspace
 *         boundary;
 *       - Cloud Hypervisor's own **default seccomp** filter
 *         (`--seccomp true`, its default "kill on violation" mode).
 *     This is a different (kernel-LSM-based) boundary than jailer's chroot,
 *     not a weaker one — it is intentionally documented and covered by
 *     tests instead of silently degrading to "no filesystem confinement".
 *  4. **Resource limits** — a dedicated cgroup (v1 or v2, matching
 *     preflight's detected version) bounding memory and CPU time, created
 *     before launch and assigned by PID immediately after spawn (see
 *     {@link CloudHypervisorCgroup}).
 *
 * No shell is ever invoked: every argv below is passed as a plain array to
 * `execa`, never interpolated into a shell string.

 * exactly two things it needs to configure its own virtio-net TAP device,
 * then exec the pinned Cloud Hypervisor binary with only its API socket
 * configured (the VM itself is created and booted afterwards over that
 * socket, mirroring Firecracker's `--api-sock`-only jailer invocation).
 *
 * The launched process retains exactly one supplementary group: the group
 * that owns `/dev/kvm` (resolved by preflight). A blanket `--clear-groups`
 * would also drop that membership, and since the documented supported
 * setup relies on kvm-group access for the non-root operator identity
 * (see docs/cloud-hypervisor-foundation.md), that would make every real
 * launch fail with EACCES opening `/dev/kvm` even though preflight (which
 * runs as root) passed.
 *
 * It also retains exactly one capability: `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, via the
 * bounding, inheritable, and ambient sets together (ambient capabilities
 * are what let a specific capability survive `execve()` of a plain,
 * non-file-capability-aware binary like `cloud-hypervisor` across a uid
 * change, even under `--no-new-privs`). Cloud Hypervisor's virtio-net
 * backend needs it to finish configuring the already-created,
 * already-owned TAP device (observed live: `vm.boot` otherwise fails with
 * "Failed to read the TAP flags from sysfs: Permission denied", even
 * though the TAP device node itself is owned by the target uid/gid). This
 * is a deliberate, minimal, single-capability exception to an otherwise
 * fully empty capability set — not a broad grant.
