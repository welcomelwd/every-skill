/**
 * Fixes squid log file permissions inside the running container before shutdown.
 *
 * Squid writes logs as its internal proxy user (UID 13). After `docker compose
 * down`, those files on the host are owned by UID 13, and the runner user
 * (e.g. UID 1001) cannot chmod them without sudo. This is especially
 * problematic on ARC/DinD topologies where the docker-based rootless repair in
 * `fixArtifactPermissionsForRootless()` also fails because path translation is
 * not applied to the bind-mount or the squid image is unavailable after compose
 * down with `--pull never`.
 *
 * Running `chmod -R a+rX` as root inside the still-running container fixes the
 * permissions on the bind-mounted log volume before it is unmounted, ensuring
 * that `awf logs summary` and artifact uploads can read the files.
 *
 * Tolerant: silently continues if the container is not running.
