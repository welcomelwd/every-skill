 *
 * Two code paths:
 *
 * - **Network-isolation (topology) mode** (`networkIsolation = true`): creates
 *   an `internal` `awf-net` plus an `awf-ext` bridge. Squid is dual-homed so
 *   it is the sole egress path. Agent DNS is locked to the Docker embedded
 *   resolver because external DNS is unreachable from an internal network.
 *
 * - **Standard iptables mode** (`networkIsolation = false`): uses a pre-created
 *   external `awf-net` managed by `host-iptables.ts`.
