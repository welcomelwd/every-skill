## Coverage Improvements in This PR

### Before
- Overall statement coverage: **35.86%**
- Logger coverage: **25%**
- No coverage infrastructure
- No coverage thresholds
- No HTML reports

### After
- Overall statement coverage: **38.39%** (↑ 2.53%)
- Logger coverage: **100%** (↑ 75%)
- Coverage thresholds enforced
- Multiple report formats (HTML, LCOV, JSON)
- Comprehensive testing documentation

## Test Suite Statistics

- **Total Test Suites:** 6 passed
- **Total Tests:** 135 passed
- **Test Execution Time:** ~4.4 seconds

### Test Files

1. `logger.test.ts` - 33 tests (NEW)
2. `squid-config.test.ts` - 41 tests
3. `cli-workflow.test.ts` - 2 tests (100% coverage)
4. `host-iptables.test.ts` - 12 tests
5. `docker-manager.test.ts` - 23 tests
6. `cli.test.ts` - 24 tests

## Coverage Reports

After running `npm run test:coverage`, reports are available in multiple formats:

- **HTML Report:** `coverage/index.html` (open in browser)
- **LCOV Report:** `coverage/lcov.info` (CI/CD integration)
- **JSON Summary:** `coverage/coverage-summary.json` (programmatic access)
- **Terminal Output:** Displayed after test run

## Areas for Future Improvement

### High Priority

1. **`cli.ts`** (0% coverage)
   - Entry point testing
   - CLI argument parsing
   - Signal handling
   - Error cases

2. **`docker-manager.ts`** (18% coverage)
   - Container lifecycle functions
   - Error handling paths
   - Log parsing logic
   - Cleanup operations

### Medium Priority

3. **`host-iptables.ts`** (83.63% coverage)
   - Edge cases in remaining 16.37%
   - Error conditions
   - Cleanup scenarios

## How to View Coverage

### Terminal

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### HTML Report

```bash
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open coverage/index.html  # Linux
```

### Watch Mode

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Coverage Thresholds

Configured in `jest.config.js`:

```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 30,
    functions: 35,
    lines: 38,
    statements: 38,
  },
}
```

Tests will **fail** if coverage drops below these thresholds.

## Integration with CI/CD

The coverage reports (especially LCOV format) can be integrated with:

- GitHub Actions (via coverage badges)
- Codecov
- Coveralls
- SonarQube
- Other CI/CD tools

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage

- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage/lcov.info
```

## Summary

This PR establishes a solid testing infrastructure for the project with:

✅ **100% coverage** for 3 core modules (logger, squid-config, cli-workflow)
✅ **Coverage thresholds** to prevent regression
✅ **Multiple report formats** for different use cases
✅ **Comprehensive documentation** (TESTING.md)
✅ **All tests passing** (135/135)

The foundation is now in place for continuous improvement of test coverage across the remaining modules.
