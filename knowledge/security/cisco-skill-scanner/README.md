A best-effort security scanner for AI Agent Skills that detects prompt injection, data exfiltration, and malicious code patterns. Combines **pattern-based detection** (YAML + YARA), **LLM-as-a-judge**, and **behavioral dataflow analysis** to maximize detection coverage of probable threats while minimizing false positives.

> **Important:** This scanner provides best-effort detection, not comprehensive or complete coverage. A scan that returns no findings does not guarantee that a skill is free of all threats. See [Scope and Limitations](#scope-and-limitations) below.

Supports [OpenAI Codex Skills](https://openai.github.io/codex/) and [Cursor Agent Skills](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) formats following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io). With `--lenient`, also scans non-standard formats such as Claude Code `.claude/commands/*.md` and flat markdown skill repos.

## Highlights

- **Multi-Engine Detection** - Static analysis, behavioral dataflow, LLM semantic analysis, and cloud-based scanning for layered, best-effort coverage
- **False Positive Filtering** - Meta-analyzer significantly reduces noise while preserving detection capability
- **CI/CD Ready** - SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning, [reusable GitHub Actions workflow](docs/github-actions.md), exit codes for build failures
- **Pre-commit Hook** - [Standard pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) integration to scan skills before every commit
- **Extensible** - Plugin architecture for custom analyzers

## Scope and Limitations

Skill Scanner is a detection tool. It identifies known and probable risk patterns, but it does not certify security.

**Key limitations:**

- **No findings ≠ no risk.** A scan that returns "No findings" indicates that no known threat patterns were detected. It does not guarantee that a skill is secure, benign, or free of vulnerabilities.
- **Coverage is inherently incomplete.** The scanner combines signature-based detection, LLM-based semantic analysis, behavioral dataflow analysis, optional cloud services, and configurable rule packs. While this approach improve coverage, no automated tool can detect every technique, especially novel or zero-day attacks.
- **False positives and false negatives can occur.** Consensus modes and meta-analysis reduce noise, but no configuration eliminates all incorrect classifications. Tune the [scan policy](docs/user-guide/custom-policy-configuration.md) to your risk tolerance.
- **Human review remains essential.** Automated scanning is one component of a defense-in-depth strategy. High-risk or production deployments should pair scanner results with manual code review and/or  threat modeling.

## Quick Start

### Environment Setup (Optional)

```bash
# For LLM analyzer and Meta-analyzer
export SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export SKILL_SCANNER_LLM_MODEL="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

# For VirusTotal binary scanning
export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="your_virustotal_api_key"

# For Cisco AI Defense
export AI_DEFENSE_API_KEY="your_aidefense_api_key"
```

### Interactive Wizard

Not sure which flags to use? Run `skill-scanner` with no arguments to launch the interactive wizard:

```bash
skill-scanner
```

The wizard walks you through selecting a scan target, analyzers, policy, and output format, then shows the assembled command before running it. Great for learning the CLI.

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Scan a single skill (core analyzers: static + bytecode + pipeline)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill

# Scan with behavioral analyzer (dataflow analysis)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-behavioral

# Scan with all engines
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-behavioral --use-llm --use-aidefense

# Scan with meta-analyzer for false positive filtering
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --enable-meta

# Scan with trigger analyzer for vague description checks
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-trigger

# Run LLM analyzer multiple times and keep majority-agreed findings
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --llm-consensus-runs 3

# Scan multiple skills recursively
skill-scanner scan-all /path/to/skills --recursive --use-behavioral

# Scan multiple skills with cross-skill overlap detection
skill-scanner scan-all /path/to/skills --recursive --check-overlap

# Scan a GitHub repository (owner/repo shorthand or full URL)
skill-scanner scan-repo owner/repo
skill-scanner scan-repo https://github.com/owner/repo --use-llm

# Lenient mode: tolerate malformed skills instead of failing
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --lenient
skill-scanner scan-all /path/to/skills --recursive --lenient

# Lenient mode with non-standard skill formats (no SKILL.md required)
skill-scanner scan .claude/commands/deploy --lenient
skill-scanner scan-all .claude/commands --recursive --lenient

# Use a custom metadata filename instead of SKILL.md
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --skill-file README.md

# CI/CD: Fail build if threats found
skill-scanner scan-all ./skills --fail-on-severity high --format sarif --output results.sarif

# Generate interactive HTML report with attack correlation groups
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-llm --enable-meta --format html --output report.html

# Use custom YARA rules
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --custom-rules /path/to/my-rules/

# Use custom taxonomy + threat mapping profiles (JSON/YAML)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --taxonomy /path/to/taxonomy.json --threat-mapping /path/to/threat_mapping.json

# VirusTotal hash scan with optional unknown-file uploads
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --use-virustotal --vt-upload-files

# Use a scan policy preset (strict, balanced, permissive)
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --policy strict

# Use a custom org policy file
skill-scanner scan /path/to/skill --policy my_org_policy.yaml

# Generate a policy file to customise
skill-scanner generate-policy -o my_org_policy.yaml

# Interactive policy configurator (TUI)
skill-scanner configure-policy
```

Consensus mode keeps a finding only when it appears in more than half of the
configured runs. When those votes disagree on severity, the highest observed
severity wins, independent of response order. Failed runs and successful runs
that omit the finding cast no vote but remain in the denominator. This makes
severity selection stable for majority-agreed findings. It does not make an
individual LLM sample deterministic, and descriptive fields from equal-severity
votes, single-run output, and non-majority findings can still vary between scans.

**LLM provider note:** `--llm-provider` currently accepts `anthropic` or `openai`.
For Bedrock, Vertex, Azure, Gemini, and other LiteLLM backends, set provider-specific model strings and environment variables (see [LLM Analyzer docs](docs/architecture/analyzers/llm-analyzer.md)).

### Python SDK

```python
from skill_scanner import SkillScanner
from skill_scanner.core.analyzers import BehavioralAnalyzer

# Create scanner with analyzers
scanner = SkillScanner(analyzers=[
    BehavioralAnalyzer(),
])

# Scan a skill
result = scanner.scan_skill("/path/to/skill")

print(f"Findings: {len(result.findings)}")
print(f"Max severity: {result.max_severity}")

# Note: is_safe indicates no HIGH/CRITICAL findings were detected.
# It does not guarantee the skill is free of all risk.
if not result.is_safe:
    print("Issues detected -- review findings before deployment")
```

---

## GitHub Actions

Scan skills automatically on every push or PR using the [reusable workflow](docs/github-actions.md):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/scan-skills.yml
name: Scan Skills
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: [".cursor/skills/**"]
jobs:
  scan:
    uses: cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner/.github/workflows/scan-skills.yml@main
    with:
      skill_path: .cursor/skills
    permissions:
      security-events: write
      contents: read
```

Results appear as inline annotations in PRs via GitHub Code Scanning. See the [full guide](docs/github-actions.md) for LLM integration, secret configuration, and branch protection setup.

---

## Pre-commit Hook

Scan skills before every commit using the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner
    rev: v1.0.0  # use the latest release tag
    hooks:
      - id: skill-scanner
```

Or install the built-in hook directly:

```bash
skill-scanner-pre-commit --install
```

The hook maps changed files to their nearest `SKILL.md` and scans each affected
skill once. During a normal commit, it reads the staged diff. In CI, compare two
revisions so no staged index is required:

```bash
pre-commit run skill-scanner --from-ref "$BASE_SHA" --to-ref "$HEAD_SHA"
```

Both revisions must exist in the checkout. To scan every configured skill,
invoke the hook directly:

```bash
skill-scanner-pre-commit --scan-all
```

Alternatively, configure `args: [--scan-all]` for the hook in
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
