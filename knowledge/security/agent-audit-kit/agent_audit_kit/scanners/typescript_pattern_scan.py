"""TypeScript / JavaScript dangerous-sink pattern scanner.

This is a **regex pattern scan**, not a real taint analyzer. It looks for
dangerous sinks (eval, child_process.exec, fs.writeFile, SQL template
literals, etc.) in files that appear to implement an MCP server. It does
NOT track flow from user-controlled sources to those sinks.

The module used to be named `typescript_scan.py` and documented as
"TypeScript taint analysis". That overstated what the scanner does; a
real taint tracer would walk the TypeScript AST (via tree-sitter or the
`tsc` compiler API) and model source/sink reachability. A true AST-based
analyzer may ship in a later release in a separate module.

For the Python taint analyzer — which IS AST-based — see
`scanners/taint_analysis.py`.
