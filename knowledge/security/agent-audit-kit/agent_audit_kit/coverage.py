"""OX-disclosed CVE coverage manifest reader + summary helpers.

Powers `aak coverage --source ox`, the README badge endpoint and the
2026-04-28 GitHub Actions workflow that publishes the coverage badge.

The manifest lives at agent_audit_kit/data/ox-cve-manifest.json and is
hand-curated from OX Security's MCP supply-chain disclosure timeline
(license: CC-BY-4.0). Each entry maps a CVE identifier to a list of
covering AAK rule IDs.
