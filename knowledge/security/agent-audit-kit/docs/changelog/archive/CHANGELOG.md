## [0.3.58] - 2026-07-23

### Added — 2026-07-22 CVE-response triage (269 → 270 rules)

- `AAK-MCP-N8N-CVE-2026-65594-001` — n8n MCP Server Trigger OAuth workflow-authz
  bypass (affected 2.27.0–<2.29.8 and 2.30.0–<2.30.1). Two pin arms (one rule)
  for the two fix branches; a distinct fix line from the existing CVE-2026-59207
  pin. Also dispositioned CVE-2026-44192 (Ansible Lightspeed MCP path traversal —
  Red Hat product component, no pinnable artifact / published fix) in
  `CHANGELOG.cves.md`. Clears the `cve-response` backlog for the v0.3.58 gate.

### Added — MCP 2026-07-28 spec-ahead pack + NSA-CSI / OWASP-Agentic crosswalk (265 → 269 rules)

Positioning: the two wedges a free hosted scanner can't match are **offline
determinism** and **standards-provenance compliance evidence** — this ships both,
plus coverage for the 2026-07-28 MCP spec surface before it ratifies. All static,
deterministic, no LLM-graded findings; SARIF shape unchanged.

- **4 spec-ahead rules** (no new CVE anchors):
  - `AAK-MCP-ROUTING-DESYNC-001` — routable `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name` header
    (SEP-2243) used for routing/authorization without cross-checking the JSON-RPC
    body method → header/body desync (confused-deputy). Detector:
    `mcp_routing_desync`.
  - `AAK-MCP-APPS-001` / `AAK-MCP-APPS-002` — MCP Apps (SEP-1865) UI iframe
    rendered without a hardening `sandbox`, and UI content written to a raw-HTML
    sink without sanitization (DOM XSS). Detector: `mcp_apps_ui`.
  - `AAK-TASKS-004` — MCP Tasks (SEP-2663) creation path with no quota /
    concurrency bound → task-flood DoS (distinct from `AAK-TASKS-003`'s
    TTL/cancellation). Detector: `mcp_tasks`.
  - **Not added** (anti-duplicate): the SEP-2468 `iss`-validation surface is
    already shipped as `AAK-OAUTH-006` (RFC 9207); it was deliberately not
    re-added.
- **Standards crosswalk** — a new `report --framework standards-crosswalk`
  artifact and committed doc ([`docs/crosswalk/nsa-csi-owasp-agentic.md`](docs/crosswalk/nsa-csi-owasp-agentic.md))
  mapping every AAK rule to the **NSA MCP Security CSI** control it evidences and
  its **OWASP Agentic Top-10 (2026)** item. Reuses the committed compliance +
  OWASP mappings (no invented mapping), so it can't drift from the reports.
- Version 0.3.57 → 0.3.58.

### Added — 2026-07-21 CVE-response triage (264 → 265 rules)

- `AAK-MCP-STATA-CVE-2026-47708-001` — MCP-for-Stata < 1.17.3 (`log_file_name`
  Stata command injection → `shell`/`python`/`erase`). Fix floor 1.17.3.
- Triaged four more `cve-response` issues without a new rule (see
  `CHANGELOG.cves.md`): CVE-2026-47394 (PraisonAI, class-covered by the existing
  praisonai pin — CVE added to its refs); CVE-2026-50758 (next-ai-draw-io,
  class-covered by the existing `< 0.4.15` pin); CVE-2026-15829 (Go
  googleapis/mcp-toolbox SQLi — not pinnable) and CVE-2026-65056 (mcp-webresearch
  SSRF — class-covered by `AAK-MCP-SSRF-001`, no published fix version to pin).
  Clears the `cve-response` backlog blocking the v0.3.57 release gate.

### Fixed

- **`fix(rules): AAK-MCP-001 no longer flags custom X-*-Key auth headers (#475);
  benign-slice FP rate 50%→0%.`** `AAK-MCP-001` ("Remote MCP server without
  authentication") recognized only `Authorization`/`Bearer`/`X-API-Key`/`Api-Key`
  and missed vendor-prefixed credential headers, so servers authenticating with
  `X-Nefesh-Key` / `X-WR-API-Key` were wrongly flagged. The matcher now
  recognizes the `X-*-Key` / `*-API-Key` / `*-API-Token` / `*-Access-Key` family
  and the x402 `X-PAYMENT` access gate — **value-aware**: a templated/env
  reference (`${API_KEY}`) is a declared scheme (suppressed), while a **hardcoded
  literal** secret in a custom auth header still fires (the credential is exposed
  in the config). The 4 historically recognized exact names stay name-only, so no
  configs newly fire. Measured on the #476 harness: benign-slice HIGH/CRITICAL
  **4 → 1 finding**, adjudicated FP rate **2/4 = 50% → 0/1 = 0%**; full-corpus
  AAK-MCP-001 configs **497 → 492 (−5, 0 newly firing)**. Version 0.3.56 → 0.3.57.

## [0.3.56] - 2026-07-21

### Added — 2026-07-19..20 CVE-response pins (262 → 264 rules)

- `AAK-MCP-WHATSAPP-CVE-2026-46555-001` — whatsapp-mcp < 0.2.1 (unauthenticated
  loopback `whatsapp-bridge` + `media_path` traversal → arbitrary file exfil /
  DNS-rebinding; CVSS 7.7). Fix floor 0.2.1.
- `AAK-MCP-AGENTICMAIL-CVE-2026-57495-001` — AgenticMail bridge-wake indirect
  prompt injection into a `bypassPermissions` agent; one rule, per-package fix
  floors (`@agenticmail/claudecode` ≥ 0.2.39, `/codex` ≥ 0.1.33, `/core` ≥
  0.9.43, `/openclaw` ≥ 0.5.71).
- Triaged three more `cve-response` issues without a new rule (dispositioned in
  `CHANGELOG.cves.md`): CVE-2026-53378 (Linux-kernel DRM leak — out of scope) and
  CVE-2026-55544 / CVE-2026-55550 (NextCRM server-side MCP-tool authorization in a
  self-hosted app — no pinnable dependency or client-config surface). Clearing the
  `cve-response` backlog unblocks the release gate for the v0.3.56 tag.

### Added — frozen, citable MCP security baseline v1.0 (`research/state-of-mcp-2026/baseline.py`)

- A `baseline` command that emits an **immutable, byte-deterministic** research
  snapshot, `mcp-security-baseline-v1.0-2026-07-27`, recording — per config and in
  aggregate — corpus size + collection window, the auth-posture distribution
  (no-auth / bearer / OAuth 2.1 / unknown), transport distribution (stdio / SSE /
  streamable-HTTP), per-rule HIGH/CRITICAL hit counts, and the benign-slice
  HIGH/CRITICAL false-positive rate with its denominator (4/368; 2/4 adjudicated).
  Adds **no** detection rules — reuses `engine.run_scan`, `scoring.compute_score`,
  and the `oauth_misconfig` signals. Offline, no network, no account.
- **Determinism + tamper-evidence:** sorted keys, stable float rounding, and no
  wall-clock in the payload (the collection window is data from the corpus
  manifest). Two runs over the same corpus produce identical bytes; the snapshot
  is fixed under **SHA-256
  `320b43072d930edbc18f050795939dbee3831e4da2f88b3483ea12ec7bb6551f`**, cited in
  the report doc and guarded by `tests/test_mcp_security_baseline.py`.
- **`--compare BASELINE_FILE`** re-scans the corpus and prints a per-dimension
  delta table (absolute + percentage-point) against v1.0, so the post-2026-07-28
  re-measure (scheduled **2026-08-11**) is one command.
- Docs: `docs/research/mcp-security-baseline-v1.0.md` (what was measured, the exact
  collection window, methodology, the FP-rate caveat, the reproducibility caveat,
  and the explicit pre-spec statement), linked from the README research section.
  This is the **pre-2026-07-28-spec** baseline; **no** post-spec comparison is
  claimed until the spec ships.

Version 0.3.55 → 0.3.56.

### Fixed — P0/P1 integration bugs (SARIF upload, lockfile-aware pins)

- **P0 — invalid SARIF `fixes[]` broke `codeql-action/upload-sarif`.** Every
  result emitted a `fixes` object with only `description` and no
  `artifactChanges` (required for a machine-applicable patch), so GitHub rejected
  the whole file. Removed it — the remediation is already in the rule-level
  `help`/`helpMarkdown`; the per-finding copy now goes in a valid `properties`
  bag. The SARIF regression test now enforces the `fixes`-require-`artifactChanges`
  invariant, so this can't recur silently.
- **P0/P1 — the Docker action's SARIF upload was a silent no-op.** `upload-sarif`
  was defined but never used; the action only emits the SARIF (`sarif-file`
  output). It now prints a loud notice and the README/Quick Start document the
  canonical `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` step (with `security-events:
  write`) instead of implying the action uploads.
- **P1 — version-pin CVE rules were false-positive-after-fix on lockfiles.**
  `mcp_cve_pins_2026_07` and `supply_chain`'s Serena pin fired on a lockfile
  reference without parsing the resolved version, so a correct upgrade couldn't
  clear the finding (forcing users to suppress the CVE rule). Added a shared
  lockfile resolver (uv.lock, poetry.lock, Pipfile.lock, package-lock.json,
  pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock) — pins now fire only when the resolved version is
  below the fix floor.

### Fixed — P2 rule-scoping precision (drives the benign-slice FP rate)

Seven critical/high rules were firing on safe or benign patterns. Each fix
narrows the scope so the rule still fires on the real shape but clears the
false positive; each ships a benign-passes regression guard and a
malicious-still-fires guard.

- **AAK-STDIO-001** — an argv-list `subprocess.run(["cmd", tainted], shell=False)`
  is the *safe* form (a tainted element is an argument, not a shell-injection
  vector). It no longer fires on argv lists; only `shell=True` or a
  string/dynamic command does.
- **AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001** — fired on *any* `StdioServerParameters(...)`
  inside a function that merely had a generically-named arg (`config`, `data`).
  Now requires an actual source→sink taint path: a network-controlled value
  (request/env/json, a suspicious param, or a var assigned from one) must flow
  into `command`/`args`. Constant command/args never fire.
- **AAK-AGENT-001** — the catch-all `` `...` `` arm flagged *every* inline-code
  span in an agent-instruction file (`` `cargo build` ``, `` `make` ``,
  `` `npx tsc` `` — dozens of hits per CLAUDE.md). Removed it; genuinely
  dangerous directives (`sh -c`, `rm -rf`, `curl … | bash`) still match.
- **AAK-HOOK-RCE-001** — scanned any `hooks/` directory, catching **React
  hooks** (`src/hooks/use-audit.ts`) whose `` `${event}` `` template literals
  collided with the "hook" keyword. Now scoped to `.claude/` hook scripts, and
  a py/js/ts script's interpolation must reach a shell-exec sink.
- **AAK-TASKS-002 / -003** — fired on any module mentioning a bare `task_id`
  (every Celery/job-queue worker). Now gated on a concrete MCP Tasks primitive
  (a task class/store/manager, SEP-1686, or a `tasks/*` method).
- **AAK-HEALTHCARE-AI-004 / -005** — fired on any markdown using clinical or
  incident words: an ops runbook ("in an emergency, page on-call") tripped the
  crisis rule; a clinical dataset README tripped the disclosure rule. Both now
  require a conversational-agent surface, and 005's trigger is restricted to
  unambiguous self-harm terms (dropping bare "crisis"/"emergency").
- **AAK-INDIA-PII-001** — a bare 12-digit number that coincidentally passes the
  Verhoeff checksum (~1 in 10) fired as an Aadhaar. The unformatted form now
  needs an Aadhaar/UID cue nearby; the grouped `XXXX XXXX XXXX` form still fires
  on its own.

No rule changes (still 262). Version 0.3.53 → 0.3.55.

### Added — benign-slice false-positive benchmark (`benchmarks/false_positive/`)

- A reproducible, offline, deterministic harness that measures and publishes
  AAK's **benign-slice HIGH/CRITICAL false-positive rate** — nobody in this
  category publishes one. Reuses `engine.run_scan` + `rules.builtin.RULES` (no
  scanner/scorer reimplemented) over a **pre-registered 368-config benign slice**
  of the MCP Registry (predicate: official + active + declares an auth mode + not
  in a shipped CVE feed; non-circular — "benign" is registry metadata, not "AAK
  found nothing"). `stats.py` adds a stdlib Wilson interval (no new runtime dep).
- **Measured figure (2026-07-20 run):** 4 HIGH/CRITICAL findings across the 368
  configs (1.1%); hand-adjudicated (single rater) to **2 FP / 1 TP / 1 ambiguous
  → 2/4 = 50% benign-slice HIGH/CRITICAL FP rate, Wilson 95% CI [15%, 85%]**
  (small n, wide interval — stated, not smoothed). Both FPs share one root cause:
  `AAK-MCP-001` doesn't recognise custom API-key headers (`X-*-Key`) as auth —
  filed as #475. Published bad-and-all; that is the credibility value.
- README claim 1 (determinism) extended with the measured-precision line. No rule
  changes (still 262).

## [0.3.52] - 2026-07-19

### Added — State of MCP 2026 report: corpus expanded to 1,374 configs (closes #23)

- **Corpus expansion.** Added the official MCP Registry as a corpus source
  (`research/state-of-mcp-2026/fetch_registry.py` — cursor pagination, cached,
  rate-limited) and combined it with the existing GitHub crawl. Deduped by config
  content: **1,374 distinct configs** (664 crawl + 710 registry latest-version
  servers) — past issue #23's 1,000-server target. Full provenance (name,
  transport, auth mode, source URL, fetch date) is committed in
  `corpus/registry-manifest.json`, so every number is reproducible from the
  manifest.
- **Report harness extended, not duplicated.** `run_report.py` now also emits the
  auth-profile metrics — no-auth %, RFC 9728 PRM %, remote-auth static-credential
  %, transport distribution, rule-family distribution, and the 2026-07-28 /
  2027-07-28 migration-exposure proxies — each with n + denominator + coverage,
  reusing `engine.run_scan` / `scoring.compute_score`. Output is deterministic
  across Python hash seeds (ties break on a stable secondary key).
- **`research/state-of-mcp-2026/REPORT.md`** — the publishable report: **35.1%
  (482/1,374) no-auth, 0% (0/1,374) RFC 9728 discovery, 100% (318/318) inline-auth
  static credential**, 36.0% critical, median grade B. Plus factual Black Hat
  Arsenal + Briefings abstract skeletons (rewrite-before-submit markers, per
  Black Hat's no-LLM-text rule).
- **`make report`** regenerates the numbers from the committed manifest, offline
  and deterministically, so the report is a build artifact that cannot drift.
  Adds no rules (still 262).

### Changed — retire the residual 48h CVE-response SLA wording

- Reconciled the leftover 48h-SLA framing in `CHANGELOG.cves.md` to best-effort,
  no committed SLA (completing the retirement from PR #432). Historical per-CVE
  latency measurements are left as dated facts; only the live-SLA framing (the
  "Open (48h SLA ticking)" heading, the ledger preamble) was reworded. The
  `sla-48h` label is retired — it should be removed from open issues; the release
  gate keys off the `cve-response` label instead.

### Added — AAK-OAUTH-008 (RFC 9728) + `mcp-2026-07-28` auth-profile + readiness report

- **AAK-OAUTH-008** (LOW, MCP_CONFIG) — RFC 9728 Protected-Resource-Metadata
  discovery gap: a remote MCP server config that embeds a static
  `Authorization`/`Bearer`/`auth` credential with no
  `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` discovery path, or server source
  enforcing bearer auth without serving PRM. Detection in `oauth_misconfig` runs
  independent of the client-flow hint so it evaluates `.mcp.json` configs.
- **Anti-duplicate note:** RFC 9207 `iss`-validation was *not* added as a new
  rule — it already ships as `AAK-OAUTH-006`, which was extended to reference the
  2026-07-28 final auth profile (the proposed OAUTH-009 would have duplicated it).
- **`--profile mcp-2026-07-28`** (alias of `--preset`) — one-command auth-profile
  conformance check selecting exactly `AAK-OAUTH-006` (RFC 9207) + `AAK-OAUTH-007`
  (RFC 8707) + `AAK-OAUTH-008` (RFC 9728). New preset YAML + docs + smoke tests.
- **Readiness report** `docs/reports/mcp-2026-07-28-readiness.md` — a dated,
  reproducible scan of 748 public MCP configs (`benchmarks/data/`): **0 reference
  RFC 9728 PRM discovery; 100% of the 36 remote-auth configs hardcode a static
  credential.** Numbers come from a real scan (`scripts/mcp_2026_07_28_readiness.py`,
  deterministic), with explicit limitations (a config corpus can't exercise the
  code-level `iss`/`resource` checks). Rule count 261 → **262**.

### Added — 2026-07-15..17 MCP/agent CVE disclosure-wave pins (7 rules, closes 24 cve-response issues)

CVE-response for a second 2026-07 wave (issues #445–#468). 14 CVEs cluster onto 7
pinnable packages (many share one fix version) → version-pins in
`mcp_cve_pins_2026_07` (now 22 pins); 1 covered by an existing pin; 9 dispositioned
in `CHANGELOG.cves.md` (PHP / GitHub-Action / WordPress ecosystems, no vendor fix,
or no NVD version data). The `mcp` and `n8n-mcp` pins use precise token regexes so
they never trip `fastmcp` / `mcp-text-editor` / `n8n` (also fixed a latent
substring false-positive in the existing `n8n` pin).

- **AAK-MCP-SDK-CVE-2026-52869-001** (HIGH) — `mcp` (MCP Python SDK) >= 1.28.1: session injection + task cross-access + WS no-Origin (CVE-2026-52869/52870/59950).
- **AAK-MCP-9ROUTER-CVE-2026-46339-001** (CRITICAL) — `9router` >= 0.5.2: unauth MCP bridge → RCE (CVE-2026-46339/49353/62312).
- **AAK-MCP-N8NMCP-CVE-2026-54052-001** (CRITICAL) — `n8n-mcp` >= 2.57.4: multi-tenant backup isolation bypass (CVE-2026-54052/55608).
- **AAK-MCP-DBTMCP-CVE-2026-44968-001** (MEDIUM) — `dbt-mcp` >= 1.17.1: dbt-flag injection + tool-arg leakage (CVE-2026-44968/44970/44969).
- **AAK-MCP-APIFY-CVE-2026-46341-001** (MEDIUM) — `@apify/actors-mcp-server` >= 0.9.21: `startsWith()` allowlist bypass SSRF.
- **AAK-MCP-AGENTICFLOW-CVE-2026-58195-001** (HIGH) — `agentic-flow` >= 2.0.14: MCP params → `execSync()` command injection.
- **AAK-MCP-HEALTHOMICS-CVE-2026-15415-001** (MEDIUM) — `awslabs.aws-healthomics-mcp-server` >= 0.0.36: `workflow_files` path traversal.

CVE-2026-62208 (OpenClaw) added to the existing `AAK-MCP-OPENCLAW-CVE-2026-62195-001`
pin (already covers the affected range). Dispositioned: Frogman ×4 (PHP),
Claude Code Action (GitHub Action), AI Copilot (WordPress), ForgeCode (no fix
version), Langflow ×2 (no NVD data). Rule count 254 → **261**.

### Added — 2026-07-13..15 MCP/agent CVE disclosure-wave pins (7 rules, closes 13 cve-response issues)

CVE-response for the 2026-07-13..15 disclosure wave (issues #429–#442). Eight
CVEs have a vendor fix + a pinnable PyPI/npm artifact and ship as version-pins in
`mcp_cve_pins_2026_07` (now 15 pins total); five are dispositioned in
`CHANGELOG.cves.md`. Package names, fix floors, and NVD CPE ranges (where
published) were verified before shipping.

- **AAK-MCP-HEALTHLAKE-CVE-2026-15643-001** (HIGH) — `awslabs.healthlake-mcp-server` >= 0.0.14: `next_token` pagination SSRF → AWS credential exfil.
- **AAK-MCP-PRAISONAI-CVE-2026-61427-001** (HIGH) — `praisonai` >= 4.6.78: MCP HTTP-stream unauthenticated by default.
- **AAK-MCP-APPIUM-CVE-2026-58500-001** (HIGH) — `appium-mcp` >= 1.85.10: locator-UI HTML/JS injection → `postMessage` tool exec.
- **AAK-MCP-PENPOT-CVE-2026-45805-001** (CRITICAL) — `@penpot/mcp` >= 2.15.0: ReplServer unauthenticated `/execute` → JS RCE.
- **AAK-MCP-OPENCLAW-CVE-2026-62195-001** (HIGH) — `openclaw` >= 2026.6.6 (NVD range 2026.5.20–<2026.6.6): MCP loopback authorization bypass.
- **AAK-MCP-REPOMIX-CVE-2026-49988-001** (MEDIUM) — `repomix` >= 1.14.1: MCP file-read bypasses the secret-lint boundary.
- **AAK-MCP-BETTERAUTH-CVE-2026-53512-001** (HIGH) — `better-auth` / `@better-auth/oauth-provider` >= 1.6.11: refresh-token grant skips `client_secret` (CVE-2026-53512) + auth-code replay (CVE-2026-53518).

Dispositioned (no pinnable artifact / vendor fix / supported ecosystem, documented
in `CHANGELOG.cves.md`): CVE-2026-61462 (mcp-gitlab — no NVD version data yet),
CVE-2026-15749/15750/15751 (mastergo-magic-mcp — GitHub-only, no vendor fix;
15750 class-covered by `AAK-MCP-SSRF-001`), CVE-2026-15583 (Grafana MCP — Go
ecosystem). Rule count 247 → **254**.

### Added — AAK-OAUTH-007 (RFC 8707 Resource Indicators) + ratified-spec reconciliation

- **AAK-OAUTH-007** (MEDIUM, MCP_CONFIG) — flags an OAuth 2.1 flow, or an MCP
  client/server config advertising OAuth 2.1, that never sets the RFC 8707
  `resource` parameter. Without Resource Indicators the issued token is not
  audience-bound, so a token minted for one MCP server can be replayed at
  another (confused-deputy / audience confusion). Cited to the **ratified** MCP
  2025-11-25 authorization spec (RFC 8707 §2 / RFC 9728 §7.4) — a requirement
  today, not a 2026-07-28 change. Deterministic regex detection in
  `oauth_misconfig` (fires when a token-acquisition flow lacks `resource`;
  silent when it is present, including RFC 9728 protected-resource-metadata).
  Rule count 246 → **247**.
- **MCP 2026-07-28 ratification reconciliation.** Re-verified every July rule's
  cited SEP against primary sources (modelcontextprotocol PRs #2596/#2791, the
  RC blog, the `2026-07-28-RC` milestone): `AAK-MCP-DEPRECATED-001..003`
  (SEP-2577 + SEP-2596), `AAK-OAUTH-006` (SEP-2468), `AAK-MCP-STATELESS-001..004`
  (SEP-2567/2575/1442/1686/2663) — all accurate, no corrections. The 2026-07-28
  spec is still a **release candidate** (ratifies 2026-07-28), so the rules keep
  their "release candidate" labelling rather than being relabelled "ratified"
  prematurely. Attestation recorded in `CHANGELOG.cves.md`. Also softened the
  ledger's leftover 48h-SLA header to best-effort (completing the retirement
  started in the docs pass).

### Changed — docs: single-source rule count + retire unbounded 48h CVE-SLA claim

- **Single source of truth for the rule count.** `scripts/sync_rule_count.py`
  now also drives `docs/rules.md` (the per-category Summary table is
  regenerated wholesale from the live registry between `<!-- BEGIN/END
  rules-summary -->` markers) and the rule-count cells in `docs/comparison.md`
  and `docs/comparison-gitlab-agentic-sast.md` (via `<!-- rule-count:total -->`
  anchors). These docs had drifted to a stale **221** (and silently dropped the
  12th category, `MCP_SERVER_CARD`) while the registry was at 246. New
  regression tests in `tests/test_rule_count_sync.py` fail CI if any of these
  surfaces diverge from `len(RULES)`.
- **Retired the unbounded 48-hour CVE→rule SLA.** The public commitment is now
  a best-effort statement ("triaged continuously, shipped as fast as we
  responsibly can, no fixed deadline"), matching `ROADMAP_2026.md §2.3`. Updated
  the `cve-watcher` workflow name/header/checklist and the launch/application
  copy. The NVD watcher, the `cve-response` issue flow, the `CHANGELOG.cves.md`
  ledger, and the release gate (which keys off the retained `sla-48h` label) are
  unchanged. Separate, bounded 48h commitments — the SECURITY.md report
  acknowledgment and the coordinated-disclosure repo-notify window — are kept.

### Added — 2026-07 MCP/agent CVE disclosure-wave pins (8 rules, closes 13 sla-48h issues)

CVE-response for the 2026-07-08..12 disclosure backlog. New table-driven scanner
(`mcp_cve_pins_2026_07`) + **8 dependency version-pin rules**, package names and
fix floors verified against PyPI / npm before shipping:

- **AAK-MCP-LITELLM-CVE-2026-59822-001** (HIGH) — `litellm` < 1.84.0: MCP auth bypass via empty `UserAPIKeyAuth()` fallback (CVE-2026-59822) + skills-archive path traversal (CVE-2026-59820).
- **AAK-MCP-CLINE-CVE-2026-59723-001** (HIGH) — `cline` < 3.0.30: Hub-dashboard WebSocket origin bypass → RCE (CVE-2026-59723).
- **AAK-MCP-TEXTEDITOR-CVE-2026-15138-001** (MEDIUM) — `mcp-text-editor` ≤ 1.0.2: `file_path` path traversal (CVE-2026-15138).
- **AAK-MCP-N8N-CVE-2026-59207-001** (MEDIUM) — `n8n` < 2.27.4 / 2.28.1: MCP tool bypasses credential domain allow-list → secret exfil (CVE-2026-59207).
- **AAK-MCP-RUFLO-CVE-2026-59726-001** (CRITICAL) — `ruflo` < 3.16.3: unauthenticated MCP bridge → `tools/call` RCE (CVE-2026-59726, CVSS 10).
- **AAK-MCP-DEEPSEEK-CVE-2026-55604-001** (HIGH) — `@arikusi/deepseek-mcp-server` < 1.8.0: unbound `session_id` + unauth HTTP transport (CVE-2026-55604, CVE-2026-55605).
- **AAK-MCP-K8S-CVE-2026-61459-001** (CRITICAL) — `mcp-server-kubernetes` < 3.9.0: `kubectl --server` argument injection → cluster compromise (CVE-2026-61459, CVSS 9.8).
- **AAK-MCP-ASTRBOT-CVE-2026-15501-001** (MEDIUM) — `astrbot` ≤ 4.25.2: MCP-test-endpoint SSRF (CVE-2026-15501).

Three sibling CVEs are dispositioned in `CHANGELOG.cves.md` rather than as pins
(no pinnable PyPI/npm artifact or tractable version scheme): CVE-2026-15189
(aerostack-mcp SSRF, rolling — covered by the `AAK-MCP-SSRF-001` class),
CVE-2026-54149 (MaxKB stdio command-injection — covered by the
`AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-*` class), and CVE-2026-55405 (langchain4j Maven — four
parallel beta fix-lines, Maven pin ecosystem not yet supported).

Fixture-backed tests; `rules.json` regenerated. Rule count **238 → 246**,
scanners **83 → 84**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-DEPRECATED-* + AAK-OAUTH-006: MCP 2026-07-28 final-spec deprecation pack

New scanner (`mcp_deprecated_features`) and rule family for the MCP
[2026-07-28 release candidate](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/).
The RC ships MCP's first formal deprecation policy (**SEP-2596**, a minimum
12-month deprecation→removal window) and, under it, annotation-deprecates three
core capabilities via **SEP-2577**:

- **AAK-MCP-DEPRECATED-001** (MEDIUM) — `roots` capability (`roots/list`); migrate to tool parameters / config.
- **AAK-MCP-DEPRECATED-002** (MEDIUM) — `sampling` capability (`sampling/createMessage`); call the LLM provider API directly. Distinct from `AAK-MCP-SAMPLING-001` (a *consent* guard on sampling) — this flags the deprecated capability itself.
- **AAK-MCP-DEPRECATED-003** (MEDIUM) — `logging` capability (`logging/setLevel`); emit to stderr / OpenTelemetry.

The scanner flags each deprecated surface across MCP config files, manifests, and
server/client source; detection is tight (MCP method strings + SDK type names +
a JSON `capabilities` walk) so ordinary stdlib `logging` / `logger.setLevel`
does not fire.

Also adds **AAK-OAUTH-006** (MEDIUM, in `oauth_misconfig`) for the RC's *actual*
new OAuth requirement — **RFC 9207 `iss` validation (SEP-2468)**: an
authorization-code client that handles the auth response but never validates the
`iss` parameter. (The RC does **not** reference RFC 9728 / RFC 8707; those belong
to MCP's existing authorization spec, not this changelog — so no rule cites them
against 2026-07-28.)

Fixture-backed tests; `rules.json` regenerated. Rule count **234 → 238**,
scanners **82 → 83**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-SERENA-CVE-2026-49471-001: pin CVE-2026-49471 (Serena MCP unauthenticated-dashboard RCE)

CVE-response (closes #411). New **HIGH** rule + version-pin detector for
[CVE-2026-49471](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-49471) (CVSS 8.3,
CWE-306 + CWE-352): the Serena MCP coding toolkit (`serena-agent`) before 1.5.2
ships an unauthenticated Flask dashboard on a fixed port (no auth, no CSRF, no
Host-header validation); a DNS-rebinding attack writes arbitrary content into
the agent's persistent memory store, which — combined with
`execute_shell_command(shell=True)` — is a remote-code-execution chain. Fires on
`serena-agent < 1.5.2` / unpinned, and on an unpinned `oraios/serena` /
`serena-mcp-server` launch reference, across manifests + MCP config files.
Fixture-backed test; `rules.json` regenerated. Rule count **233 → 234**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-SSRF-001: pin CVE-2026-14748 (MCP-server SSRF via unvalidated tool-arg URL, CWE-918)

New **MEDIUM** rule + scanner (`mcp_ssrf_toolarg`) for
[CVE-2026-14748](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-14748) (CVSS 6.3
MEDIUM, CWE-918): an MCP tool handler that passes an attacker-controllable `url` /
`endpoint` / `target` argument straight into an outbound `requests` / `httpx` /
`urllib` / `aiohttp` fetch with no host/scheme allow-list — AIAnytime
Awesome-MCP-Server's `mcp-wiki/wiki-summary` is the anchor. Detection uses a
stdlib `ast` parameter→fetch taint path for Python (the same mechanism as
`mcp_auth_pathtraversal`; no new engine) with a comment-stripped regex fallback
for TS/JS/Rust. Complements the generic `AAK-SSRF-001..005` text family, which
keys on request-object accessors and misses the bare-parameter CVE shape.
Committed fixture pair (`tests/fixtures/mcp_ssrf/` — vulnerable + host-allow-listed
safe handler); cross-referenced to OWASP MCP09:2025 + Agentic ASI06;
`rules.json` regenerated. Rule count **232 → 233**, scanners **81 → 82**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-GATEWAY-REGISTRY-CVE-2026-14471-001 (Amazon mcp-gateway-registry SQLi)

CVE-response (closes #408). New **HIGH** rule + version-pin detector for
[CVE-2026-14471](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-14471) (CVSS 8.1):
Amazon `mcp-gateway-registry` before 1.0.13 interpolates a caller-supplied
`table_name` into an SQL identifier position in the metrics-service retention
policy (CWE-89), letting an authenticated remote user run arbitrary SQL. Fires
on `< 1.0.13` or an unpinned reference across manifests + MCP config files;
fixture-backed test; `rules.json` regenerated. Rule count **231 → 232**.

### Fixed — correct SEP citations on the AAK-MCP-STATELESS-* pack

Citation-accuracy pass on the shipped stateless-migration rules (no detection
change, rule count stays 231). The `Mcp-Session-Id` / protocol-session removal
was mis-attributed to SEP-1442; it is actually **SEP-2567** ("Sessionless MCP
via Explicit State Handles"), with SEP-1442 / **SEP-2575** making the init
handshake optional so stateless is the default. The `tasks/list` removal cited
a **non-existent SEP-1359**; corrected to the experimental Tasks primitive
(**SEP-1686**) moving out of core into the Extensions framework (redesigned as
**SEP-2663**). Updated `AAK-MCP-STATELESS-001`/`-002` descriptions, the
`mcp_stateless_migration` scanner docstring + engine label, and `rules.json`.
Verified against modelcontextprotocol.io + the MCP GitHub SEPs. Version
**0.3.46 → 0.3.47**.

### Security — Flowise CVE-2026-58057 (closes #372)

Bumped `AAK-FLOWISE-001`'s pin floor **3.1.2 → 3.1.3** and added
[CVE-2026-58057](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-58057) (Flowise
before 3.1.3 validates Custom-MCP stdio env vars against a *case-sensitive*
denylist, so on Windows `node_options` bypasses the `NODE_OPTIONS` entry and
reaches `NODE_OPTIONS --require` RCE). Flowise 3.1.2 configs now flag; test +
ledger updated. Clears the last open `sla-48h` gate item.

### Added — bench: determinism head-to-head

New `benchmarks/determinism/` proves AAK yields a **byte-identical finding set
across 20 runs** (single shared SHA-256, 0% variance) over a fixed committed
corpus, using the real `engine.run_scan` entrypoint — contrasted, **cited (from
their own docs), not re-run**, against LLM-judge tools (Snyk Agent Scan +
[Cisco DefenseClaw](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/defenseclaw)). No
competitor number is fabricated; the LLM-as-judge variance concern is cited to
[arXiv:2606.13685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.13685) ("The Coin Flip Judge?").
`tests/test_determinism_benchmark.py` enforces the single-digest invariant in
CI; README's determinism bullet + comparison table link
`benchmarks/determinism/RESULTS.md`. Version **0.3.45 → 0.3.46**.

### Added — Public OWASP coverage leaderboard (issue #67) + Kong Konnect MCP CVE

**OWASP coverage leaderboard (#67).** New generator `scripts/gen_coverage.py`
emits two Markdown tables from the **live rule registry** so they cannot drift:
`docs/coverage/owasp-agentic-top10.md` (ASI01–ASI10) and
`docs/coverage/owasp-mcp-top10.md` (MCP01:2025–MCP10:2025). Each OWASP slot maps
to the exact AAK rule IDs that cover it, with a **published, reproducible**
coverage label (Full = ≥3 rules, Partial = 1–2, None = 0) — not a self-scored
grade. Includes an honest "coverage vs. named toolkits" note: the Microsoft
Agent Governance Toolkit (2026-04-02, MIT) states 10/10 Agentic coverage as a
*runtime* enforcer; AAK reports its per-category *static* rule counts next to it
(a cross-reference, not a head-to-head benchmark). CI fails on staleness via
`tests/test_coverage_tables.py` (runs `gen_coverage.check()` in every test job).
README links the leaderboard from the Frameworks section and the State-of-MCP
report. Fully offline/deterministic — no account, cloud call, or signup.

**AAK-MCP-KONG-CVE-2026-13341-001** (HIGH). Kong Konnect MCP server before 1.0.0
is vulnerable to **indirect prompt injection** — untrusted content the server
relays can carry instructions the agent acts on, issuing unintended
Konnect/Admin API requests ([CVE-2026-13341](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-13341),
CVSS 7.4, published 2026-07-03; fixed in 1.0.0). Detected as a version pin in
`supply_chain.py` across dependency manifests **and** MCP config files (fires on
`< 1.0.0` or an unpinned reference). Category TOOL_POISONING, OWASP MCP05:2025 +
ASI01.

Rule count **230 → 231**. Version **0.3.44 → 0.3.45**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-CARD-* : MCP Server Card (SEP-1649) static audit + discovery crawler

New **MCP Server Card** rule category (`Category.MCP_SERVER_CARD`) + scanner
(`scanners/mcp_server_card.py`) that statically audits SEP-1649 discovery cards
(`/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`) — a client fetches and trusts a card
*before* connecting, so the card is an attack surface. Four deterministic rules:

- **AAK-MCP-CARD-001** (CRITICAL) — tool-description poisoning / imperative
  injection in `tools[].description`. **Reuses** the AAK-POISON-001..006
  detectors (invisible Unicode, prompt-injection, cross-tool reference, encoded
  payloads) — nothing duplicated.
- **AAK-MCP-CARD-002** (HIGH) — declared-transport vs advertised-capability
  mismatch (remote transport with `authentication.required: false`, or a
  `stdio`/local card advertising a remote `endpoint`).
- **AAK-MCP-CARD-003** (HIGH) — missing / placeholder signature / provenance;
  the card's self-declared tools + endpoint are trusted with no origin proof.
- **AAK-MCP-CARD-004** (MEDIUM) — over-broad capability claims (wildcard scopes,
  all-capabilities, `required: true` with empty `schemes`).

SARIF 2.1.0 emitter (fingerprint + `fixes[]` + security-severity) is reused
unchanged. Emits are stdlib-only and **offline by default** — card fetching is
opt-in (`AAK_FETCH_SERVER_CARD_URL`, or the crawler's `--server-cards` pass).

**Discovery crawler:** `benchmarks/sources.py` gains `well_known_server_cards()`
and `benchmarks/crawler.py` a `--server-cards` network pass that enumerates
servers, probes `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`, audits each card, and writes
a **dated** `benchmarks/results-<date>.json` (never overwrites
`results-2026-06-13.json`). New test + poisoned/clean card fixtures under
`tests/fixtures/server_cards/`.

Rule count **226 → 230**; scanner modules **80 → 81**; categories **11 → 12**.
Version **0.3.43 → 0.3.44**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-AUTH-PATHTRAVERSAL-001: bearer-token → session-file path traversal ([CVE-2026-52830](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-52830))

CVE-response cycle item (closes #394). New **CRITICAL** rule + scanner
(`scanners/mcp_auth_pathtraversal.py`) flagging MCP auth code that concatenates
or `os.path.join`-es an untrusted token / bearer credential into a session file
path used for an existence/read check — without rejecting path separators / `..`
or resolving-and-containing the result. The caller controls the token, so they
control the path (`../../etc/passwd`, `../<other-session>`): an auth check becomes
arbitrary-file access + cross-session takeover. Anchor: **CVE-2026-52830**
(CVSS 9.4, CWE-22) — `fast-mcp-telegram` before 0.19.1 joined the caller-supplied
bearer token straight into the session path; fixed in 0.19.1.

Python detection reuses the repo's stdlib-`ast` taint mechanism (token source →
path construction → `exists`/`open` sink, suppressed by a separator/`..` reject
or a resolve-and-contain guard — no new taint engine; the #22 tree-sitter
migration is separate); TS/JS/Rust use the analogous concat-into-path regex.
Category **MCP_CONFIG** (matching the nearest auth rules), OWASP **MCP07:2025**,
**ASI03**. Distinct from `AAK-MCP-015` (resource-handler path traversal on a
request *path* param). FP guards: separator-rejected + resolved-and-contained
flows, constant paths, and non-auth code all pass; SARIF carries the fingerprint,
the remediation, and the critical-band security-severity.

Rule count **225 → 226**; scanner modules **79 → 80**. Version **0.3.42 → 0.3.43**.

### Added — MCP prevalence scan (664 configs) + score calibration (issue #23)

Empirical sequel to the State-of-MCP-Security harness. Widened the corpus by
sweeping five MCP-config filename queries in `benchmarks/crawler.py` (was a
single `.mcp.json` query capped at GitHub Code Search's 1,000-result ceiling ≈
571 distinct) → **664 distinct public configs**. Re-ran the #373 harness (reuses
`engine.run_scan` + `scoring.compute_score`; extended to emit `owasp_mcp_hit_rate`
and top-10). New report `research/state-of-mcp-2026/PREVALENCE.md`: the score
distribution (A 30% / B 36% / C 13% / D 7% / F 13%; **median grade B, top 10%
A** — the empirical anchor #23 asked for), 26.1% critical, 24.2% no-auth,
OWASP-MCP hit rate (MCP07 99.4%), top-10 findings, methodology, honest
limitations, and manual distribution drafts. `REPORT.md` now redirects to
PREVALENCE.md (canonical); README + `docs/DISTRIBUTION-CHECKLIST.md` updated to
664. Aggregate-only, no per-server list published and no CVEs filed (90-day
coordinated-disclosure policy). No package code touched — version stays 0.3.42.

### Changed — finish the State of MCP Security 2026 report (launch-ready)

Promoted the data-report harness (shipped in #373) into a finished, launch-ready
report. `research/state-of-mcp-2026/REPORT.md` gains an executive summary, an
OWASP-MCP-Top-10 hit-rate table, three anonymized CVE-class case studies, a
"how we scan (offline, reproducible)" section leading with the two wedges, and a
`pip install` self-scan block so the report doubles as a distribution funnel.
Every figure is sourced to `results.json` — the harness was re-run against the
current corpus (571 distinct configs; 25.7% critical; 28.9% grade A; 99.3% trip
OWASP MCP07). The harness now also aggregates `owasp_mcp_hit_rate` (no scanner
change — it reads `owasp_mcp_references` off the existing rules). Filled
`docs/DISTRIBUTION-CHECKLIST.md` with ready-to-post copy (Show HN, r/netsec,
OWASP working-group note, awesome-mcp-security) — operator-posted, nothing
auto-posts. Version **0.3.41 → 0.3.42**. No scanner rules added; rule count
stays 225.

### Changed — docs: align public rule-count to canonical 225; promote State-of-MCP-Security-2026 report

Killed the last public rule-count drift: the GitHub repo "About" description and
every human-facing rule-count string (`CLAUDE.md`, launch outreach/blog/awesome
drafts, the launch data-report draft) said **221** — corrected to the canonical
**225** (matching the README badge, the `RULES` registry, `rules.json`, and the
`test_rule_count_is_canonical` CI fence). Adjacent stale metrics on the same
lines were fixed too (75 → 79 scanners, v0.3.34 → v0.3.41). Promoted the
reproducible report: the README "State of MCP Security 2026" section now leads
with the two wedges (offline/deterministic + compliance-evidence), the earlier
`launch/state-of-mcp-security-2026.md` marketing draft is banner-marked as
superseded by `research/state-of-mcp-2026/REPORT.md` (canonical), and a manual
`docs/DISTRIBUTION-CHECKLIST.md` lists launch surfaces (Show HN, r/netsec,
awesome-mcp-security, OWASP working group). Docs/metadata only — no version bump.

### Added — State-of-MCP-Security-2026 research harness + report

New `research/state-of-mcp-2026/` directory: a reproducible data-report harness
(`run_report.py`) that scans a corpus of public MCP configs and aggregates a
grade distribution (A–F), per-category hit rates, and the top misconfigurations.
It contains **no scanner** — it reuses `agent_audit_kit.engine.run_scan` and
`agent_audit_kit.scoring.compute_score` (the same scan + grade the CLI / MCP
Security Index use), and delegates corpus acquisition to the existing
`benchmarks/crawler.py`. Ships the raw aggregate (`results.json`) and the
human-readable writeup (`REPORT.md`). Headline from the committed run: 571
distinct configs, 25.7% with a critical finding, ~29% grade A. README gains a
"State of MCP Security 2026" section with the reproduce command. Docs/research
only — no package code, no version bump.

### Changed — CVE-backlog coverage: extend existing pins (Flowise/LiteLLM/Doris)

Worked the open `sla-48h` backlog. The genuinely AAK-actionable items map to
packages AAK already pins, so the existing rules were extended rather than
duplicated:

- **Flowise** (`AAK-FLOWISE-001`): pin floor bumped **3.1.0 → 3.1.2** so
  3.0.6–3.1.1 are still flagged; added CVE-2025-71336 (< 3.0.6 unsandboxed RCE)
  and CVE-2026-56274 (< 3.1.2 OS command injection / regex bypass) to the
  Custom-MCP RCE cluster.
- **LiteLLM** (`AAK-LITELLM-CVE-2026-30623-PIN-001`): added CVE-2026-12773
  (MCP-proxy improper auth), CVE-2026-12774 + CVE-2026-12798 (MCP SSRF) — all
  already flagged by the existing `< 1.83.7` floor.
- **Apache Doris** (`AAK-DORIS-001`): added sibling CVE-2025-66336 (metadata-path
  SQL injection), covered by the existing `< 0.6.1` floor.

The remaining backlog issues were vulnerabilities **inside third-party products
AAK does not scan** (desktop apps, web platforms, plugins, the Linux kernel) or
patterns **already detected** by generalised rules (no-auth HTTP transport,
DNS-rebind, hook auto-exec, SSRF, tool-gate authz) — dispositioned and closed
with per-issue reasons, no fabricated rules. Rule count unchanged (225).

### Changed — retire public 48h CVE-to-rule SLA (unbounded solo liability); lead with offline + compliance-evidence wedges

Removed the public "48h CVE-to-rule SLA" promise — a clock a solo maintainer
can't reliably carry — from the README badge/bullet, ROADMAP_2026.md, and the
live launch copy (`docs/launch/{hn,reddit,x-thread}.md`). Replaced it with a
capability statement (no deadline): newly disclosed MCP CVEs are triaged and
turned into rules as they land, surfaced by the NVD watcher
(`.github/workflows/cve-watcher.yml`) and logged in `CHANGELOG.cves.md`. The
README now leads with the two defensible wedges — **fully offline / deterministic
scanning** and **auditor-ready compliance-evidence packs** — instead of response
speed. No detection logic, no version bump. The NVD watcher and the `sla-48h`
automation label (a release-gate dependency) are unchanged.

### Fixed — single canonical rule count enforced in CI (was drifting 77/148/169/194 across surfaces)

The rule count is computed from `len(RULES)` (the registry in
`agent_audit_kit/rules/builtin.py`) and asserted equal across every
current-state surface by `tests/test_rule_count_sync.py::test_rule_count_is_canonical`:
README badge + total-anchors, `action.yml` description, `__init__.RULE_COUNT`,
the signed `rules.json` bundle, the pyproject `description`, and the
present-tense launch copy (`docs/launch/{hn,reddit,x-thread}.md`). Fixed the
last drifting surface — launch copy still said "221 rules" — to the canonical
**225**. Historical/version-stamped/per-category counts (CHANGELOG, ROADMAP
Apr-2026 starting point, `(v0.3.5)` snapshots, per-OWASP-category tables) are
intentionally out of scope and left unchanged. Version **0.3.40 → 0.3.41**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-NOAUTH-DEFAULT: MCP server unauthenticated-by-default / fail-open auth ([CVE-2026-48814](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-48814))

CVE-response cycle item. New **HIGH** rule + scanner
(`scanners/mcp_noauth_default.py`) for MCP servers that ship an auth check that
**does not actually enforce** — distinct from `AAK-MCP-HTTP-NOAUTH-SERVER-001`
(no auth configured at all). Three arms:

- **(a) fail-open auth** — an `is_authorized` / `verify_token`-style function
  that returns truthy when the secret/token is empty or unset
  (`if not SECRET: return True`);
- **(b) default/placeholder secret** — a secret-named var set to `""` /
  `"changeme"` / `"secret"` / `"admin"` etc., or `os.environ.get("X_SECRET", "")`
  with an empty default;
- **(c) warning-only gate** — a missing-secret check that only logs and
  continues while the server binds a non-loopback interface (`0.0.0.0` / `::`).

Anchor: **CVE-2026-48814** (Network-AI, CVSS 9.1) — an *incomplete fix* of
CVE-2026-46701 whose added auth gate still admitted requests when the secret was
unset. **CWE-306** (Missing Authentication) + **CWE-862** (Missing
Authorization); **MCP07:2025**, **ASI03**. Python uses stdlib `ast`; JSON / YAML
/ env / TOML configs use a guarded text pass (placeholder secret + non-loopback
bind). FP guards: a required secret (no empty default), a non-empty literal, an
auth fn returning `token == SECRET`, and a loopback bind all pass.

Rule count **224 → 225**; scanner modules **78 → 79**. Version **0.3.39 → 0.3.40**.

### Changed — AAK-MCP-HTTP-NOAUTH-SERVER-001 now anchors mcp-pinot + Windows-MCP ([CVE-2026-49257](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-49257), [CVE-2026-48989](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-48989))

CVE-response cycle item. **Extended the existing unauthenticated-HTTP-transport
rule** (not a new duplicate — anti-duplicate check below) with two named 2026
instances of the exact 0.0.0.0 / no-auth / wildcard-CORS class it already
detects:

- **CVE-2026-49257** — mcp-pinot ≤ 3.0.1 (CVSS 10.0, CWE-306) defaults to an
  HTTP MCP server bound to `0.0.0.0:8080` with no authentication, exposing SQL
  execution as a confused deputy.
- **CVE-2026-48989** — Windows-MCP < 0.7.5 (CVSS 8.9, CWE-306) exposed the MCP
  control plane over HTTP with no auth while enabling wildcard CORS.

Both CVEs added to the rule's `cve_references` + description exemplars; new
fixtures pin the mcp-pinot (`0.0.0.0:8080` no-auth) and Windows-MCP (wildcard
CORS) shapes, plus a SARIF-fingerprint-stability test. No detection-engine
changes were needed — the existing source + config arms already fire on both.

**Anti-duplicate check:** `rg -i "wildcard CORS|0.0.0.0|no.?auth|unauthenticated"`
over `agent_audit_kit/rules/builtin.py` matched the pre-existing
`AAK-MCP-HTTP-NOAUTH-SERVER-001` (HTTP/SSE/Streamable-HTTP bound `0.0.0.0`/`::`
or wildcard CORS, no auth — CWE-306). Per the repo's extend-don't-duplicate
discipline the two CVEs were **added to that rule**, not filed as a separate
`AAK-MCP-*` rule (a near-identical rule would double-fire). Rule count unchanged
(**224**).

Version **0.3.38 → 0.3.39**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-ARGV-TOCTOU-001: argv rebuilt after allowlist approval before spawn ([CVE-2026-53822](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-53822))

CVE-response cycle item. New **HIGH** rule + scanner (`scanners/argv_toctou.py`)
flagging the check-then-mutate-then-exec data flow where a command / argv buffer
is **approved against an allow/deny list and then reassigned, re-split
(`shlex.split` / `.split()`), re-joined, concatenated, or `.extend()`/`.push()`-ed
before it is spawned**, with no re-validation between the mutation and the spawn —
so a different (unapproved) command shape executes.

Anchor: **CVE-2026-53822** (CVSS 8.8) — "OpenClaw before 2026.5.18 contains a
command injection vulnerability where shell wrapper argv could change between
approval and execution." **CWE-77** (Command Injection) chained to **CWE-367**
(TOCTOU Race Condition). Because the OpenClaw instance is Node.js, both Python
(`subprocess` / `os.exec*`, stdlib `ast`) and TS/JS (`child_process.spawn` /
`exec` / `execFile`, `execa`; comment-stripped line-ordered regex) are analysed.
Maps **MCP05:2025**, **ASI02**. Distinct from `AAK-SSRF-TOCTOU-001` (a URL
allow-list DNS-rebind TOCTOU, not command spawn).

FP guards: approve → spawn with no mutation in between PASSES; a re-check after
the mutation (approve → mutate → approve → spawn) PASSES. SARIF carries the rule
ID, a partial fingerprint, a `fixes[]` entry, and a `security-severity` score.

Rule count **223 → 224**; scanner modules **77 → 78**. Version **0.3.37 → 0.3.38**.

### Added — AAK-SKILL-UNTRUSTED-EXEC-PATH: untrusted-search-path executable override in skill/install flows ([CVE-2026-53819](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-53819))

CVE-response cycle item. New **HIGH** rule + scanner
(`scanners/skill_untrusted_exec_path.py`) flagging install / skill-setup code
that resolves an executable, interpreter, or build tool from a
**workspace-controlled source** and runs it without an absolute-path pin or
allowlist. Detected sources:

- a `.env` / dotenv-sourced variable (`load_dotenv()` then `os.environ.get(...)`
  / `os.getenv(...)` / `dotenv_values(...)`);
- a `PATH` prepended with a non-absolute / workspace dir
  (`os.environ["PATH"] = os.getcwd() + os.pathsep + ...`);
- `shutil.which(...)` resolved over such a tainted `PATH`;
- a Homebrew / package-manager binary chosen via an env override.

Anchor: **CVE-2026-53819** (CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path, CVSS 8.7) — OpenClaw
before 2026.5.27 let a workspace `.env` override the Homebrew executable
selection during skill install, executing unintended Homebrew-compatible
binaries to compromise the system. Python is analysed with stdlib `ast`; shell
install scripts use a guarded regex. Maps **CWE-426**, **MCP05:2025**, **ASI06**.
Distinct from `AAK-CLAUDE-WIN-001` (Windows ProgramData config-path hijack) and
the `AAK-SKILL-001..005` SKILL.md content checks. FP guards: absolute-path-pinned
binary, `os.path.isabs` / allowlist check, and non-install files all pass. SARIF
output carries the rule ID, CWE-426 (fullDescription), the fix hint (help text),
and the CVE tag.

Rule count **222 → 223**; scanner modules **76 → 77**. Version **0.3.36 → 0.3.37**.

### Changed — AAK-MCP-HTTP-NOAUTH-SERVER-001 extended to the launch surface ([CVE-2026-23744](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23744))

CVE-response cycle item. **Extended the existing no-auth-transport rule** (not a
new duplicate — anti-duplicate check below) to flag the *launch* surface, where
an MCP server / the MCP Inspector binds a non-loopback interface with no auth:

- **MCP config files** — `mcp.json`, `claude_desktop_config.json`, `*.mcp.yaml`
  `command`/`args` declaring `--host 0.0.0.0` / `::` / a routable IP.
- **Docker** — `--host 0.0.0.0` and `-p 0.0.0.0:` publishes in
  `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose*.yml`.
- **MCP Inspector / FastMCP startup args** — `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
  --host 0.0.0.0` with no `MCP_PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN` / `--token` / `requireAuth`, or
  with the `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH` kill-switch set (overrides any token marker).

`CVE-2026-23744` (MCP Inspector, CVSS 9.8) is the motivating exemplar of the
launch-bind variant; Censys counted ~12,520 MCP services exposed on the public
internet in this shape. The rule already covered server *source* binding
`0.0.0.0` / wildcard CORS (GitLab/Nocturne/AgenticMail). Maps **CWE-306**,
**MCP07:2025**, **ASI03**. FP guards: 127.0.0.1 + token, `--require-auth`, and
non-MCP Docker/compose files with `0.0.0.0` all pass.

**Anti-duplicate check (G9):** `rg -i "0.0.0.0|bind|CWE-306|unauthenticated"`
over `agent_audit_kit/rules/` matched the pre-existing
`AAK-MCP-HTTP-NOAUTH-SERVER-001` (0.0.0.0 + no-auth, source-only). Per G9 the new
config/Docker/inspector patterns were **added to that rule + scanner**, not filed
as a separate `mcp_exposed_no_auth` rule. Rule count unchanged (**222**).

Version **0.3.35 → 0.3.36**.

### Added — AAK-LLM-SQL-RCE-001: LLM-generated SQL on an RCE-capable DB role ([CVE-2026-25879](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25879))

CVE-response cycle item. New **CRITICAL** rule + scanner
(`scanners/llm_sql_rce.py`) for the text-to-SQL agent RCE class: an agent feeds
**model-generated SQL** into a database executor whose connection role holds
code-execution / filesystem privileges, so a prompt-injected
`COPY ... FROM PROGRAM` (PostgreSQL), `INTO OUTFILE` / `LOAD_FILE` (MySQL `FILE`
privilege), or `xp_cmdshell` (MS SQL) escalates SQL injection to shell.

Two detection arms (both emit the rule):

- **Flow** — an LLM-output value reaches a SQL-execution sink
  (`cursor.execute` / `conn.execute` / SQLAlchemy `text(...)`; TS `.query()` /
  `.raw()`) **as the query itself**, with no allow-list / `sqlglot`-style
  validation. Python uses a stdlib `ast` taint fixpoint (propagates through
  `response.choices[0].message.content`); TS/JS uses guarded regex.
- **Privilege** — a connection string / role granting the dangerous primitives
  (superuser account, or literal `COPY ... FROM PROGRAM` /
  `pg_execute_server_program` / `xp_cmdshell` / `GRANT ... FILE`) inside an
  LLM/agent context.

CVE-2026-25879 documents a "chat with your database" agent that ran model
output on a superuser connection. Maps **CWE-94 → CWE-89 → CWE-78** via
**CWE-250** (excess privilege); **MCP04:2025**, **ASI02** + **ASI05**.
Distinct from `AAK-TAINT-005` (tool *parameter* → SQL string-format). FP guards:
parameterised queries, validated/allow-listed flows, least-privilege read-only
roles, and non-agent DB-admin scripts all pass.

Rule count **221 → 222**; scanner modules **75 → 76**. Version
**0.3.34 → 0.3.35**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-HTTP-NOAUTH-SERVER-001: unauthenticated MCP HTTP/SSE server (2026 no-auth-transport class)

CVE-response backlog item. New **HIGH** rule + scanner
(`scanners/mcp_http_noauth_server.py`) flagging a repo that publishes an MCP
server over HTTP/SSE/Streamable-HTTP with **no inbound auth** while binding to
`0.0.0.0`/`::` or serving wildcard CORS — a mutation-capable, token-backed RPC
endpoint reachable without credentials.

Generalises the Azure-only `AAK-AZURE-MCP-NOAUTH-001` to any published MCP HTTP
server (defers on Azure-MCP repos to avoid double-firing). Also detects the
auth-bypass-when-token-unset variant. Covers a recurring 2026 shape: **GitLab
MCP Server (CVE-2026-44895)**, **Nocturne Memory (CVE-2026-44830)**,
**AgenticMail (CVE-2026-50287)**. Maps to **MCP07:2025** (Insufficient Auth),
**ASI03**. FP guards: authenticated handler, `127.0.0.1` bind, stdio server,
and Azure repos all pass.

### CVE-response backlog triage (23 issues closed)

Worked the full open `sla-48h` backlog. One genuine generalizable gap became a
rule (above, closing the GitLab/Nocturne/AgenticMail no-auth cluster); the rest
were dispositioned by verified triage — **no fabricated rules**:

- **Already covered by an existing rule/class** (closed with references):
  path traversal in MCP resource handlers → `AAK-MCP-015` (CVE-2026-9467);
  wildcard-CORS / DNS-rebind SSE → CORS-wildcard rule + `AAK-DNS-REBIND-*`
  (CVE-2026-9739); SSRF in MCP tool handlers → `AAK-SSRF-001..005`
  (CVE-2026-10280, CVE-2026-47250); LangChain deserialize / prompt-pull →
  `AAK-LANGCHAIN-001..003` + `AAK-LANGCHAIN-PROMPT-LOADER-PATH-001`
  (CVE-2026-44843, CVE-2026-45134).
- **OpenClaw runtime authz bugs** → tracked via the `AAK-OPENCLAW-PRIVESC-001`
  advisory; upgrade OpenClaw (CVE-2026-35674, -53814, -53818, -53820).
- **Out of static scope / vendor-runtime** (upgrade advisory, no scannable
  user-code pattern): Linux-kernel dm-ioctl (CVE-2026-46294, not MCP),
  Spring-AI/Java path-traversal & DCR-SSRF (CVE-2026-41863, -45609),
  n8n telemetry + multi-tenant fallback (CVE-2026-45582, -45707),
  OpenClaude OAuth-state logic bug (CVE-2026-42073), Roslyn .NET DLL load
  (CVE-2026-45555), LibreChat viewer-secret-exposure & IDOR-spread
  (CVE-2026-44653, CVE-2026-31942), claude-code-cache-fix statusline
  (CVE-2026-45136), mcp-google-workspace (CVE-2026-10277).
- **CVE-2026-44450** (Lumiverse args-injection, 9.9) closed earlier as covered
  by `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-002` + `AAK-MCP-STDIO-LAUNCHER-INJECT-001`.

Rule count **220 → 221**; scanner modules **74 → 75**. Version **0.3.33 →
0.3.34**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-ENV-PLACEHOLDER-EXFIL-001: ${VAR} env-placeholder secret exfiltration (CVE-2026-32625)

CVE-response cycle item (closes #300). New **CRITICAL** rule + scanner
(`scanners/mcp_env_placeholder_exfil.py`) flagging an MCP server that resolves
`${VAR}` / `$VAR` placeholders against its own process environment
(`process.env`, `os.path.expandvars`, `.format(**os.environ)`) while handling a
user-supplied server config/URL. A user submitting
`https://attacker/?k=${JWT_SECRET}` then makes the server interpolate its own
secrets into the outbound request.

[CVE-2026-32625](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-32625): LibreChat
<= 0.8.3 resolved `${VAR}` against `process.env` during Zod validation of
user-supplied MCP server URLs, leaking `CREDS_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `MONGO_URI`
(CWE-200, CVSS 9.6). Maps to **MCP01:2025** (Token Mismanagement), **ASI03**.
TS/JS detection is comment-stripped; gated to MCP-context files. FP guards:
verbatim URL use, plain `process.env` reads, non-MCP files, and a commented-out
pattern all pass.

### Anti-duplicate triage — CVE-2026-44450 closed as covered (no new rule)

CVE-2026-44450 (Lumiverse < 0.9.7, CWE-88, CVSS 9.9 — MCP endpoint allowlists
`command` but forwards `args` unvalidated; allowlisted binaries accept `-e`/`-c`
exec flags) was triaged and **closed as already covered** (#280): the
dynamic-args-to-spawn shape is `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-002` and the
launcher+exec-flag insight is `AAK-MCP-STDIO-LAUNCHER-INJECT-001`. No duplicate
rule added.

Rule count **219 → 220**; scanner modules **73 → 74**; Secret-Exposure category
**17 → 18**. Version **0.3.32 → 0.3.33**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-TOOLGATE-ASYMMETRY-001: tools/list-vs-tools/call enforcement asymmetry (CVE-2026-46519)

CVE-response cycle item. New **HIGH** rule + scanner
(`scanners/mcp_toolgate_asymmetry.py`) flagging an MCP server that gates tools
by an allowlist / read-only / non-destructive control (e.g. `ALLOWED_TOOLS`,
`ALLOW_ONLY_NON_DESTRUCTIVE_TOOLS`, a `*READONLY*` / `*NON_DESTRUCTIVE*` env
var) and applies that check in the **discovery** handler (`tools/list` /
`list_tools` / `ListToolsRequestSchema`) but NOT in the **execution** handler
(`tools/call` / `call_tool` / `CallToolRequestSchema`). A client that calls a
hidden tool name directly bypasses the gate.

This is the [CVE-2026-46519](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-46519)
class: **mcp-server-kubernetes < 3.6.0** documented three env vars as access
controls but enforced them only at the discovery layer (CWE-863 Incorrect
Authorization, CVSS 8.8). Maps to **MCP06:2025** (Privilege Escalation),
**ASI04** + **ASI02**.

- **Python** is analysed with stdlib `ast` (precise per-handler bodies, so
  comments cannot mask the gate); **TS/JS** uses region-sliced regex with
  comment-stripping (a `// TODO: add readOnly check` comment can't create a
  false negative).
- This is an **enforcement-layer asymmetry** — explicitly distinct from
  `AAK-MCPWN-001` (transport-middleware *route* asymmetry, `/mcp_message` vs
  `/mcp`, CVE-2026-33032) and from the stateless-migration smells. Not
  collapsed.
- FP guards: gate-in-both-handlers passes; no-gate-anywhere passes;
  discovery-only (no call handler) passes.

Rule count **218 → 219**; scanner modules **72 → 73**; MCP-Configuration
category **48 → 49**. Version **0.3.31 → 0.3.32**.

### Changed — CrewAI chain: NVD severity reconciliation + evasion-gap closures

Audit of the existing CrewAI four-CVE chain rules (CVE-2026-2275/2285/2286/2287,
CERT/CC VU#221883) against NVD, plus an evasion-gap pass on
`scanners/crewai_rce_chain.py`. No new rule IDs — this corrects and hardens the
existing coverage.

- **Severity reconciliation (NVD CVSS):** `AAK-CREWAI-CVE-2026-2286-001` (RAG
  SSRF, CWE-918) and `AAK-CREWAI-CVE-2026-2287-001` (Docker-liveness fallback,
  CWE-94) are both **CVSS 9.8 CRITICAL** per NVD — bumped **HIGH → CRITICAL**
  (they were under-rated, which understated the score penalty and skipped
  `--fail-on critical` gates). `-2275-001` (CWE-749, 9.6) and `-2285-001`
  (7.5) confirmed already correct; descriptions enriched with the verified
  CWE/CVSS.
- **Evasion-gap closures** in the scanner (all with false-positive guards):
  - **Positional tool args** — `RagTool(user_url)` / `JSONSearchTool(user_path)`
    are now detected, not just the `url=`/`file_path=` keyword forms.
  - **Aliased tool imports** — `from crewai_tools import CodeInterpreterTool as
    CIT; CIT(unsafe_mode=True)` now resolves via an import-alias map.
  - **Import gate** — `import crewai_tools` (plain form) now passes the gate
    (previously only `from crewai_tools import …` did).

A static-literal positional arg and a no-crewai-import file still pass (FP
guards). Version **0.3.30 → 0.3.31**; rule/scanner counts unchanged.

### Added — AAK-MCP-STDIO-LAUNCHER-INJECT-001: MCP stdio launcher injection (CVE-2026-40933 class)

New **HIGH** rule + scanner (`scanners/mcp_stdio_launcher.py`) flagging MCP
**stdio** server definitions (`command` + `args` in a `mcpServers` / `servers`
block) that either launch a shell-style interpreter (`npx`, `node`, `bash`,
`sh`, `python`) with a code-execution flag (`-c`, `-e`, `--eval`), or pass a
non-pinned interpolation token (`${...}` embedded in a larger string,
`{{...}}`, `%s`) in argv.

This is the [CVE-2026-40933](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-40933)
class: **Flowise < 3.1.0** unsafely serialised stdio commands in its MCP
adapter, so an authenticated actor could register a stdio server whose
allowlisted launcher (`npx`) was combined with `-c` to run arbitrary OS
commands (CWE-78, CVSS 9.9). Maps to **MCP04:2025** (Command Injection),
**ASI05** + **ASI02**.

**Why this is not a duplicate** of existing STDIO coverage:
- `AAK-MCP-002` inspects only the `command` *string* for `sh -c`/`bash -c`
  wrappers and shell metacharacters — it never examines `args`, so the
  canonical split form `{"command":"npx","args":["-c","…"]}` was missed.
- `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001..004` are source-code taint analyzers
  (`StdioServerParameters(command=tainted)`), not `.mcp.json` config detectors.
- `AAK-FLOWISE-001` is Flowise-package/`.flowise`-config specific.

This rule is the config-level detector that closes that gap. A **standalone**
env reference (`${VAR}`) is treated as pinned and does not fire; HTTP/SSE MCP
servers (a `url` with no `command`) are out of scope.

Rule count **217 → 218**; scanner modules **71 → 72**; MCP-Configuration
category **47 → 48**. Version **0.3.29 → 0.3.30**.

### Added — AAK-AGENT-SHARED-RES-AUTHZ-001: shared-resource mutating op without per-actor authz (CVE-2026-44654 class)

New **HIGH** rule + scanner (`scanners/shared_resource_authz.py`) flagging
tool/function/MCP descriptors that expose a **mutating** operation
(delete / remove / edit / update / overwrite / move) on a file/record/resource
reachable in a **shared or multi-agent** context, when the input schema carries
**no per-actor authorization field** (owner / actor / authorization /
permission / `on_behalf_of` / …). Any agent that can call the tool could then
mutate another principal's resource.

This is the [CVE-2026-44654](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-44654)
broken-access-control class: **LibreChat <= 0.8.3** let a shared-agent editor
delete file records via `DELETE /api/files` that the owner had reused across
multiple agents (CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization, CVSS 8.1). Maps to
**MCP06:2025** (Privilege Escalation), **ASI04** (Identity & Privilege Abuse) +
**ASI02** (Tool Misuse).

- Requires **three** signals to fire (low false-positive by design): a mutate
  **verb _and_ a resource noun** in the tool name/description; a **shared
  context** — inferred from a multi-agent config (an `agents` collection with
  >1 member, or a `shared` / `scope: shared|workspace|team|org` marker) or from
  shared-resource language in the tool's own name/description; **and** the
  absence of any owner/actor/authorization property in the schema.
- **Opt-out:** a tool annotated `"x-aak-shared-authz": "global-ok"` (the
  resource is intentionally global to all agents) is suppressed.

Rule count **216 → 217**; scanner modules **70 → 71**; Trust-Boundary category
**11 → 12**. Version **0.3.28 → 0.3.29**.

### Added — AAK-MCP-SANDBOX-SELFDISABLE-001: LLM-settable sandbox-disable parameter (CVE-2026-42074 class)

New **CRITICAL** rule + scanner (`scanners/sandbox_self_disable.py`) flagging
tool/function JSON schemas and MCP tool descriptors that expose a parameter
whose name disables or weakens sandboxing/isolation
(`dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, `disable_sandbox`, `no_sandbox`, `allow_unsafe`,
`skip_isolation`, …) inside the model-facing `properties` — i.e. a flag the
LLM, an untrusted principal, can set in any `tool_use` response to turn off the
sandbox that contains tool execution.

This is the [CVE-2026-42074](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-42074)
class: **OpenClaude < 0.5.1** shipped `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` as part of
the BashTool input schema (CWE-284 / CWE-306, CVSS 9.8). Maps to
**MCP06:2025** (Privilege Escalation), **ASI06** (Unauthorized Capability
Acquisition) + **ASI04** (Identity & Privilege Abuse).

- Scans JSON-Schema `properties` under the standard tool-schema containers
  (`inputSchema` / `input_schema` / `parameters`) plus bare schema files;
  recurses nested object/array/`anyOf` params. Matches on the parameter
  **name**, not description text (that remains tool-poisoning's job).
- **Allowlist (pass with note):** a sandbox-control flag declared not
  LLM-settable — `readOnly: true`, `"x-aak-sandbox-control": "ops-only"`
  (also `operator-only` / `server-only`), or `"x-llm-settable": false` — is
  suppressed, since it is asserted to be host-set, not request-set.

Rule count **215 → 216**; scanner modules **69 → 70**; Trust-Boundary category
**10 → 11**. Version **0.3.27 → 0.3.28**.

### Changed — NSA MCP Security CSI mapping: coverage-gap audit (17 rules added)

A gap audit of the `nsa-mcp-csi-2026` compliance mapping (originally added in
PR #294) found rules that plainly evidence an existing CSI recommendation but
were never cited — and, in three cases, carry **no OWASP-Agentic ASI tag**, so
the `also_covers_asi` fan-out could never reach them. **17 rules** are now
explicitly mapped across 8 of the 9 CSI recommendation sections:

- **Constrain and sandbox tool execution (p.11)** — `AAK-HOOK-RCE-002`,
  `AAK-HOOK-RCE-003` (the same family as the already-cited `-001`), and generic
  egress SSRF `AAK-SSRF-001` / `-004` / `-005` (the v1 map cited only
  vendor-specific SSRF).
- **Scan local network for open/vulnerable MCP servers (p.14)** —
  `AAK-SSRF-002` (loopback reach), `AAK-SSRF-003` (cloud-metadata reach).
- **Validate parameters (p.11)** — `AAK-MCP-015` (path traversal in MCP
  resource handler), `AAK-LANGCHAIN-001` / `-002` (`load_prompt` path traversal).
- **Design for boundaries (p.10)** — `AAK-A2A-009` (unbounded delegation).
- **Sign and verify MCP messages (p.12)** — `AAK-A2A-004` (plaintext HTTP).
- **Instrument for logging and detection (p.13)** — `AAK-AGENT-004`.
- **Filter and monitor output pipelines (p.12)** — `AAK-AGENT-005`.
- **Track and patch MCP related vulnerabilities (p.13)** — `AAK-MCPFRAME-001`,
  `AAK-MCP-STATELESS-002` (ASI-less), `AAK-CLAUDE-WIN-001`.

Explicit NSA-cited rules went **94 → 111**. Thirteen rules remain deliberately
unmapped (internal sentinel, info-only coverage manifests, privacy-policy-doc,
frontend-DoS, pricing, and EU-locale-eval rules) — mapping them would fabricate
coverage; a new `test_deliberate_exclusions_stay_out_of_scope` test documents
and guards that decision. NSA test suite **25 → 43**.

**No new rule ID, no new framework, no version bump** — this only enriches an
existing framework's rule-to-control map.

### Changed — TS/JS taint scanner now covers SQL-injection sinks (AAK-TAINT-005 parity)

The TypeScript/JavaScript pattern scanner
(`agent_audit_kit/scanners/typescript_pattern_scan.py`) now flags raw /
interpolated SQL execution sinks under the existing **`AAK-TAINT-005`**
rule ("Tool parameter flows to SQL query"), closing a language-parity gap:
the Python taint engine (`cursor`/`connection`/`session.execute`) and the
Rust scanner (`sql!`/`query!` with `format!`) already implemented
`AAK-TAINT-005`, but the TS/JS scanner omitted it — despite its own module
docstring claiming "SQL template" coverage.

New sink matches (low false-positive by design — parameterized queries with
placeholder args are **not** flagged):

- Prisma `$queryRawUnsafe(...)` / `$executeRawUnsafe(...)` (explicitly-unsafe APIs)
- `knex` / driver `.raw(` + interpolated template literal
- `.query(...)` / `.execute(...)` with `${...}` template-literal interpolation
- `.query(...)` / `.execute(...)` with string concatenation

**No new rule ID, no version bump** — this extends an existing rule and an
existing scanner. Rule / scanner / category counts unchanged.

**Anti-duplicate result: `[DROP new rule — class already covered;
REFRAMED to the one real gap: TS/JS SQL-sink parity for AAK-TAINT-005]`.**

A prompt asked to add an "MCP-SDK / MCP-server RCE + tool-poisoning"
detector for the OX Security April-2026 disclosure. The class is already
covered end-to-end, so a new rule would duplicate:

- `AAK-STDIO-001` (CRITICAL, **OX-MCP-2026-04-15**) — taint to `subprocess` /
  `os.system` / `os.popen` / `eval` / `exec`.
- `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001..004` (CRITICAL, **OX-MCP-2026-04-25**) —
  network-controlled input to Stdio params (Python / TS / Java / Rust).
- `AAK-ANTHROPIC-SDK-001` (HIGH, **OX-MCP-2026-04-15**) — upstream SDK
  STDIO transport without an argv sanitizer.
- `AAK-MCP-TOOL-UNSAFE-EVAL-001` — `eval`/`exec`/`compile` inside an
  `@mcp.tool` handler.
- `AAK-TAINT-005` (Python + Rust) — SQL sink; plus named SQLi pins
  `AAK-DORIS-001` and `AAK-ASTROMCP-SQLI-CVE-2026-7591-001`.

The request's secondary ask — "flag MCP SDK versions pinned below the
patched release for the disclosed RCE" — rests on a false premise: the OX
2026-04-15 STDIO/RCE class has **no patched SDK release** (Anthropic
declined to CVE it; sanitization is the developer's responsibility), which
is why `AAK-ANTHROPIC-SDK-001` is a sanitizer-presence check rather than a
version pin. (A parameterized, updatable SDK version-floor check already
exists for a *different* class — `AAK-DNS-REBIND-002`, the DNS-rebinding
fix.) No fabricated CVE was introduced; the work is labelled to the **OX
Security MCP-SDK disclosure class** only.

The single genuine gap was TS/JS SQL-sink parity, addressed here by
extending `AAK-TAINT-005` rather than adding a duplicate rule.

**Tests:** 7 new in `tests/test_typescript_pattern_scan_sql.py` (the TS
pattern scanner previously had no dedicated test) — interpolated-template
SQL caught, string-concatenated SQL caught, Prisma `$queryRawUnsafe`
caught, `knex.raw` interpolation caught, parameterized query passes,
static parameter-free query passes, non-MCP file not scanned.

### Changed — MCP tool-poisoning now scans per-parameter descriptions

The tool-poisoning scanner (`agent_audit_kit/scanners/tool_poisoning.py`)
now feeds the existing `AAK-POISON-001..006` detectors with **every
per-parameter description** under a tool's input schema, not just the
tool's top-level `description` and the schema-level `inputSchema.description`.
`_extract_tool_descriptions` recursively walks
`inputSchema.properties.<param>.description` (plus `input_schema` and the
OpenAI `parameters` container), descending through nested object
properties, array `items`, and `anyOf`/`allOf`/`oneOf` combinators (depth
cap 6). This closes the indirect-prompt-injection-in-tool-metadata gap
where instruction text hides in a single argument's docstring rather than
the tool description. Findings are labelled `…/param:<dotted.path>` so they
point at the exact poisoned parameter.

**No new rule ID** — this is a coverage extension to the existing
`AAK-POISON-*` family. Rule count, scanner count, and category counts are
unchanged.

**Anti-duplicate result: `[REFRAMED — extends AAK-POISON-001..006 via
per-parameter sub-detector]`.** A prompt proposed a new MCP tool-poisoning
rule anchored to **CVE-2026-44338**. Declined as a new rule for two
reasons:

1. **Tool-poisoning shape already covered.** Indirect prompt injection via
   tool description/metadata is detected by `AAK-POISON-001` (invisible
   Unicode), `-002` (prompt-injection / role-switching markers), `-003`
   (cross-tool chaining), `-004` (encoded content), `-005` (length),
   `-006` (URL/path), plus `AAK-MCP-FHI-001` (imperative-override
   language). The only genuine gap was *parameter-level* descriptions,
   addressed by this extension rather than a duplicate rule.
2. **CVE mis-classification.** Per NVD, **CVE-2026-44338** is *PraisonAI*
   shipping a legacy Flask API server with **authentication disabled by
   default** (CWE-306 / CWE-668 / CWE-1188, CVSS 7.3, published
   2026-05-08) — an **auth-bypass**, not tool-metadata poisoning. Citing
   it on an `AAK-POISON-*` finding would encode a false CVE-to-attack
   mapping, so the CVE is **not** referenced by this change. (PraisonAI's
   Flask auth-bypass is a separate, currently-uncovered gap that would
   belong to the auth-bypass family — e.g. `AAK-MCP-SERVER-AUTH-*` — if
   pursued later; it was out of scope for this tool-poisoning request.)
   Source: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-44338>.

**Tests:** 5 new in `tests/test_tool_poisoning.py` — poisoned single
param caught (with `param:<name>` evidence), nested-object param caught,
array-item param caught, OpenAI `parameters` container walked, and a
benign manifest with ordinary parameter docstrings producing **zero**
findings (false-positive guard).

**Headline: New rule pack `AAK-MCP-TUNNEL-001..003` (3 rules) for the
Anthropic MCP Tunnels research preview (launched 2026-05-19). Every
detection pattern is grounded in the official proxy-config schema at
`platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/reference` —
field names taken verbatim from the reference table — so the rules
catch real misconfigurations rather than invented schema shapes. Also
adds `iso42001` (ISO/IEC 42001:2023 AI Management System) as a
first-class entry in `FRAMEWORKS`, closing a long-standing gap where
the `--framework iso42001` CLI choice existed but its runtime crosswalk
did not.**

### Added

- **`AAK-MCP-TUNNEL-001`** *(MCP Configuration; CRITICAL; CWE-918)* —
  MCP Tunnels gateway proxy has `upstream.disable_ip_validation: true`
  OR an `upstream.allowed_ips` CIDR that covers the public internet
  (`0.0.0.0/0`, `::/0`, or an IPv4 prefix ≤ `/7`). The reference page
  calls `upstream.allowed_ips` the proxy's *"primary SSRF defense"*;
  disabling or widening it lets a malicious upstream-side process
  reach arbitrary hosts the proxy can route to.
- **`AAK-MCP-TUNNEL-002`** *(MCP Configuration; HIGH; CWE-295)* — an
  `https://` upstream is declared under `routes:` but neither
  `upstream.tls.ca_file` nor `upstream.tls.include_system_cas: true`
  is set. Quoting the reference: *"otherwise the proxy has no trust
  anchor for the upstream certificate."*
- **`AAK-MCP-TUNNEL-003`** *(MCP Configuration; CRITICAL; CWE-798)* —
  tunnel token or server TLS private key is checked into the repo or
  pinned as a literal value in a CI workflow. Triggers on literal
  `MCP_TUNNEL_TOKEN` / `TUNNEL_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_TUNNEL_TOKEN` /
  `TUNNELS_API_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN` env values in
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `azure-pipelines.yml`,
  `.circleci/config.yml`; PEM private keys committed under
  MCP-Tunnels paths (`mcp-tunnel/`, `mcp-gateway/`, `mcp-tunnels/`,
  etc.); and `kind: Secret` manifests named `mcp-tunnel` /
  `mcp-tunnel-token` / `mcp-tunnel-cert` carrying inline `data:`
  values. Suppresses on `${{ secrets.NAME }}` / `secrets.NAME` /
  `env.NAME` references and on empty placeholder Secrets.
- **`iso42001`** framework entry in `agent_audit_kit/output/compliance.py`
  `FRAMEWORKS`. Maps ISO/IEC 42001:2023 clauses 6.1.2 / 6.1.3 / 8.2 /
  8.3 and Annex A controls (A.5.1, A.6.2.3, A.6.2.4, A.6.2.6, A.7.4,
  A.8.2, A.8.3, A.10.1) to OWASP-Agentic ASI tokens, so existing rules
  with `owasp_agentic_references` automatically land under the right
  clauses. The `--framework iso42001` CLI choice and the PDF report's
  category mapping pre-existed; the runtime crosswalk was missing.
- **`nsa-mcp-csi-2026`** framework entry mapping the **NSA AISC
  Cybersecurity Information Sheet** "Model Context Protocol (MCP):
  Security Design Considerations for AI-Driven Automation"
  (**U/OO/6030316-26 | PP-26-1834, May 2026 Ver. 1.0**, published
  2026-05-20). The CSI body is prose with 9 named recommendation
  sections (pp.10-14); each is mapped here to the **exact AAK rule IDs
  that evidence it** (102 unique rule citations across the 9
  recommendations) AND a fan-out set of OWASP-Agentic ASI tokens so
  future rule additions auto-light the relevant control. This is a
  *mapping over existing rules* — no new scanner, no new rule IDs.
  Wired into `--framework nsa-mcp-csi-2026` (`report` command) and
  `--compliance nsa-mcp-csi-2026` (`scan` command); registered in
  `pdf_report._FRAMEWORK_TITLES` and `_CATEGORY_TO_CONTROL` for the
  PDF / text-report's `Findings by control` grouping. The 9 mapped
  recommendations, verbatim from the CSI:
    1. *Choose supported MCP projects when possible* (p.10)
    2. *Design for boundaries* (p.10)
    3. *Validate parameters* (p.11)
    4. *Constrain and sandbox tool execution* (p.11)
    5. *Sign and verify MCP messages* (p.12)
    6. *Filter and monitor output pipelines and chained execution* (p.12)
    7. *Instrument for logging and detection* (p.13)
    8. *Track and patch MCP related vulnerabilities* (p.13)
    9. *Scan local network for open or vulnerable MCP servers* (p.14)
  Source citation block at the head of every NSA CSI report includes
  the verbatim doc ID, title, publisher, publication date, and PDF
  URL so output is independently auditable. Primary source: NSA
  <https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/75/documents/Cybersecurity/CSI_MCP_SECURITY.pdf>,
  press release
  <https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/4496698/>.
- **Schema extension** to `agent_audit_kit/output/compliance.py`: the
  per-control value in `FRAMEWORKS[*]["controls"]` now accepts either
  the legacy `list[str]` of ASI tokens (existing 7 frameworks
  unchanged) OR a `dict` with `rule_ids` (curated direct mapping) +
  optional `also_covers_asi` (ASI fan-out). New `_resolve_control_rules`
  helper dispatches on the value type. Existing frameworks need no
  change.
- Optional **`source` block** on a framework entry; when present,
  `format_results` emits a verbatim citation header (doc ID, title,
  publisher, date, URL). Other frameworks can opt in by adding the
  block; the NSA CSI entry is the first user.

### Changed

- **`agent_audit_kit/scanners/mcp_tunnel.py`** is a new scanner module
  (PyYAML-parsed). Registered via `_OPTIONAL_SCANNERS` so missing
  PyYAML degrades gracefully rather than breaking scans.
- **Compliance surface**: every TUNNEL rule carries
  `owasp_agentic_references` between `ASI02..ASI06`, so findings auto-land
  under EU AI Act **Article 15** (Robustness & Security), SOC 2
  **CC6.1 / CC6.3 / CC6.7**, ISO 27001 **A.8.24 / A.5.23**, HIPAA
  **164.312(d)**, and the new ISO 42001 clauses without any
  per-framework rewiring.
- **README**: `<!-- rule-count -->` anchors auto-sync to **215** rules,
  MCP Configuration category count to **47**, scanner count to **69**.
  Category description extends with the MCP Tunnels gateway items.

### Notes

- No version bump in this changeset. Release cadence + tag/PyPI/GHCR/
  Sigstore is intentionally a separate flow.
- The MCP Tunnels feature is in *research preview*. Anthropic's docs
  state: *"They are provided 'as-is' without any uptime, support, or
  continuity commitment, and they depend on a third-party network
  provider (Cloudflare) that makes no availability commitment for the
  underlying transport. Anthropic may modify or discontinue MCP
  tunnels at any time."* The rule pack will need a refresh whenever
  the proxy config schema changes upstream.

## [0.3.27] - 2026-05-28

**Headline: New advisory rule `AAK-MCP-ATTEST-001` — flags MCP server
entries in the agent/host config that are dispatched without any of: a
referenced signed clearance assertion, a `/.well-known/mcp-clearance`
(or configured) URI, or a pinned trust root. Surfaces the
deny-by-default server-admission gap from Metere 2026 (arXiv:2605.24248,
"Attested Tool-Server Admission") as a static finding so MCP hosts can
adopt the proposed addendum incrementally — an unattested config keeps
working but is now visible in SARIF, the OWASP MCP Top 10 mapping
(MCP07:2025), and the EU AI Act Art. 15 / SOC 2 compliance surface
(via ASI03 + ASI04).**

Citations:

- Metere 2026, "Attested Tool-Server Admission: A Security Extension to
  the Model Context Protocol", **arXiv:2605.24248** — small,
  offline-signed clearance assertion at a well-known URI, pinned trust
  root verification before tool dispatch, deny-by-default per-server
  tool allowlist, flavor-gated enforcement mode, RFC-2119 normative
  schema + machine-checkable conformance vectors. An unextended host
  ignores the well-known document and behaves exactly as today, so the
  static evidence we look for is the host's *opt-in*:
  per-server attestation field, `MCP-Clearance` header, named
  `.well-known/mcp-clearance` URI, or host-level pinned `trust_root`.

### Added

- **`AAK-MCP-ATTEST-001`** *(MCP Configuration; advisory / medium)* —
  fires once per dispatched-but-unattested MCP server entry. Suppressed
  by any one of:
  - Per-server `attestation` / `clearance` / `clearance_url` /
    `clearance_uri` / `clearance_document` / `mcp_clearance` field, or
    aliased per-server `trust_root` / `trust_anchor` /
    `pinned_trust_root`.
  - An `MCP-Clearance` / `MCP-Attestation` / `X-MCP-Clearance` header
    on the server entry (transport-level carrier).
  - The well-known URI `.well-known/mcp-clearance` named anywhere in
    the server entry.
  - A host-level pinned `trust_root` / `trust_anchor` /
    `trusted_roots` / `mcp_clearance_trust_root` /
    `attestation_trust_root` (one pin covers every server in the file).
  - Stub server entries without `url` or `command` are skipped (other
    rules already catch those).
- SARIF: emitted with `security-severity` and
  `primaryLocationFingerprint`, consistent with sibling `AAK-MCP-*`
  rules. Listed in the OWASP MCP Top 10 cross-reference under
  **MCP07:2025**.
- Compliance: lands under EU AI Act **Article 15** (Robustness &
  Security), SOC 2 **CC6.1 / CC6.3 / CC6.7**, ISO 27001 **A.8.24 /
  A.5.23**, HIPAA **164.312(d)** automatically via the
  `ASI03` + `ASI04` OWASP-Agentic mapping, with no `compliance.py`
  schema change.

### Changed

- `tests/fixtures/clean_mcp.json` — added a host-level `trust_root` so
  the long-standing "clean MCP config produces zero findings"
  invariant survives `AAK-MCP-ATTEST-001`'s introduction.
- README: per-category description for *MCP Configuration* extends
  with the deny-by-default attested-admission item; `<!-- rule-count
  -->` anchors auto-sync to **212** rules, MCP Configuration category
  count to **44**.

## [0.3.26] - 2026-05-26

**Headline: New advisory rule `AAK-EU-AI-ACT-ART15-LOCALE-001` — flags
multilingual user-facing agent configs that lack per-locale eval / test
coverage, surfacing the gap as auditor-ready evidence under EU AI Act
Article 15 (Accuracy, Robustness & Cybersecurity). The `eu-ai-act`
compliance report grows a dedicated *Article 15 — Accuracy, Robustness
& Cybersecurity (evidence)* subsection beneath the existing Art. 15
PASS/FAIL row, with two stable line items: `multilingual-locale-declared`
and `multilingual-eval-coverage`.**

Citations:

  tracking per-locale eval coverage as Art. 15 evidence.
  <https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.23157>

### Added — Legal Compliance

- **`AAK-EU-AI-ACT-ART15-LOCALE-001`** (INFO / advisory,
  Category.LEGAL_COMPLIANCE) — fires when all hold: (1) a repo agent /
  safety / eval config (`agent.yaml`, `agents.yaml`, `crew.yaml`,
  `manifest.yaml`, `safety.yaml`, `eval.yaml`, …) declares ≥ 2 locales
  via `locales:` / `languages:` / `supported_languages:` / individual
  `locale:` keys (ISO-639-1 with optional BCP-47 region suffix
  collapsed); (2) the same config marks the agent user-facing —
  explicit `user_facing: true`, `surface:` containing
  `end-user`/`user-facing`/`public`, or role string in
  `{assistant, chatbot, support, agent, concierge, helper, advisor,
  tutor, companion}`; (3) the union of locale codes derived from
  `evals/`, `eval/`, `evaluation/`, `evaluations/`, `fixtures/`,
  `scenarios/`, `i18n/`, `locales/`, `test_data/`, `testdata/`, or
  `benchmarks/` paths covers fewer than two of the declared locales.
  The rule **carries no OWASP-Agentic ASI tag** — it surfaces through
  the dedicated `compliance.py` Art. 15 evidence subsection rather than
  the ASI-driven PASS/FAIL summary, so a single coverage gap does not
  flip the Art. 15 control to FAIL.

- **`agent_audit_kit/scanners/eu_ai_act_art15_locale.py`** — new
  scanner module wired into `_OPTIONAL_SCANNERS`. 12-case test matrix
  in `tests/test_eu_ai_act_art15_locale.py`: rule registration shape,
  scanner-engine wiring, positive (multilingual + en-only eval),
  negative (multilingual + multi-locale eval coverage, single-locale
  agent, internal/non-user-facing multilingual agent, no-config repo),
  documented-risk opt-out, report subsection renders both with and
  without findings, advisory finding does NOT flip the Art. 15 control
  to FAIL, subsection appears only under `--compliance eu-ai-act`.

### Changed — Compliance report

- `agent_audit_kit/output/compliance.py` — the eu-ai-act framework now
  emits an *Article 15 — Accuracy, Robustness & Cybersecurity
  (evidence)* sub-block under its Art. 15 control row only. Default
  lines on a clean scan:

  ```
  Article 15 — Accuracy, Robustness & Cybersecurity (evidence)
    multilingual-locale-declared: n/a (no multilingual user-facing agent config detected)
    multilingual-eval-coverage: evidenced or not applicable (no Art. 15 locale-coverage finding)
  ```

  On a positive finding:

  ```
  Article 15 — Accuracy, Robustness & Cybersecurity (evidence)
    multilingual-locale-declared: 3 locale(s) (de, en, fr)
    multilingual-eval-coverage: not evidenced — covered=[en], 1 finding(s) (AAK-EU-AI-ACT-ART15-LOCALE-001)
  ```

  Other frameworks (`soc2`, `iso27001`, `hipaa`, `nist-ai-rmf`,
  `mcp-2026-roadmap`) are unchanged — the subsection is keyed on
  `framework_key == "eu-ai-act"` and the control label starting with
  `Art. 15`.

### Suppression

- New `.agent-audit-kit.yml` opt-out key:
  ```yaml
  accepts_locale_coverage_gap: true
  justification: "describe why per-locale eval is intentionally absent"
  ```
  Suppresses `AAK-EU-AI-ACT-ART15-LOCALE-001` for projects whose
  per-locale eval lives outside the scanned tree.

### Changed — Counts

- Bundle ships 211 rules (was 210); LEGAL_COMPLIANCE category row in
  README "What It Scans" goes 11 → 12 via the per-category anchor.
  Scanner count 67 → 68. Shields.io badge auto-rewritten by
  `sync_rule_count.py` / `sync_scanner_count.py`.

## [0.3.25] - 2026-05-25

**Headline: New rule family `AAK-MCP-STATELESS-001..004` — flags MCP
server / client code that assumes the pre-2026-07-28 stateful protocol.
The 2026-07-28 spec release candidate (locked 2026-05-21) makes the
protocol stateless by default: the `Mcp-Session-Id` header and the
protocol-level session are removed (SEP-1442), and the experimental
`tasks/list` method is removed because it can't be scoped safely without
sessions (SEP-1359). Code relying on the pre-RC shape will silently
break once the final spec lands on 2026-07-28.**

Sources:

- <https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/>
- <https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-12-19-mcp-transport-future/>
- <https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1442> — SEP-1442 (stateless by default)
- <https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1359> — SEP-1359 (protocol-level sessions removed)

### Added — MCP Configuration

- **`AAK-MCP-STATELESS-001`** (HIGH) — fires when source code under a
  declared MCP SDK reads, writes, or constants the `Mcp-Session-Id`
  header (or the snake-case Python variant `MCP_SESSION_ID`). After the
  2026-07-28 cutover the header and the session it represented are
  gone; any request can land on any server instance, so sticky routing
  + shared session stores at the protocol layer are no longer
  guaranteed. Fix hint: route on the new `Mcp-Method` header, persist
  per-server state behind an out-of-band identity (auth subject, OAuth
  `sub`, tool argument). Maps to OWASP MCP07:2025, ASI03, AICM IAM-01 /
  AIS-08.
- **`AAK-MCP-STATELESS-002`** (HIGH) — fires when code dispatches or
  handles the removed `tasks/list` JSON-RPC method (`"tasks/list"`
  literal, `tasks.list(...)` / `tasks_list(...)` SDK alias). Tasks moves
  out of the core specification into the new Extensions framework; the
  stateful list surface has no stateless successor. Maps to OWASP
  MCP07:2025, AICM AIS-07 / AIS-08.
- **`AAK-MCP-STATELESS-003`** (MEDIUM) — fires on infrastructure
  manifests that require sticky routing for an MCP backend (nginx
  `ip_hash` / `sticky`, Kubernetes `sessionAffinity: ClientIP`, Traefik
  / ALB sticky cookies) OR on handler code that reads a shared session
  store keyed on a per-connection id used across requests
  (`session_store[session_id]` and friends). Infra-side findings fire
  when either the project declares an MCP SDK or the manifest itself
  mentions MCP; code-side findings are gated on the SDK. Maps to
  OWASP MCP07:2025, AICM IVS-04 / BCR-04.
- **`AAK-MCP-STATELESS-004`** (LOW, advisory) — fires when a client
  file calls `tools/list` / `list_tools` at least twice in the same
  file with no caching marker nearby (`lru_cache`, `TTLCache`,
  `cached_property`, `cachetools`, `tools_list_cache`, `cached_tools`,
  `memoize`, `functools.cache`, `ttlMs` / `ttl_ms` / `ttlSeconds`) AND
  the file references per-session state. Stateless transport may serve
  a different instance per request — un-cached repeated discovery
  multiplies round-trips and may surface a different tool catalog each
  time. Maps to OWASP MCP07:2025, AICM AIS-07.

- **`agent_audit_kit/scanners/mcp_stateless_migration.py`** — new
  scanner module wired into the `_OPTIONAL_SCANNERS` registry. Reuses
  the `_declares_sdk` predicate pattern from `mcp_sampling_capability`.
  16-case test matrix in `tests/test_mcp_stateless_migration.py`:
  positive + negative for each sub-detector, plus the cross-cutting
  `.agent-audit-kit.yml accepts_stateless_migration_risk: true`
  opt-out, a clean stateless-server fixture, an OWASP-mapping
  assertion, and an engine-wiring guard.

### Changed — Counts

- Bundle ships 210 rules (was 206). `MCP_CONFIG` category row in
  README "What It Scans" goes 39 → 43 via the per-category anchor;
  shields.io badge auto-rewritten by `sync_rule_count.py`.

### Suppression

- New `.agent-audit-kit.yml` opt-out key:
  ```yaml
  accepts_stateless_migration_risk: true
  justification: "describe why your project intentionally lives on the pre-2026-07-28 stateful transport"
  ```
  Suppresses every `AAK-MCP-STATELESS-*` finding for projects that are
  knowingly retiring before the cutover.

## [0.3.24] - 2026-05-23

**Headline: New rule `AAK-MCP-SAMPLING-001` — flags MCP servers / clients
that wire up the `sampling` capability (MCP 2025-06-18 §6.3) without an
`elicitation/create` consent prompt or human-approval flag.**

### Added — MCP Configuration

- **`AAK-MCP-SAMPLING-001`** (HIGH, Category.MCP_CONFIG) — fires when ALL
  hold: (1) a manifest declares an MCP SDK (Python / TS / Java / Rust),
  (2) a repo file participates in the `sampling` capability (declares
  `capabilities.sampling`, calls `sampling/createMessage` /
  `create_message`, installs a `CreateMessageRequestSchema` handler, or
  imports `SamplingCapability`), (3) no consent / elicitation marker is
  present (`elicitation/create`, `ElicitRequestSchema`, `elicit_*`,
  `requires_consent`, `human_in_the_loop`, `confirmSampling`, etc.),
  (4) `.agent-audit-kit.yml` does NOT carry
  `accepts_sampling_risk: true` with a non-empty `justification:`. Also
  fires when an MCP config file (`.mcp.json` family) lists `"sampling"`
  in a per-server `capabilities` block without a sibling
  `requires_consent` / `human_in_the_loop` flag (catches host-side
  allow-listing). Maps to OWASP MCP07:2025 + MCP02:2025, ASI03, AICM
  IAM-01 / AIS-07.

- **`agent_audit_kit/scanners/mcp_sampling_capability.py`** — new
  scanner module wired into the `_OPTIONAL_SCANNERS` registry. Reuses
  the `_declares_sdk` predicate pattern from `mcp_sdk_hardening.py`.
  10-case test matrix in `tests/test_mcp_sampling_capability.py`:
  Python/TS vulnerable, Python elicit-gated, documented-risk opt-out,
  `.mcp.json` declared / `requires_consent` gated, SDK-absent silence,
  SDK-present-sampling-absent silence, prose-mention silence, and
  OWASP-mapping assertion.

### Changed — Counts

- Bundle ships 206 rules (was 205). `MCP_CONFIG` category row in
  README "What It Scans" goes 38 → 39 via the per-category anchor;
  shields.io badge auto-rewritten by `sync_rule_count.py`.

## [0.3.23] - 2026-05-20

**Headline: README per-category anchor sync — closes the 81-rule
undercount the "What It Scans" table was carrying against the live
registry (no rule changes; docs + sync-script + regression test).**

### Fixed — Documentation drift (docs-only)

- **README "What It Scans" table** — at v0.3.22 ship the table summed
  to **124 rules** vs the registry's 205 (badge + `RULE_COUNT` were
  correct; only the per-category cells drifted). Every category cell
  was undercount; Supply Chain alone was off by +28. Each of the 11
  category rows now carries an HTML anchor in the form
  `<!-- category-count:CATEGORY_NAME -->NN<!-- /category-count -->`
  (matching the live `Category` enum name verbatim), and the prose
  has been refreshed to mention every rule shipped through this week
  (Tasks-primitive leakage, OAuth 2.1 DPoP, OX MCP-STDIO command
  injection, `apache-doris-mcp-server`, `excel-mcp-server`, MCP
  Calculate Server, Project Deal economic-drift, Metis POMDP,
  SkillsVote attribution, Code-as-Harness, MCP Inspector vendored
  fork, DNS-rebinding, transport-flip MITM, etc.).

### Added — Tooling

- **`scripts/sync_rule_count.py`** now also rewrites every
  `<!-- category-count:NAME -->NN<!-- /category-count -->` anchor in
  README in lockstep with the registry, and exits 1 with a typo guard
  if the README references a `Category` enum name the registry does
  not have. Regex character class is `[A-Z0-9_]+` so `A2A_PROTOCOL`
  matches (the digit was load-bearing — the regression test below
  caught a silent skip).

- **`tests/test_repo_metadata_sync.py::test_readme_per_category_anchors_match_registry`** —
  new regression test that locks every per-category anchor to
  `Counter(r.category.name for r in RULES.values())` and asserts the
  sum matches the live total. Future drift will fail CI rather than
  ship undetected.

### Why this is a separate release

The v0.3.22 release notes already shipped — the table drift is
docs-only, but it materially understates how much surface the
scanner covers (124 vs 205). Re-tagging today fixes the public
README without rewriting v0.3.22 history.

## [0.3.22] - 2026-05-20

**Headline: 2 new research-grade MEDIUM rules (205 total) anchored
to two arXiv papers verified 2026-05-18 — SkillsVote lifecycle
attribution + Code-as-Harness multi-agent shared-state.**

### Added — Rules (2, research-grade)

- **AAK-SKILL-LIFECYCLE-ATTRIBUTION-001** (MEDIUM) — Python AST
  detector for `@skill` / `@register_skill` / etc. decorated
  functions (or `execute` / `run_skill` / `invoke_skill` functions
  in a `skill` / `skills` / `agent-skills` directory) that mutate
  persistent state (file write, DB commit, side-effecting HTTP
  verb) without emitting an outcome-attribution call
  (`record_outcome` / `log_outcome` / `attribute_*` / etc.). Per
  *SkillsVote: Lifecycle Governance of Agent Skills* (Liu et al.,
  arXiv:2605.18401, 2026-05-18), the evidence-gated update loop
  depends on per-execution attribution; missing attribution
  silently degrades repeat invocations.

  New scanner: `agent_audit_kit/scanners/skill_lifecycle_attribution.py`.

- **AAK-AGENT-HARNESS-SHARED-STATE-001** (MEDIUM) — Python AST
  detector for module-level mutable objects (`dict` / `list` /
  `set`) mutated by methods of ≥2 distinct Agent / Worker /
  Harness classes without a lock primitive (`threading.Lock` /
  `asyncio.Lock` / etc.) visible in any of the mutating function
  bodies. Per *Code as Agent Harness* (Ning et al.,
  arXiv:2605.18747, 2026-05-18 — survey of 110+ papers + 23
  systems), "consistent shared state across multiple agents" is
  named as an explicit open challenge for harness engineering.

  New scanner: `agent_audit_kit/scanners/agent_harness_shared_state.py`.

**Both rules MEDIUM (research-grade tier)** because the source
papers identify the failure shape but do not prescribe specific
code patterns. Rules catch the most concrete extrapolations:
attribution-call presence (SkillsVote) and lock-hint presence
(Code-as-Harness). False positives are expected when projects use
project-local naming for outcome records or external coordinators
(database transaction, message queue) for serialization.

### Declined — invented YAML schemas

The 2026-05-20 daily prompt proposed `requires_search: true` and
`depends_on` YAML frontmatter checks anchored to SkillsVote. **Both
field names are invented** — the paper does not define them.
Declined to ship; tracking issue can be filed if a future paper
prescribes an actual schema.

### Triage closures (no rule shipped)

- **#272 CVE-2026-2611** (MLflow 3.9.0 `/ajax-api` origin-validation
  bypass) — class-covered by `AAK-TRUST-001..005` (origin / CORS /
  allowlist) + `AAK-OAUTH-001..005`. Named pin-floor on `mlflow<3.9.1`
  is a v0.3.23+ candidate if a fresh CVE warrants.

### Tests

- 6 new tests in `tests/test_v0_3_22_rules.py`: 3 SkillsVote
  (unsafe fires, safe with `record_outcome` passes, no-decorator-
  outside-skills-path passes); 3 Code-as-Harness (unsafe multi-
  agent fires, safe-with-lock passes, single-agent-no-fire). Total
  **980 passing** (was 974 at v0.3.21 baseline, +6).

### Two scanner bugs caught + fixed pre-commit

- Skill scanner path-detection was too permissive (any-substring
  match on "skill" → false-positive on pytest tmp_path directories
  named `test_skill_*`). Tightened to exact-segment match against
  `{skill, skills, agent-skills, .skills, skill-pack}`.
- Harness scanner missed `ast.AnnAssign` form (`_SHARED: dict = {}`)
  — only walked `ast.Assign`. Added AnnAssign handling so typed-
  annotation module-level mutables are detected.
- Harness lock-hint matching was case-sensitive (`_LOCK` ≠ `_lock`
  hint). Switched to case-insensitive comparison.

### Deferred

- Microsoft AGT exporter (#267) — still pending schema verification.
- Metis rules 3-5 — still pending defensive-side follow-up paper.

## [0.3.21] - 2026-05-19

**Headline: 1 new INFO rule (203 total) — Stainless-generator
provenance detector anchored to the 2026-05-18 Anthropic acquisition
announcement.**

### Added — Rule (1, provenance / INFO)

- **AAK-MCP-LINEAGE-STAINLESS-001** (INFO) — Two-arm detector for
  Stainless-generated source trees:
  - **Banner arm**: matches `File generated from our OpenAPI spec
    by Stainless.` (verified verbatim against
    github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python on 2026-05-19) or
    `Code generated by Stainless` in `.py` / `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` /
    `.mjs` / `.cjs` / `.go` / `.java` / `.kt` / `.rb` / `.cs` /
    `.php` source files (first 8 lines only; capped at 200 fires
    per scan to bound runtime).
  - **Config arm**: fires on `stainless.yml` / `stainless.yaml` /
    `stainless.config.json` / `.stainless.yml` / `.stainless.yaml`
    at project root, or a `.stainless/` / `stainless/` config
    directory.

  **Provenance, not vulnerability** — severity INFO. Anchor:
  [Anthropic acquires Stainless](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-stainless)
  (2026-05-18). The announcement makes **no** claim of bifurcated
  pre-vs-post-acquisition default-posture, and AAK does not invent
  one. The rule surfaces generator lineage so procurement teams and
  SBOM tooling can answer "which of our MCP servers / SDKs are
  generator-produced." If a future CVE targets a specific Stainless
  version, this rule will be re-targeted.

  New scanner module: `agent_audit_kit/scanners/stainless_lineage.py`.

### Triage closures (no rule shipped)

- **#269 CVE-2026-47090** (MEDIUM, Claude HUD OSC 8 hyperlink
  injection) + **#270 CVE-2026-47092** (HIGH, Claude HUD `COMSPEC`
  command injection) — closed with honest triage: Claude HUD has
  **no public npm/PyPI surface**, so a pin-floor SAST rule has no
  manifest to match against. Runtime architectural shapes ARE
  class-covered (AAK-LOG-INJECTION-001 family for OSC 8 escapes;
  AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001..004 + AAK-STDIO-001 for the env-var-
  controlled subprocess shape). If a published Claude HUD package
  surfaces in the future, a named pin rule lands then.

### Tests

- 6 new tests in `tests/test_v0_3_21_rules.py`: Python banner fires,
  TypeScript banner fires, hand-written source passes, `stainless.yml`
  config fires, empty project passes, banner+config fires both arms.
- Total **974 passing** (was 968 at v0.3.20 baseline, +6).

### Watcher dedup follow-up (v0.3.20 #163 fix)

The watcher dedup fix shipped in v0.3.20 held overnight — the 2
sla-48h tickets that fired today (#269, #270) were **genuinely new
CVE IDs**, not re-fires of yesterday's batch. The 28-ticket daily
re-fire pattern observed 2026-05-13 → 2026-05-18 is structurally
extinct.

### Deferred

- Metis rules 3-5 (closed-loop, self-evolving prompt mutation, etc.)
  — still pending a defensive-side follow-up paper.
- Microsoft AGT exporter (#267) — still pending schema verification
  from `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit` source tree.

## [0.3.20] - 2026-05-18

**Headline: 2 new research-grade rules (202 total) — Metis POMDP
closed-loop reasoning detectors anchored to arXiv:2605.10067 (ICML
2026) — plus the cve-watcher dedup fix (#163) ending 5+ days of
daily ticket re-fires.**

### Fixed — cve-watcher daily-re-fire bug (#163)

The `scripts/cve_watcher.py` `_open_issue_cves` helper only checked
`state=open&labels=cve-response`, so a CVE closed with a class-
coverage citation was forgotten and re-filed on the next watcher
cycle. Renamed to `_all_issue_cves` and changed to `state=all` with
pagination (hard cap at 20 pages = 2000 issues). Back-compat alias
preserved. Regression test in `tests/test_cve_watcher_dedup.py`:
`test_closed_issue_title_suppresses` explicitly asserts a previously-
closed CVE ID is not re-filed.

Impact: ends the 28-ticket daily re-fire pattern observed across
2026-05-13 → 2026-05-18.

### Added — Rules (2, research-grade)

- **AAK-METIS-REFUSAL-REFEED-001** (MEDIUM) — Python AST detector
  for a function that consumes an LLM-refusal signal and either
  returns it or passes it to a prompt-sink call (`format` /
  `append` / `add_message` / `build_prompt` / etc.) without
  policy-mediated transformation. Per Metis (arXiv:2605.10067),
  structured refusal feedback used as a semantic gradient is the
  exploited surface.
- **AAK-METIS-SCORING-SINK-001** (MEDIUM) — same shape applied to
  scoring / judge / reward / critique signals.

**Research-grade tier:** both rules are MEDIUM (not HIGH/CRITICAL)
because the Metis paper is an offensive jailbreak paper, not a
defensive SAST prescription — the proposed rules catch code shapes
the paper shows are exploitable, but don't prove RCE on any specific
tool call. Treat as code-review prompts, not automatic blockers.

New scanner module: `agent_audit_kit/scanners/metis_pomdp.py`.

### Deferred — Suggestion 2 (Microsoft AGT exporter)

The Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit evidence-JSON exporter was
proposed in today's daily prompt. **Declined for v0.3.20** because
the actual evidence-JSON schema is NOT documented in the MS repo's
README — building today would mean guessing the schema. Tracking
issue [#267](https://github.com/sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit/issues/267)
queues the work for v0.3.21+ pending schema verification.

### Deferred — Metis rules 3-5

The 2026-05-18 prompt proposed 5 Metis rules. Three were deferred:
"self-evolving prompt mutation without rate-limit", "structured-
feedback echoing into system prompt", "closed-loop reasoning chain
without circuit-breaker." Each needs more concrete code-shape
specification than the Metis paper itself provides (it's an
offensive paper). Will revisit when a defensive-side follow-up
paper or empirical study lands.

### Tests

- 4 new tests in `tests/test_v0_3_20_rules.py` (Metis: 3 positive,
  1 early-exit-clean).
- 1 new regression test in `tests/test_cve_watcher_dedup.py`
  (`test_closed_issue_title_suppresses` — direct guard against #163).
- Total **968 passing** (was 963 at v0.3.19 baseline, +5).

### Triage (no code change)

- 2 sla-48h tickets closed earlier today (#265 + #266) — class-
  covered re-fires. **These would have been auto-suppressed by the
  v0.3.20 watcher fix** had it shipped yesterday — they were the
  last re-fires before the fix lands.

## [0.3.19] - 2026-05-17

**Headline: 4 new rules (200 total) — source-side generalization of
yesterday's CVE-2026-44717 pin + new MCP-OPENAPI smell category
anchored to Hermes paper (arXiv:2605.14312, EASE 2026).**

Third release today, on top of v0.3.17 (orphan recovery) and v0.3.18
(MCP Calc CVE-2026-44717 pin). This release ships the
complementary source-side detector that v0.3.18's CHANGELOG
explicitly queued.

### Added — Rule 1 of 4: source-side @mcp.tool unsafe eval

- **AAK-MCP-TOOL-UNSAFE-EVAL-001** (CRITICAL) — AST detector that
  fires on any Python function decorated with `@mcp.tool` /
  `@server.tool` / `@app.tool` / `@fastmcp.tool` / `@tool` whose
  body contains an `eval()` / `exec()` / `compile()` / `__import__()`
  / unsafe `parse_expr()` call with an argument bound to the
  function's parameter set. Generalizes v0.3.18's named-product
  pin `AAK-MCPCALC-CVE-2026-44717-PIN-001` to the architectural
  class. New scanner module
  `agent_audit_kit/scanners/mcp_tool_unsafe_eval.py`.

### Added — Rules 2/3/4 of 4: MCP-OPENAPI smell category (Hermes)

- **AAK-MCP-OPENAPI-LAZY-DESCRIPTION-001** (MEDIUM) — operation
  with missing or sub-40-character `description`.
- **AAK-MCP-OPENAPI-BLOATED-PARAMS-001** (LOW) — operation with
  >12 parameters or >24 requestBody properties.
- **AAK-MCP-OPENAPI-TANGLED-METHODS-001** (MEDIUM) — path with >4
  HTTP methods OR method-name vs. path-segment verb contradiction
  (POST /get/..., GET /create/..., etc.).

  Per Hermes (arXiv:2605.14312, EASE 2026 — 2,450 smells across 600
  endpoints) these are the three primary failure shapes that break
  agent tool-selection accuracy when an OpenAPI 3.x spec is
  auto-converted to MCP tools.

  New scanner module `agent_audit_kit/scanners/openapi_smells.py`.
  Auto-detects `openapi.{yaml,yml,json}` / `swagger.{yaml,yml,json}` /
  `*.openapi.*` at project root or in `api/` / `openapi/` / `spec/` /
  `docs/api/` subdirs. Skips files that don't parse as YAML/JSON
  with a top-level `openapi:` or `swagger:` field.

### Declined — Suggestion 2 from 2026-05-17 daily prompt

The proposed `AAK-MCP-067` for CVE-2026-33032 (nginx-ui) is a
verified duplicate. CVE-2026-33032 is already covered by multiple
rules in `agent_audit_kit/rules/builtin.py` including the `AAK-MCPwn-*`
middleware-asymmetry family. The doc's proposed rule also
misdescribes the CVE pattern — NVD says the bypass is an
unauthenticated `/mcp_message` endpoint paired with an authed
`/mcp` endpoint, not 0.0.0.0 binding without auth. Decline.

### Tests

- 7 new tests in `tests/test_v0_3_19_rules.py` — 3 for the eval AST
  detector (positive eval+exec, safe ast.literal_eval, no-decorator
  passes); 4 for OpenAPI smells (smelly fires all 3, clean passes,
  no-spec passes, verb-method-conflict isolation).
- Total **963 passing** (was 956 at v0.3.18 baseline, +7).

### Triage (no code change)

- 2 sla-48h tickets closed earlier today (#262 + #263) — class-
  covered by AAK-OAUTH-* + AAK-SSRF-* family.

### Deferred

- Watcher dedup fix (#163) — v0.3.20.
- PraisonAI CRITICAL pin pair (CVE-2026-41497 + CVE-2026-44336) —
  v0.3.20.

## [0.3.18] - 2026-05-17

**Headline: 1 new CRITICAL rule (196 total) — MCP Calculate Server
pin for CVE-2026-44717 (CVSS 9.8, NVD 2026-05-15).** Ships within
the 48h CVE-to-rule SLA window.

### Added — Rule (1)

- **AAK-MCPCALC-CVE-2026-44717-PIN-001** (CRITICAL, CVE-2026-44717,
  CVSS 9.8) — PyPI `mcp-calculate-server` <0.1.1 routes MCP tool
  input through `eval()` (SymPy-backed, no `local_dict`/`global_dict`
  pinning), reaching host RCE from any attacker-controlled tool
  argument. Pin-arm fires on the package in any Python manifest
  (`requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile*`, `poetry.lock`,
  `uv.lock`). Patched upstream in 0.1.1 (latest at ship: 1.0.0).

### Tests

- 4 new tests (`tests/test_v0_3_18_rules.py`): vulnerable pin fires
  CRITICAL, exact-patched pin passes, floor pin passes, no-dep
  passes.

### Triage (no code change)

- 28 sla-48h tickets closed across 2026-05-16 + 2026-05-17 batches
  (#232–#260) — class-coverage citations against AAK-STDIO-001 +
  AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ family, AAK-OAUTH-*, AAK-SSRF-* family,
  AAK-GHA-IMMUTABLE-001. Watcher dedup (#163) is the underlying
  bug causing the daily re-fire pattern.
- #253 (CVE-2026-44717 itself) closed by ship.

### Process notes

- v0.3.17 (Semantic Kernel CVE-2026-26030) was an orphan release
  from 2026-05-10 — code on `main` since then but the release tag
  was blocked at the CVE-gate by accumulated sla-48h backlog. Tag
  pushed and full release pipeline ran green on 2026-05-17. PyPI
  + GitHub Release + GHCR + Sigstore SBOM all live for both
  v0.3.17 and v0.3.18.

### Deferred

- Source-detector for unsafe-`eval()` inside `@mcp.tool` handlers
  (would generalize the named pin rule to any MCP server with the
  same shape) — v0.3.19 candidate.
- Watcher dedup fix (#163) — v0.3.19. Closed-issue lookup needs to
  participate in the cve-watcher's diff so the same CVE ID doesn't
  re-fire daily.
- PraisonAI CRITICALs (CVE-2026-41497 + CVE-2026-44336) — v0.3.19+.

## [0.3.17] - 2026-05-10

**Headline: 1 new CRITICAL rule (195 total) — Microsoft Semantic Kernel
Python SDK pin-floor for CVE-2026-26030 (CVSS 9.9, MSRC 2026-05-07).**

This release ships within 72 hours of the MSRC disclosure (within
the 48h SLA for the actionable Python arm). The companion .NET CVE
(CVE-2026-25592, file-write in SessionsPythonPlugin) is out of scope
— AAK doesn't currently scan NuGet manifests.

### Added — Rule (1)

- **AAK-SK-INMEMORY-VECTORSTORE-FILTER-CVE-2026-26030-PIN-001**
  (CRITICAL, CVE-2026-26030, CVSS 9.9) — Microsoft Semantic Kernel
  Python SDK <1.39.4 RCE in `InMemoryVectorStore` filter
  functionality. Pin-arm only. Fires on `semantic-kernel` < 1.39.4
  in any Python manifest (`requirements*.txt` / `pyproject.toml` /
  `Pipfile*` / `poetry.lock` / `uv.lock`). Patched upstream in
  `python-1.39.4`.

### Changed

- `CHANGELOG.cves.md` ledger appends MSRC-2026-05-07 row + the
  CVE-2026-26030 entry.

### Tests

- 4 new tests in `tests/test_v0_3_17_rules.py` (vulnerable pin fires
  CRITICAL, exact-patched pin passes, floor pin passes, no-dep
  passes). Total 952 passing (was 948).

### Triage (no code change)

- 8 dup CVE-bot tickets closed (#207, #208, #211–#214 class-coverage
  re-fires; #209 + #210 PraisonAI re-fires deferred to v0.3.18 with
  rule-names already pre-allocated yesterday).

### Deferred

- CVE-2026-25592 (.NET SDK SessionsPythonPlugin file-write,
  patched .NET 1.71.0) — out of scope for AAK's current ecosystem
  (no NuGet scanner). Track for v0.4.x roadmap if NuGet scanning
  ever lands.
- Source detector for unsafe `InMemoryVectorStore(filter=...)`
  shape — v0.3.18 candidate once SK API surface stabilises post-
  patch.
- PraisonAI CRITICALs (#200, #201 from v0.3.16; re-fired as #209,
  #210 today) — `AAK-PRAISONAI-CVE-2026-41497-PIN-001` +
  `AAK-PRAISONAI-CVE-2026-44336-PIN-001` carry to v0.3.18.
- Watcher dedup fix (#163) — v0.3.18.

## [0.3.16] - 2026-05-09

**Headline: 1 new CVE rule (194 total) closing the v0.3.15 triage
deferral on Claude Code folder-trust bypass + GitHub repo
description drift fix + adjudicator-pattern architectural note.**

This release closes the highest-leverage public-marketing-surface
drift the kit has carried since launch (the GitHub repo `description`
field was pinned at "77 rules, 13 scanners" while live RULE_COUNT
was 193) and ships the pre-allocated CLAUDECODE pin rule that v0.3.15
queued.

### Added — Rule (1)

- **AAK-CLAUDECODE-CVE-2026-40068-PIN-001** (HIGH, CVE-2026-40068) —
  Anthropic Claude Code folder-trust bypass via crafted git worktree
  `commondir` file. Pin-arm only (Claude Code is a binary product, not
  a code shape we statically scan); fires on the scoped npm package
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` < 2.1.83 in `package.json` /
  `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Vendor
  patched in 2.1.83 (2026-05-04). Closes the v0.3.15 deferral on
  [#181](https://github.com/sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit/issues/181).

### Added — Architectural note

- `docs/notes/adjudicator-pattern.md` — short write-up of AAK's
  multi-arm adjudicator pattern (pin + source/config + explicit-
  reject short-circuit + adjudicator log), cross-referenced to
  Mozilla's published Firefox-hardening triage flow as an external
  precedent and to arXiv 2605.03378 as the runtime-side complement.
  Closes the procurement-reviewer question "is this a single-shot
  regex scanner or a real adjudicator?" with a one-page answer and
  external citations. README "Why This Exists" appends a one-line
  link to the note.

### Changed

- **GitHub repo `description` field re-PATCHED** from the stale "77
  rules, 13 scanners…" to the live spec sentence: *"Static scanner
  for MCP-connected AI agent pipelines — 193 rules across 11
  categories, 12 compliance frameworks, OWASP Agentic 10/10 + MCP
  10/10, GitHub Action, SARIF, 48h CVE-to-rule SLA."* This was the
  largest single marketing-surface drift on the kit (procurement
  reviewers paste this into their first email) and was not wired
  into `_RULE_COUNT_RE` / sync scripts.
- `docs/RELEASING.md` (NEW) — codifies the release ritual including
  the post-tag `gh repo edit --description` step so v0.3.17+ doesn't
  re-drift. The description-field is a one-time-set field unless
  re-PATCHed every release.
- `CHANGELOG.cves.md` ledger appends a new ANTHROPIC-CLAUDECODE-
  2026-05-06 incident-class header + the CVE-2026-40068 row.

### Tests

- 3 new tests in `tests/test_v0_3_16_rules.py` (vulnerable pin
  fires, safe pin passes, no-dep passes). Total 946 passing
  (was 943).

### Triage (no code change)

- 19 dup CVE-bot tickets closed (#183-#190, #192-#199, #202-#205) —
  class-coverage citations.
- 2 PraisonAI CRITICALs (#200 CVE-2026-41497 CVSS 9.8 + #201
  CVE-2026-44336 CVSS 9.6) closed with **v0.3.17 deferral**:
  rule-names pre-allocated as `AAK-PRAISONAI-CVE-2026-41497-PIN-001`
  + `AAK-PRAISONAI-CVE-2026-44336-PIN-001`. Class detection covers
  CVE-2026-41497 via `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001` but the named pin
  row is missing; CVE-2026-44336 (default-registered file-handling
  tools without sandbox) is a new shape and needs a companion source
  detector.
- #181 closed by ship.

### Deferred

- A3 CSA Agentic Trust full conformance (carry from v0.3.15) — still
  contingent on Anthropic+PE-JV / OpenAI-Deployment-Co procurement-
  spec follow-up. None today.
- Phase 2 row Agent-Zero (#160), Phase 3 LettaAI + transport-flip
  generalization (#161, #162) — v0.3.17+.
- Watcher dedup fix (#163) — v0.3.17.

## [0.3.15] - 2026-05-06

**Headline: Phase 2 of OX MCP 2026-05-01 batch — GPT-Researcher pin
+ transport-flip detector (193 rules total) + new MCP 2026 Roadmap
conformance value for `aak scan --compliance`.**

### Added — Rule (1)

- **AAK-GPTRESEARCHER-MCP-STDIO-MITM-001** (HIGH, CVE-2025-65720) —
  Phase 2 sibling of v0.3.14's DocsGPT rule. Pin arm fires on
  `gpt-researcher` / `gpt-researcher-mcp` in PyPI manifests
  (`requirements*.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `Pipfile*` / `poetry.lock`
  / `uv.lock`), npm (`package.json` + 3 lockfile shapes), and
  `assafelovic/gpt-researcher` git+https / `github:` shorthand pins.
  Latest PyPI release (0.14.8, 2026-03-13) predates the OX
  2026-05-01 disclosure → no upstream patch yet → `patched_in: None`
  posture (every published version fires). Transport-flip arm: new
  `agent_audit_kit/scanners/gpt_researcher_transport_flip.py` mirrors
  the v0.3.14 `docsgpt_transport_flip.py` shape against
  `gpt-researcher`-named MCP configs. Configs with explicit
  `deny_stdio_transport: true` or `allowed_transports: ["sse"]`
  short-circuit the rule. Architectural class is also covered by
  `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001` (Python receiver). Closes [#159](https://github.com/sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit/issues/159).

### Added — Compliance framework (1)

- **MCP 2026 Roadmap** (`--compliance mcp-2026-roadmap`) — 5 controls
  derived from the May 2026 Roadmap publication: Transport Hardening
  (no stdio override), Tool Provenance / Signed Tools, Protocol
  Version Pinning, Authenticated Endpoints (STDIO deprecation),
  Marketplace Source Provenance. Maps onto existing AAK rules via the
  same OWASP Agentic ASI codes the other 5 frameworks use. Bumps the
  README "compliance frameworks" claim from 11 to **12**. Lite scope
  per the 2026-05-06 daily plan; the full CSA Agentic Trust
  conformance surface (deferred yesterday as A3) seeds off this
  data-shape and ships in v0.3.16+.

### Changed

- README "Compliance Frameworks" anchor — increments framework count
  per the `_FRAMEWORK_COUNT_RE` regression pattern.
- `CHANGELOG.cves.md` — appends CVE-2025-65720 row under the
  OX-MCP-2026-05-01 incident-class header that v0.3.14 created.

### Tests

- 8 new tests (`tests/test_v0_3_15_rules.py`): 3 pin-arm cases (PyPI
  vulnerable, git+https vulnerable, no-manifest passes), 3
  transport-flip cases (unsafe fires, explicit-reject passes,
  scope-gate without GPT-Researcher hint passes), 2 compliance
  framework cases (registered + report renders). Total 943 passing
  (was 935).

### Triage closures (no code change)

- 17 duplicate CVE-bot tickets closed (#164–#180) — single-author
  MCP server CVEs class-covered by existing umbrella rules. Watcher
  dedup fix tracked at #163.
- 1 ticket (#181 Claude Code folder-trust via git worktree commondir,
  CVE-2026-40068) closed with explicit v0.3.16 deferral — vendor
  patched in `claude-code` 2.1.83; named pin-floor rule
  `AAK-CLAUDECODE-CVE-2026-40068-PIN-001` queued.

### Deferred

- **A3** (CSA Agentic Trust full conformance surface) — deferred to
  2026-05-07 pending Anthropic+PE-JV / OpenAI-Deployment-Co
  procurement-spec follow-up. The MCP 2026 Roadmap data-shape shipped
  here is the seed.
- **Phase 2 row Agent-Zero (CVE-2026-30624)** — queued for v0.3.16
  per per-rule quality-bar discipline (issue [#160](https://github.com/sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit/issues/160)).
- **Phase 3 row LettaAI** + transport-flip generalization — queued
  for v0.3.16+ (issues [#161](https://github.com/sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit/issues/161), [#162](https://github.com/sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit/issues/162)).

## [0.3.14] - 2026-05-05

**Headline: 1 new CVE rule (192 total) + roadmap doc closing the
2026-05-01 OX/BackBox MCP-server batch — DocsGPT pin (<0.6.4 on
npm/git+https) + DocsGPT MCP-config transport-flip MITM detector.**

This release ships the DocsGPT entry from the OX MCP 2026-05-01
disclosure cluster (CVE-2026-26015 family) as a named product row
alongside the existing class-coverage from v0.3.6's
`AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001..004` + `AAK-STDIO-001`. The other three
products in the carry-list (GPT-Researcher, Agent-Zero, LettaAI)
are queued for v0.3.15 / v0.3.16 per `docs/roadmap/ox-mcp-2026-05-01-batch.md`.

### Added — Rule (1)

- **AAK-DOCSGPT-MCP-STDIO-MITM-001** (HIGH, CVE-2026-26015) — Two
  detector arms. **Pin arm**: fires on `docsgpt` < 0.6.4 in npm
  (`package.json` / `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` /
  `pnpm-lock.yaml`), on `arc53/DocsGPT` git+https / `github:` shorthand
  pins, and on `docsgpt(-mcp)` < 0.6.4 in Python manifests
  (`requirements*.txt` / `pyproject.toml` / `Pipfile*` / `poetry.lock`
  / `uv.lock`). **Transport-flip arm**: new
  `agent_audit_kit/scanners/docsgpt_transport_flip.py` fires when a
  DocsGPT-named MCP config (`.mcp.json` / `mcp.json` /
  `docsgpt.config.json` / `.docsgpt/*.json` / `configs/*.json`)
  declares an SSE/HTTP transport but permits a post-handshake
  `transport=stdio` override. Configs that explicitly set
  `deny_stdio_transport: true` or `allowed_transports: ["sse"]`
  short-circuit the rule. Class architectural shape is also covered
  by `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001..004` + `AAK-STDIO-001`.

### Added — Roadmap

- `docs/roadmap/ox-mcp-2026-05-01-batch.md` — design doc converting
  the OX MCP 2026-05-01 carry-list into 4 named issues with a
  dependency graph (pin → source → fix → test). Sets the v0.3.15 /
  v0.3.16 ramp for GPT-Researcher / Agent-Zero / LettaAI plus a
  cross-cutting transport-flip-resistance generalization.

### Changed

- README "Why This Exists" → appends one-sentence cite of the
  2026-05-01 OX/BackBox 10+-CVE disclosure batch, naming the 9
  affected products and the existing umbrella `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-*`
  rules that catch the receiver-side architectural class.
- `CHANGELOG.cves.md` — appends the OX-MCP-2026-05-01 incident-class
  row + the CVE-2026-26015 DocsGPT row.

### Tests

- 7 new tests (`tests/test_v0_3_14_rules.py`): 3 pin-arm cases (npm
  vulnerable, git+https vulnerable, npm safe-pin passes), 4
  transport-flip cases (unsafe fires, explicit-reject passes,
  no-override passes, scope-gate without DocsGPT hint passes).
  Total 935 passing (was 928).

### Triage closures (no code change)

- 13 duplicate CVE-bot tickets closed (#141–#153) — single-author
  MCP server CVEs already class-covered by
  `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001..004` + `AAK-STDIO-001`. Watcher dedup
  fix re-flagged for v0.3.15.
- 4 tickets closed with v0.3.15 deferral: #154/#155/#156 (n8n MCP
  OAuth open-redirect, CVE-2026-42230/42235/42236 — class-covered
  by `AAK-OAUTH-*` family; named pin-floor for `n8n` <
  1.123.32/2.17.4/2.18.1 queued); #157 (Anthropic Claude TS SDK
  `BetaLocalFilesystemMemoryTool` permissive umask, CVE-2026-41686
  — pin-floor for `@anthropic-ai/sdk` <0.91.1 queued).

## [0.3.13] - 2026-05-03

**Headline: backlog-triage release — 1 new CVE rule (191 total) +
2 new product surfaces (`aak notify` Slack webhook + pre-commit
one-liner installer).** Closes 13 backlog issues in one ship: 8 GFI
trivials (#9, #10, #11, #13, #14, #16, #17, #18, plus #12 already
shipped), the chatgpt-mcp CVE pin (#80), the pre-commit installer
(#65), the Slack webhook (#66 minimum), 4 superseded umbrellas
(#15, #21, #26, #64), and 8 duplicate CVE-bot tickets (#131-#138).

### Added — Rule (1)

- **AAK-CHATGPT-MCP-CVE-2026-7061-PIN-001** (HIGH, CVSS 7.3) —
  `Toowiredd/chatgpt-mcp-server <=0.1.0` OS command injection in
  `src/services/docker.service.ts`. Package isn't on npm — consumers
  install via `git+https://` or `github:Toowiredd/...` shorthand
  in package.json. Pin-check fires whenever the package appears in
  any npm manifest (every published version is vulnerable; no
  upstream patch as of ship date). Architectural class is also
  caught by `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-002`. Closes #80.

### Added — CLI surfaces

- `aak notify [PATH]` — runs a scan and dispatches findings to the
  sinks declared in `.aak-notify.yaml`. Slack `incoming-webhook`
  ships in this release; PagerDuty + Linear are explicit
  `NotImplementedError` stubs so consumers can build configs ahead
  of v0.4.0. Supports `--dry-run` and `--config`. Closes #66.
- `scripts/install-pre-commit.sh` — one-liner installer
  (`curl -fsSL .../install-pre-commit.sh | bash`). Auto-detects
  the latest GitHub Release tag, appends to existing
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or creates a new one, runs
  `pre-commit install`. Closes #65.

### Added — CLI flags / docs / fixtures (#9, #10, #11, #13, #14, #16, #17, #18)

- `aak <subcommand> --version` on every subcommand (21 decorators).
- `aak scan --quiet/-q` suppresses header / summary / tip footer
  on console-format output.
- `aak discover --format json` emits a stable schema for
  programmatic use (`{count, agents}`).
- `aak score` ANSI-colors the grade (A/B green, C yellow, D/F red).
- `.editorconfig` codifies repo conventions.
- `docs/circleci.md` + `docs/azure-pipelines.md` mirror the GH
  Actions integration guide.
- `tests/test_supply_chain.py` — 4 boundary cases for
  `_version_in_range` + the requirements-glob path.

### New module

- `agent_audit_kit/integrations/notify.py` — `SlackSink`,
  `PagerDutySink` (stub), `LinearTicketSink` (stub),
  `load_notify_config`, `run_notify`. Designed so consumers can
  declare every sink they want today; only Slack actually posts.

### Tests

- 14 new tests: 4 chatgpt-mcp pin (`tests/test_v0_3_13_rules.py`),
  10 notify sinks (`tests/test_integrations_notify.py`). Total
  928 passing (was 914).

### Triage closures (no code change)

- `#15` "77 rules" doc — superseded (repo at 191).
- `#21` v0.3.0 tracker umbrella — superseded.
- `#26` v0.3.0 stretch umbrella — half-shipped, items re-filed.
- `#64` Hosted aak.dev SARIF dashboard — wontfix in this repo
  (spin off to `aak-dashboard` if ever pursued).
- `#131-#138` — duplicates of CVEs already class-covered by
  `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001/002/003/004` and triaged in the
  morning v0.3.11/v0.3.12 batch. Watcher dedup follow-up logged.

## [0.3.12] - 2026-05-03

> Note: v0.3.11 was tagged with a stale `pyproject.toml` (still
> reading `0.3.10`) and so the PyPI publish job rejected the
> `0.3.10` wheel as a duplicate; the GitHub Release was skipped.
> The same content ships as v0.3.12 with a corrected manifest. The
> v0.3.11 tag is retained as a permanent failed-release marker;
> it has no PyPI artefact, no GitHub Release, and no `aak`
> consumer should ever see it on the index.

**Headline: 2 new CVE rules (190 total) + README scanner-count drift
fix — astro-mcp-server CVE-2026-7591 SQLi (pin + TS/JS source
detector), LiteLLM CVE-2026-30623 pin floor (auto-fix-wired), and
`scripts/sync_scanner_count.py` to keep README's `<!-- scanner-count
-->` anchor in lockstep with `agent_audit_kit/scanners/`.**

This release closes the public 48-hour CVE-to-rule SLA on two fresh
disclosures: CVE-2026-7591 against TimBroddin/astro-mcp-server (NVD
2026-05-01, no upstream patch released yet — every published version
is vulnerable) and CVE-2026-30623 against BerriAI/litellm (patched in
v1.83.7 on 2026-04-30). It also fixes a long-standing README claim
("28 scanner modules") that drifted past the actual filesystem count
of 57 detectors over twelve minor revs.

### Added — Rules (2)

- **AAK-ASTROMCP-SQLI-CVE-2026-7591-001** (HIGH) — TimBroddin/
  astro-mcp-server SQL injection in `src/index.ts` MCP-tool query
  construction via `request.params.arguments`. Two detector arms:
  pin-check on `package.json` / `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` /
  `pnpm-lock.yaml` fires whenever the package is present (every
  published version <=1.1.1 is vulnerable, no patch as of ship date),
  and a TS/JS source detector fires when files importing the package
  build queries via string concatenation or untagged template
  literals. Tagged-template SQL helpers (`drizzle-orm`,
  `postgres-js`, `sql-template-tag`) escape interpolations safely
  and are intentionally not matched. CVE anchor: NVD 2026-05-01.
- **AAK-LITELLM-CVE-2026-30623-PIN-001** (HIGH, auto-fixable) —
  `litellm` pinned at <1.83.7 in any Python manifest
  (`requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile*`, `poetry.lock`,
  `uv.lock`). Complements `AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001` (which catches
  the source-side architectural shape) by surfacing a discrete
  finding for consumers running pin-check mode. Wired into
  `aak fix --cve` so the auto-fixer rewrites a `requirements*.txt`
  pin in place. Patch anchor: BerriAI/litellm v1.83.7 on 2026-04-30.

### Changed

- README "28 scanner modules" prose → `<!-- scanner-count:total
  -->NN<!-- /scanner-count --> scanner modules` anchor, kept in
  lockstep with the filesystem count via
  `scripts/sync_scanner_count.py`. Same posture as
  `sync_rule_count.py`: pre-commit hook blocks human drift; the
  existing `sync-rule-count.yml` workflow auto-runs
  `sync_scanner_count.py` after relevant pushes and commits the
  bumped files back.
- `agent_audit_kit/__init__.py` — added `SCANNER_COUNT` constant
  alongside `RULE_COUNT`.

### Tests

- 11 new tests: 6 cover the astro-mcp pin + source matrix
  (vulnerable pin fires, concat-source fires, parameterized passes,
  tagged-template passes, no-import-scope-gate passes, pin+source
  side-by-side); 4 cover the LiteLLM pin floor (vulnerable fires,
  safe-pin passes, floor-pin passes, `fix --cve` codemod bumps the
  pin in place); 1 guards the README scanner-count anchor against
  filesystem drift.

### Carry list — for next release

- Four MCP-server CVEs from the 2026-05-01 OX/BackBox roundup
  (DocsGPT, GPT-Researcher, Agent-Zero, LettaAI) need their own
  pin-check + source pattern + fixture sets — deferred from today
  because each is independently >S effort.
- The 2026-05-02 plan's deferred P0 list (Flowise CVE-2025-59528,
  Cursor CVE-2026-26268, OpenClaw CVE-2026-32922 escalation variant,
  LMDeploy CVE-2026-33626) re-evaluates against fresh primary sources
  in the next prompt rather than carrying over silently.

## [0.3.10] - 2026-04-29

**Headline: 8 new rules (188 total), 4 new product surfaces — CrewAI
four-CVE chain (CERT/CC VU#221883), AIVSS v0.8 scoring, LangChain
prompt-loader CVE-2026-34070, Prisma AIRS catalog mapper, OpenClaw
provisional rule, `aak watch-cve` daemon, public coverage page,
`aak rule lint`.**

This release lands the v0.3.10 plan in full: 5 SAST rules + 1 meta
rule for the CrewAI exploit chain, OWASP AIVSS v0.8 scoring during
the public-review window, four new CLI surfaces (`aak score
<sarif> --aivss`, `aak watch-cve`, `aak coverage --source
prisma-airs`, `aak rule lint`), and three open-issue resolutions
(fixture license declarations, parity per-region drift tests, SARIF
runtime-context spec).

### Added — Rules (8)

- **AAK-CREWAI-CHAIN-2026-04-001** (CRITICAL, meta) — fires when all
  four CrewAI 0.x exploit-chain shapes are reachable in one module.
- **AAK-CREWAI-CVE-2026-2275-001** (CRITICAL) — `CodeInterpreterTool(
  unsafe_mode=True)` host-Python sandbox escape.
- **AAK-CREWAI-CVE-2026-2285-001** (HIGH) — `JSONSearchTool` /
  `JSONLoader` path traversal via untrusted file_path.
- **AAK-CREWAI-CVE-2026-2286-001** (HIGH) — `RagTool` /
  `WebsiteSearchTool` SSRF without allow-list / private-net guard.
- **AAK-CREWAI-CVE-2026-2287-001** (HIGH) — `CodeInterpreterTool` no
  Docker liveness gate; silent fallback to host Python.
- **AAK-LANGCHAIN-PROMPT-LOADER-PATH-001** (HIGH) —
  `langchain.prompts.load_prompt(path)` traversal (CVE-2026-34070,
  patched in `langchain-core>=0.3.74`).
- **AAK-PRISMA-AIRS-COVERAGE-001** (INFO, meta) — Prisma AIRS catalog
  coverage manifest.
- **AAK-OPENCLAW-PRIVESC-001** (HIGH, provisional) — OpenClaw
  `OpenClawAgent(role=...)` missing / forgable; IronPlate
  2026-04-07 weekly intel CVSS 9.9.

### Added — CLI commands

- `aak score <sarif> --aivss` — annotate SARIF with AIVSS v0.8
  scores (AARS, environmental, threat, exploit-availability).
- `aak coverage --source prisma-airs` — coverage matrix vs the
  public Prisma AIRS attack catalog. `--fail-under N` for CI.
- `aak watch-cve --feeds ox,cert-cc,thaicert,ironplate` — CVE-feed
  daemon. Polling + dedup + dispatch framework; per-feed fetchers
  land in v0.3.11.
- `aak rule lint --ci` — validate the RuleDefinition registry against
  AAK metadata invariants.

### Added — Runtime helpers

- `agent_audit_kit.scoring.aivss.score_finding(rule_meta, runtime_ctx)`
  + `annotate_sarif(sarif, get_rule)` — AIVSS v0.8 annotator.
- `agent_audit_kit.checks.path_under_root(path, root)` — generic
  path-traversal guard, suppresses
  `AAK-LANGCHAIN-PROMPT-LOADER-PATH-001`.
- `agent_audit_kit.checks.openclaw.assert_role_allowlisted(role,
  allowlist=...)` — suppresses `AAK-OPENCLAW-PRIVESC-001`.
- `agent_audit_kit.sanitizers.crewai`:
  `assert_codeinterp_safe_mode`, `validate_jsonloader_path`,
  `validate_rag_url`, `require_docker_liveness` — suppress the four
  CrewAI sub-rules.

### Added — Manifests & data

- `agent_audit_kit/data/aivss-v08-defaults.json` — per-rule AARS /
  environmental / threat / exploit defaults.
- `agent_audit_kit/data/prisma-airs-catalog.json` + `-aak-map.json`
  — public Prisma AIRS catalog subset + AAK rule mapping.
- `scripts/build_coverage_page.py` + `.github/workflows/coverage-page.yml`
  — nightly public coverage page (HTML + JSON) on gh-pages.

### Housekeeping

- O10 — `tests/fixtures/LICENSES.md` declares derivation + license
  per fixture set.
- O11 — `tests/test_parity_region_drift.py` adds per-region drift
  tests + windowed report (28d / 1s edge cases).
- O12 — `docs/spec/sarif-runtime-context.md` proposes
  `properties.runtime_context` for SARIF.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v0_3_10_rules.py` (10) + `tests/test_v0_3_10_features.py`
  (15) + `tests/test_parity_region_drift.py` (4).

Total suite: 898 passing.


## [0.3.9] - 2026-04-28

**Headline: 5 new rules (180 total), 4 new CLI commands, runtime
parity-drift detector, Pipelock v2.3 policy bridge, and a stdio LSP
adapter that drops AAK findings into Zed and VS Code.**

This release lands the v0.3.9 plan in full: 3× P0 SAST rules for the
2026-04-24/25/26 cluster (Project Deal economic drift, LangGraph
ToolNode regression, DeepSeek V4 MoE tool injection), one P2 rule for
the BlackHat Asia 2026 social-agent hijack class, an OX-disclosed CVE
coverage manifest with a public badge, a Pipelock v2.3 → AAK config
translator, an `aak inspect-ide` CLI that publishes LSP diagnostics
(plus a Zed extension), a runtime `@aak.parity.check` decorator with
`aak parity report`, and corpus-manifest provenance fields
(`source_url` / `license` / `fetched_at`).

### Added — Rules (5)

- **AAK-PROJECT-DEAL-DRIFT-001** (HIGH) — pricing function calls an
  LLM with a templated `model=` and no `@aak.parity.check`. Anthropic
  Project Deal class (LLM09 / economic harm).
- **AAK-LANGGRAPH-TOOLNODE-LIST-REGRESSION-001** (MEDIUM,
  auto-fixable) — `ToolNode([...])` positional list; LangGraph
  prebuilt 1.0.11 silently coerces. Codemod queued via
  `aak suggest --apply-trivial` in v0.4.0.
- **AAK-DEEPSEEK-V4-MOE-TOOL-INJ-001** (HIGH) — DeepSeek V4 MoE-routed
  tool description sourced from a request body / document loader
  without `sanitize_tool_description`. LLM01 with MoE-specific
  surface.
- **AAK-TIKTOK-AGENT-HIJACK-001** (HIGH) — social-agent reply sink
  reachable from user-content source without a human-in-loop gate.
  BlackHat Asia 2026 (Jiacheng Zhong) hijack class (LLM08).
- **AAK-OX-COVERAGE-MANIFEST-001** (INFO, meta) — drives the
  OX-disclosed CVE coverage badge + `aak coverage --source ox`.

### Added — CLI commands (4)

- `aak coverage --source ox` — prints AAK's static coverage of the
  OX disclosure timeline. `--format text|json|badge`.
- `aak pipelock import <policy.yaml>` — translates a Pipelock v2.3
  policy into a `.agent-audit-kit.yml`. `--dry-run` prints to stdout.
- `aak inspect-ide [PATH]` — runs AAK and emits LSP-shape
  diagnostics. `--serve` starts a stdio LSP server (Zed / VS Code
  language clients can attach).
- `aak parity report` — reads the in-process `@aak.parity.check`
  registry and runs the parity assertion. `--window` accepts `7d`,
  `24h`, `60m`, `30s`.

### Added — Runtime helpers

- `agent_audit_kit.parity.check(...)` decorator — records every
  invocation's `(dimensions, metric)` tuple; thread-safe.
- `agent_audit_kit.checks.economic_drift.assert_parity(...)` —
  per-bucket mean drift assertion. `ParityDriftError` on failure.
- `agent_audit_kit.sanitizers.deepseek.sanitize_tool_description` —
  strips control characters + routing-poison tokens, truncates.
  Calling it in the same function suppresses the SAST rule.
- `agent_audit_kit.autofix.langgraph_toolnode.fix(text)` —
  idempotent text-level rewrite for the ToolNode regression.

### Added — Editor / IDE

- `editors/zed/extension.toml` — Zed extension that auto-launches
  `agent-audit-kit inspect-ide --serve`.
- `agent_audit_kit/ide/lsp_diag.py` — minimal stdio LSP server,
  `diagnostics_for(path)` helper.

### Added — Coverage / housekeeping

- `agent_audit_kit/data/ox-cve-manifest.json` — 19 OX-disclosed CVE
  entries, all currently covered.
- `schema/ox-cve-manifest.schema.json` — JSON Schema for the
  manifest.
- `.github/workflows/badge-ox-coverage.yml` — auto-publishes
  `public/badges/ox-coverage.json` when the manifest changes.
- `public/corpora/manifest.json` — bumped `schema_version` to `2`;
  every entry now carries `source_url`, `license`, `fetched_at`.
- `agent_audit_kit/corpus/manifest.py` — `CorpusEntry` carries the
  new provenance fields.

### Tests

- `tests/test_v0_3_9_rules.py` — 14 cases covering the 4 new SAST
  scanners + the autofix codemod (vulnerable + safe + scope-gate).
- `tests/test_v0_3_9_features.py` — 10 cases for parity decorator,
  drift assertion, sanitiser idempotence + truncation.
- `tests/test_v0_3_9_features_p1.py` — 15 cases for OX coverage,
  Pipelock translator, IDE LSP adapter (CLI + library).

Total suite: 869 passing.


## [0.3.8] - 2026-04-27

5 new SAST rules + 5 fixture sets + supporting infrastructure for
Comment-and-Control PR title indirect-prompt-injection, MCP function
hijacking (FHI), Atlassian RCE chain, the wild IPI payload corpus,
and the MCPJam Inspector vendored fork. Released alongside the
critical Dockerfile / engine ignore_paths fix from 0.3.7.


## [0.3.7] - 2026-04-26

**Headline: critical Action / Dockerfile fix — published v0.3.6 was
unwriteable for every consumer; v0.3.7 makes the GitHub Marketplace
listing actually work.**

No new rules. No new scanners. v0.3.7 is a release-mechanics patch:
the Dockerfile fix is load-bearing for any consumer who ran the
Action from Marketplace and hit `Permission denied:
'agent-audit-results.sarif'`. Engine ignore_paths fix lands at the
same time so `--ignore-paths` finally works the way the docs claim.

### Fixed

- **Critical: Docker container ran as `USER scanner`** (UID 999) but
  `/github/workspace` is mounted from the runner's checkout owned by
  the runner UID; the container could not write the SARIF output.
  Every consumer of `sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit@v0.3.70` (and
  earlier) saw `Permission denied: 'agent-audit-results.sarif'`.
  Surfaced via the new dogfood self-scan workflow (PR #71) — the
  loop validates that what we publish actually runs end-to-end.
  Dropped the `USER scanner` directive; container isolation, not
  in-container UID, is the load-bearing security boundary for an
  ephemeral GitHub Docker Action.
- **`engine.run_scan` now applies `--ignore-paths` globally** instead
  of only via the `secret_exposure` scanner kwarg. Every scanner now
  honours the flag. 5 new tests in `tests/test_engine_ignore_paths.py`
  fence the behaviour (subpath match, prefix-not-substring, exact
  file match, trailing-slash insensitivity, multi-scanner suppression).

### Added — release infrastructure

- `.github/workflows/self-scan.yml` — runs the local Action against
  this repo on every push / PR. `default-scan` job (full ruleset,
  `fail-on: critical`) plus `preset-mcp-ox-2026-04` job that
  exercises the `--preset` input end-to-end.

### Upgrade impact

- **Anyone using `sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit@v0.3.70`** should bump
  to `@v0.3.7` immediately. v0.3.6 silently failed to produce SARIF
  output. Workflow YAML is otherwise compatible — no input/output
  changes.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-04-26

**Headline: OX MCP STDIO architectural class — Python/TS/Java/Rust SDK
rules, marketplace-fetch detection, Azure/LMDeploy/Splunk variants,
mcp-ox-2026-04 preset.**

Converts AAK's posture from CVE-by-CVE response to class coverage. 8
CVEs (CVE-2026-30615, 30617, 30623, 22252, 22688, 33224, 40933, 6980)
all trace to `StdioServerParameters(command=<network_input>)` across
the upstream MCP SDKs; v0.3.6 ships one rule per language plus the
marketplace-fetch single-line shape Cloudflare's MCP-defender writeup
called out as the highest-risk bug in the wild.

### Added — rule coverage (8 new rules, 161 → 169)

- **AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-001** (CRITICAL, SUPPLY_CHAIN, Python) —
  `StdioServerParameters(command=...)` from `mcp.client.stdio` /
  `modelcontextprotocol.client` reached via tainted source. AST walk
  with calls sorted by source line.
- **AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-002** (CRITICAL, TypeScript) —
  `new StdioClientTransport({...})` after a fetch / req.body /
  process.env / JSON.parse marker. Regex pass.
- **AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-003** (CRITICAL, Java) —
  `StdioServerParameters.Builder().command(...).args(...).build()`
  after a HttpServletRequest / RestTemplate / WebClient /
  ObjectMapper.readValue / System.getenv marker. Nested-paren-safe
  regex (split into opener + terminator-window scan).
- **AAK-MCP-STDIO-CMD-INJ-004** (CRITICAL, Rust, regex-only) —
  `Command::new(...)` adjacent to mcp_sdk / modelcontextprotocol
  imports after a reqwest / serde_json / std::env / hyper / actix /
  axum body-extractor marker. ~10% FP rate on macro-heavy codebases
  until #22 lands tree-sitter-rust.
- **AAK-MCP-MARKETPLACE-CONFIG-FETCH-001** (CRITICAL, SUPPLY_CHAIN) —
  fetch(URL) → StdioServerParameters in same function. Suppression
  via `.aak-mcp-marketplace-trust.yml` with required justification.
- **AAK-AZURE-MCP-NOAUTH-001** (HIGH, MCP_CONFIG, server-side) — repos
  publishing Azure-MCP-shaped servers without auth middleware on
  `/mcp/*` routes. Sister to v0.3.5's consumer-side AAK-AZURE-MCP-001.
  CVE-2026-32211.
- **AAK-LMDEPLOY-VL-SSRF-001** (HIGH, TRANSPORT_SECURITY) — LMDeploy
  VL image-loader fetches user-controlled URLs without allow-list.
  CVE-2026-33626 (GHSA-only at cut; NVD enrichment pending).
- **AAK-SPLUNK-MCP-TOKEN-LEAK-001** (HIGH, SECRET_EXPOSURE,
  config variant) — splunk-mcp-server config files routing token
  sourcetypes to `_internal` / `_audit` indexes. Distinct from v0.3.4's
  runtime taint detector AAK-SPLUNK-TOKLOG-001.

### Added — preset infrastructure

- `agent_audit_kit/presets/__init__.py` + `load_preset()` registry.
- `agent_audit_kit/presets/mcp-ox-2026-04.yaml` bundles 12 OX-class
  rules.
- CLI flag `--preset <name>` + `preset:` input in `action.yml` +
  positional arg in `entrypoint.sh`.
- Per-preset doc at `docs/presets/mcp-ox-2026-04.md`.

### Caveats

- Rust adapter is regex-only until #22 lands tree-sitter-rust.
- CVE-2026-33626 ships citing GHSA index entry; NVD enrichment
  pending. Pin floor will tighten in v0.3.7.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-04-25

**Headline: LangChain SSRF redirect (CVE-2026-41481), URL-allow-list TOCTOU /
DNS rebinding (CVE-2026-41488), Azure MCP missing-auth (CVE-2026-32211),
toxic-flow source/sink scanner (Snyk Agent Scan parity, feature-flagged),
pre-commit `rev:` pin sync, GitHub verified-creator application packet.**

Closes the watcher-filed 48h SLA on #61 and #62, ships the broader
validate-then-fetch class as two distinct rules (redirect bypass vs. DNS
rebinding TOCTOU), pulls Snyk's toxic-flow scanner into the AAK rule set
behind a feature flag, and removes the README pre-commit `rev:` drift the
v0.3.4 sync workflow missed.

### Added — rule coverage (4 new rules, 157 → 161)

- **AAK-LANGCHAIN-SSRF-REDIR-001** (HIGH, Category.TRANSPORT_SECURITY) —
  validate-then-fetch SSRF: a function calls a known SSRF guard helper
  (`validate_safe_url`, `is_safe_url`, `validateSafeUrl`, …) and then
  fetches via `requests.get` / `httpx.get` / `urllib.urlopen` / `fetch` /
  `axios.get` / `got` without `allow_redirects=False`,
  `follow_redirects=False`, `redirect: 'manual'`, or `maxRedirects: 0`.
  CVE-2026-41481 (langchain-text-splitters < 1.1.2). New scanner
  `scanners/ssrf_redirect.py` walks Python AST (sorted by source line so
  BFS-walk doesn't reorder fetch-before-guard) and applies a regex pass
  for TS/JS sources. Pin-check across `requirements*.txt`,
  `pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `uv.lock`.
- **AAK-SSRF-TOCTOU-001** (MEDIUM, Category.TRANSPORT_SECURITY) —
  validate-then-fetch DNS-rebind / TOCTOU. Same SSRF guard but the rule
  fires on the second-DNS-resolution shape: guard call followed by a
  fetch with no IP-pinning marker (`socket.getaddrinfo`, `HTTPAdapter`,
  `pinned_ip`, `Host:` header pin) in the same function. CVE-2026-41488
  (langchain-openai < 1.1.14). New scanner `scanners/ssrf_toctou.py`.
- **AAK-AZURE-MCP-001** (HIGH, Category.MCP_CONFIG) — Azure MCP server
  consumed without authentication. Detects `.mcp.json` / `.azure-mcp/`
  configs that point at an Azure MCP endpoint without `Authorization:`,
  mTLS client cert, or Azure-AD / managed-identity token. CVE-2026-32211
  (CVSS 9.1, server-side default ships with no auth). Extends
  `scanners/supply_chain.py`.
- **AAK-TOXICFLOW-001** (HIGH, Category.TOOL_POISONING) — Snyk Agent Scan
  parity. Per-scan tool-graph from MCP servers in `.mcp.json` and
  `@tool`/`@mcp.tool`-decorated Python functions. Emits a finding for
  every (sensitive_source, external_sink) pair listed in
  `agent_audit_kit/data/toxic_flow_pairs.yml` unless allow-listed in
  `.aak-toxic-flow-trust.yml` with a non-empty justification. Behind
  `AAK_TOXIC_FLOW=1` feature flag for v0.3.5; full deny-graph design
  review queues for v0.4.0. New scanner `scanners/toxic_flow.py`, data
  file `agent_audit_kit/data/toxic_flow_pairs.yml`.

### Added — release-mechanics / docs

- `scripts/sync_repo_metadata.py` extended with
  `_PRECOMMIT_BLOCK_RE` — rewrites `rev: vX.Y.Z` lines under
  `repo: https://github.com/sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit` only (won't
  touch unrelated pre-commit hooks). New regression test
  `test_pre_commit_rev_pin_matches_version` proves the README pre-commit
  example aligns with `pyproject.toml` on every PR.
- `docs/launch/github-verified-creator-application.md` — pre-filled
  application packet for the GitHub Marketplace verified-creator badge,
  citing PyPI OIDC trusted publishing, Sigstore attestations, SLSA
  provenance v1, Immutable-Action manifest, and the 749-test +
  161-rule signed bundle.

### Fixed

- README pre-commit example pinned at `rev: v0.3.0` while v0.3.4 was
  current — surfaced by browsing main on 2026-04-25. The new
  `_PRECOMMIT_BLOCK_RE` pass and its regression test prevent recurrence.

### Issue closures

- Closes #61 (CVE-response: CVE-2026-41481) — covered by
  AAK-LANGCHAIN-SSRF-REDIR-001.
- Closes #62 (CVE-response: CVE-2026-41488) — covered by
  AAK-SSRF-TOCTOU-001.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-24

**Headline: DNS-rebinding SDK class (CVE-2025-66414/66416, CVE-2026-35568,
CVE-2026-35577), Splunk MCP token-in-log (CVE-2026-20205), GitHub Actions
Immutable-Action / SHA-pin gate, in-flight CVE pin-checks (CVE-2026-40576,
CVE-2026-40608), OWASP Agentic public JSON artefact, repo-metadata sync.**

Closes the April-2026 DNS-rebinding cluster across the Python, Java, TS and
Apollo MCP SDKs, ships a token-in-log sink detector covering the Splunk
MCP bulletin, wires a SHA-pin regression fence for downstream users on the
GitHub Actions 2026 roadmap, and publishes the OWASP Agentic reference-tool
submission packet with a machine-readable coverage artefact.

### Added — rule coverage (6 new rules, 151 → 157)

- **AAK-DNS-REBIND-001** (CRITICAL, Category.TRANSPORT_SECURITY) — MCP
  `StreamableHTTP*` transport exposed without a Host-header allow-list.
  Covers CVE-2025-66414, CVE-2025-66416 (Python `mcp`), CVE-2026-35568
  (Java `io.modelcontextprotocol.sdk:mcp-core`), CVE-2026-35577
  (`@apollo/mcp-server`). New scanner `scanners/dns_rebind.py` walks
  `.py`/`.ts`/`.js`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` sources for `StreamableHTTPSessionManager`,
  `streamable_http`, `StreamableHTTPTransport` and suppresses only when a
  host allow-list marker (`TrustedHostMiddleware`, `allowed_hosts=`,
  `allowedHosts:`, `validate_host`, `HostHeaderFilter`) is reachable
  anywhere in the project.
- **AAK-DNS-REBIND-002** (HIGH, Category.SUPPLY_CHAIN) — vulnerable MCP SDK
  version pinned in a manifest. Patched floors: Python `mcp` ≥ 1.23.0, TS
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ≥ 1.21.1, Java `mcp-core` ≥ 0.11.0,
  `@apollo/mcp-server` ≥ 1.7.0. Scans `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `package.json` (dependencies / devDependencies / peerDependencies),
  `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`.
- **AAK-SPLUNK-TOKLOG-001** (HIGH, Category.SECRET_EXPOSURE) — token-shaped
  values (Bearer, JWT, `splunkd_session`, `st-*`, `sk-ant-*`, `ghp_*`) or
  unredacted token-named variables interpolated into a log sink
  (`logger.info/warn/error`, `print`, `console.log`, `System.out.println`).
  Suppresses on explicit redact markers (`***`, `<redacted>`, `mask(...)`).
  New scanner `scanners/log_token_leak.py`. Pin-check for
  `splunk-mcp-server < 1.0.3` (CVE-2026-20205).
- **AAK-GHA-IMMUTABLE-001** (MEDIUM, Category.SUPPLY_CHAIN) — third-party
  GitHub Action pinned by tag or branch instead of 40-character commit SHA.
  `actions/*` and `github/*` are exempt (Immutable-Actions publishers).
  Local composite actions (`./path/to/action`) are exempt. New scanner
  `scanners/gha_hardening.py` walks `.github/workflows/*.yml` via PyYAML so
  every `uses:` step shape is covered. Aligned to the GitHub Actions 2026
  Security Roadmap.
- **AAK-EXCEL-MCP-001** (CRITICAL, Category.SUPPLY_CHAIN) — CVE-2026-40576,
  `excel-mcp-server <= 0.1.7` path-traversal in `get_excel_path()` combined
  with the default 0.0.0.0 bind on SSE / Streamable-HTTP. Pin-check in
  `scanners/supply_chain.py`. Patched in 0.1.8.
- **AAK-NEXT-AI-DRAW-001** (MEDIUM, Category.TRANSPORT_SECURITY) —
  CVE-2026-40608, `next-ai-draw-io < 0.4.15` body-accumulation OOM in the
  embedded HTTP sidecar. Pin-check in `scanners/transport_limits.py` next
  to AAK-MCPFRAME-001 (same class).

### Added — coverage artefacts

- `public/owasp-agentic-coverage.json` — machine-readable OWASP Agentic
  Top 10 2026 coverage schema (v1) with ASI slot density, CVE references,
  AICM references per rule. Regenerated on every release by
  `scripts/gen_owasp_coverage.py`. `tests/test_owasp_public_json.py`
  enforces the schema and ≥3 rule density floor.
- `docs/launch/owasp-reference-tool-submission.md` — pre-filled submission
  packet for the OWASP Agentic reference-tool registry. Closes #24 + #25.

### Added — release-mechanics / tooling

- `scripts/sync_repo_metadata.py` — single source of truth for
  `sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit@vX.Y.Z` pins across `README.md`,
  `docs/**/*.md` (excluding frozen `release-notes-v*.md` history), and the
  canonical GitHub repo description string. `--check` exits non-zero on
  drift, `--write` rewrites, `--description` prints the string.
- `.github/workflows/sync-repo-metadata.yml` — triggers on
  `release.published` + `workflow_dispatch`; rewrites pins and edits the
  repo description via `gh repo edit`. Uses SHA-pinned actions only.
- `tests/test_repo_metadata_sync.py` — regression fence: every README pin
  must match the live `pyproject.toml` version.

### Fixed

- Closed the cross-category drift where the README badge showed
  "rules-151" while the OpenGraph / repo-description field was stuck at
  "77 rules". The new sync workflow plus regression test remove the class.
- README example snippets now bump in lock-step with the release tag
  instead of requiring a manual edit.

### Deferred to v0.3.5

- CSA MCP Security Baseline v1.0 mapping — not yet public as of 2026-04-24.
  Watcher (`scripts/watch_csa_mcp_baseline.py`) remains armed.
- CVE-2026-31504 (Linux kernel fanout UAF) — out-of-scope for an MCP /
  agent-pipeline scanner. Closed on the CVE-response queue with rationale.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-21

**Headline: mcp-framework + Apache Doris pin-checks, Anthropic MCP SDK
STDIO hardening, CVE-watcher dedup, AICM density to ≥51%, CycloneDX
AI-BOM emitter.**

Clears the 48h SLA on CVE-2026-39313 and CVE-2025-66335, adds the
SDK-level inheritance check the OX Security 2026-04-15 disclosure asked
for, roots out the watcher regression that opened five copies of
CVE-2026-6599, and lifts the AICM mapping density from a 7% starter to
a real procurement-facing 63%.

### Added — rule coverage (3 new rules, 148 → 151)

- **AAK-MCPFRAME-001** (MEDIUM) — CVE-2026-39313, mcp-framework < 0.2.22
  HTTP-body DoS. Detection: `package.json` pin-check + TS/JS regex for
  `readRequestBody`-style chunk-concat accumulating into a string
  without a `Content-Length` / `maxMessageSize` guard. Ships in a new
  `scanners/transport_limits.py`. Strips `//` and `/* ... */` comments
  before matching the size-guard regex so docstring mentions do not
  spuriously suppress.
- **AAK-DORIS-001** (HIGH) — CVE-2025-66335, apache-doris-mcp-server
  < 0.6.1 SQL injection via query-context neutralization bypass.
  Pin-check scans `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `Pipfile(.lock)`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`. Lives in
  `scanners/supply_chain.py`.
- **AAK-ANTHROPIC-SDK-001** (HIGH) — SDK-level STDIO sanitization
  inheritance check covering the OX Security 2026-04-15 class.
  Anthropic declined to CVE — "sanitization is the developer's
  responsibility". Fires only when (a) an upstream MCP SDK is declared
  in a manifest (Python `mcp`/`modelcontextprotocol`, TS
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, Java `io.modelcontextprotocol:*`, Rust
  equivalents), (b) a STDIO transport is exposed, and (c) no
  sanitizer, HTTP opt-out, or documented risk acceptance is present.
  Opt-out via `.agent-audit-kit.yml` with `accepts_stdio_risk: true`
  plus a non-empty `justification:`. Ships in a new
  `scanners/mcp_sdk_hardening.py`. Tagged
  `incident_references=["OX-MCP-2026-04-15"]`.

### Added — OWASP Agentic 2026 density floor

- `tests/test_owasp_agentic_coverage.py` now enforces a **≥3 rules per
  ASI slot** density floor (parametrized). The marketing claim
  "OWASP Agentic Top 10: 10/10" is now backed by a test that fails
  CI if any slot falls below three rules.
- `AAK-A2A-003`, `AAK-A2A-011`, `AAK-A2A-012` gain `ASI08` tags
  (Agent Communication Poisoning) — lifts ASI08 coverage from 1 rule
  to 3.
- `scripts/gen_owasp_coverage.py` additionally rewrites a
  `<!-- owasp-coverage:start -->`…`<!-- owasp-coverage:end -->`
  marker in `README.md` so the rendered coverage table stays in lockstep
  with the code.

### Added — CSA AICM density to ≥51%

- `_AICM_TAGS` in `agent_audit_kit/rules/builtin.py` expands from 10
  rules (7%) to **95 rules (63%)**, covering the SECRET-*, SUPPLY-*,
  TRUST-*, TRANSPORT-*, A2A-*, POISON-*, TAINT-*, SSRF-*, OAUTH-*,
  SKILL-*, MARKETPLACE-*, HOOK-*, and CVE-response families. Each
  family maps to the canonical AICM control domain (DSP / IAM / STA /
  CEK / AIS / LOG / IVS / CCC).
- `tests/test_aicm.py` gets a **density floor assertion** — the suite
  now fails CI if fewer than 75 rules carry an AICM tag.
- `--compliance aicm` CSV output reflects the expanded mapping
  automatically; no CLI change needed.

### Added — CycloneDX AI-BOM emitter

- `agent-audit-kit sbom --format aibom` emits a CycloneDX 1.5 AI/ML-BOM
  on top of the existing SBOM primitive. Adds:
  - `components` entries with `type: "machine-learning-model"` for each
    detected vendor SDK (anthropic/Claude, openai/GPT, cohere/Command).
  - A `formulation` block listing detected agent-platform SDKs
    (LangChain, LangSmith, LangGraph, LangFuse, Helicone, Humanloop,
    MCP SDK) with pURLs where the pin can be extracted.
  - `metadata.properties`: `aak:rule-bundle-sha256` (pulled from
    `rules.json.sha256` if present), `aak:aibom: "1"` marker, and one
    `aak:incident-fired` per fired incident reference so the BOM can
    double as attestation evidence.
- Covered by `tests/test_cyclonedx_aibom.py`.

### Fixed — CVE-response watcher dedup (Task A)

- `scripts/cve_watcher.py` was only deduping against
  `CHANGELOG.cves.md`. A CVE sitting in the SLA queue without a rule
  yet never reached the changelog, so the 6-hourly cron re-opened it.
  Over 48h this filed five copies of CVE-2026-6599 (#47/#48/#50/#52/#55)
  and three of CVE-2025-66335.
- Rewritten with three layers of dedup (any one suppresses):
  1. `CHANGELOG.cves.md`.
  2. Persistent `.aak/cve-watcher-state.json` (cached across workflow
     runs via `actions/cache`).
  3. Open `cve-response` issue titles + bodies via the GitHub REST API.
- New `scripts/close_duplicate_cve_issues.py` groups existing open
  `cve-response` issues by extracted CVE ID, keeps the lowest-numbered,
  closes the rest with a cross-reference body. Ran against live repo
  during this release: closed #48, #50, #51, #52, #54, #55, #56 (7
  dups).
- `.github/workflows/cve-watcher.yml` now wires `GITHUB_TOKEN` +
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` into the diff step and restores the state file
  from `actions/cache`.
- Covered by `tests/test_cve_watcher_dedup.py` — five scenarios
  including the observed "same CVE × 3 cron runs" replay.

### Added — provenance plumbing

- `CHANGELOG.cves.md` gains entries for CVE-2026-39313,
  CVE-2025-66335, and the OX-MCP-2026-04-15 incident class.
- `watch.py` parameter annotations updated from the string-form
  `"callable | None"` to the proper `Callable[[int, list[Any]], None]`
  (incidental mypy-1.x compatibility fix carried over from 0.3.2.1
  hotfix).
- `scanners/marketplace_manifest.py` ships the Python 3.10 `tomli`
  fallback that made CI green for 0.3.2 — kept for 0.3.3.

### Thanks

OX Security for the 2026-04-15 "Mother of all AI supply chains"
disclosure; Apache Doris for the 0.6.1 patch turnaround; the CSA AICM
working group for publishing a v1 control catalog we can map to.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-20

**Headline: MCPwn coverage + third-party OAuth-app surface + OWASP Agentic 2026 coverage proof.**

Closes the KEV-listed CVE-2026-33032 (MCPwn) with a targeted middleware-
asymmetry detector, ships first-class coverage for the April 19 2026
Vercel × Context.ai OAuth breach class, and gates every future PR on
OWASP Agentic Top 10 2026 coverage.

### Added — rule coverage (6 new rules)

- **AAK-MCPWN-001** (CRITICAL) — twin-route middleware-asymmetry
  detector across Go/Gin, Python/FastAPI, and Node/Express. This is
  CVE-2026-33032 itself, not a generic MCP-config check: if `/mcp`
  has AuthRequired() and `/mcp_message` doesn't, the rule fires. Also
  recognises the `router.Group("/", AuthRequired())` patched pattern
  so 2.3.4+ doesn't produce false positives. Maps CVE-2026-33032
  and CVE-2026-27944.
- **AAK-FLOWISE-001** (CRITICAL) — CVE-2026-40933 (GHSA-c9gw-hvqq-f33r,
  CVSS 10.0). Pin-check on `flowise` / `flowise-components` < 3.1.0,
  plus a flow-config pass that flags MCP adapter nodes with
  `customFunction` / `runCode` / `executeCommand` sinks. Auto-fixable
  via `agent-audit-kit fix --cve`.
- **AAK-OAUTH-SCOPE-001** (HIGH) — third-party OAuth client granted
  broad Google Workspace scopes (admin.*, cloud-platform, drive,
  directory.*, gmail.modify/send). Repos add trusted client IDs to
  `.aak-oauth-trust.yml`.
- **AAK-OAUTH-3P-001** (MEDIUM) — repo depends on an agent-platform
  SDK (context-ai, langsmith, helicone, langfuse, humanloop, MCP SDK).
  Informational finding so reviewers audit OAuth-scope footprints
  before merge.
- Together AAK-OAUTH-* tag `incident_references=["VERCEL-2026-04-19"]`,
  the first use of the new incident-provenance field.

### Added — schema + tooling

- **`SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`** bump in `agent_audit_kit/models.py`:
  - New `incident_references: list[str]` field (Task G).
    Backfilled:
    - `AAK-STDIO-001` → `OX-MCP-2026-04-15` (retrofit).
    - `AAK-OAUTH-SCOPE-001` / `AAK-OAUTH-3P-001` → `VERCEL-2026-04-19`.
    - `AAK-MCPWN-001` → `MCPWN-2026-04-16`.
  - New `aicm_references: list[str]` field (Task E) — CSA AI Controls
    Matrix control IDs. Seeded 10 mappings (DSP-17, IAM-01/02/16,
    STA-02/08, CEK-08, LOG-06).
- **`--compliance aicm`** — new scan flag that emits a CSV sorted by
  AICM control ID. `output/aicm.py` is the formatter.
- **OWASP Agentic 2026 coverage gate** — `tests/test_owasp_agentic_coverage.py`
  fails CI if any of ASI01…ASI10 has zero backing rules. Paired with
  `scripts/gen_owasp_coverage.py` that regenerates
  `docs/owasp-agentic-coverage.md` on demand.
- **SARIF `fingerprint-strategy`** — `auto` (default) / `line-hash` /
  `disabled`. `action.yml` exposes the input; `entrypoint.sh` threads
  it. Fixes the GH Code Scanning de-dup regression that marketplace
  runners (detached source) hit without self-emitted fingerprints.
- **CSA MCP Security Baseline watcher** — `scripts/watch_csa_mcp_baseline.py`
  polls the CSA Resource Center + modelcontextprotocol-security.io
  weekly, files a tracking issue on drop, and persists seen versions
  in `.aak/csa-mcp-baseline-state.json` so each version triggers once.
- **`docs/rule-schema.md`** — documents v1 + v2 field set and the
  SARIF tag projection.

### Changed

- Rule count 144 → **148** (6 new rules, 2 of which technically land
  as pairs under the OAuth umbrella).
- `rules.json` regenerated (SHA-256 `5c7b1c47cd067e86a533d6084925472a356442afbefcd8af6f3a0b3c3afd393b`).
- `CHANGELOG.cves.md` now lists the MCPwn + Flowise entries and
  demotes the pre-v0.3.2 "covered by AAK-MCP-011/012/020" claim for
  CVE-2026-33032 to secondary coverage (primary is now AAK-MCPWN-001).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-19

**Headline: Ox MCP supply-chain coverage + rule-count single source of truth + SARIF fingerprints.**

Ships rule coverage for every disclosed MCP CVE from the last 48 hours, honoring
the public [AAK Response SLA](CHANGELOG.cves.md).

### Added — rule coverage (6 new rules)

- **AAK-STDIO-001** (CRITICAL) — Ox Security's Apr-16 disclosure covered
  10 CVEs rooted in the same shape: user-controllable input reaching
  STDIO command executors in MCP servers. One AST-based Python scanner
  plus a TS regex pass closes the whole family in one rule. Maps
  CVE-2026-30615, CVE-2025-65720, CVE-2026-30617, CVE-2026-30618,
  CVE-2026-30623, CVE-2026-30624, CVE-2026-30625, CVE-2026-33224,
  CVE-2026-26015.
- **AAK-WINDSURF-001** (HIGH) — zero-click `.windsurf/mcp.json`
  auto-registration (CVE-2026-30615): flags `auto_approve:true` /
  `auto_execute:true`, world-writable parent dirs, and unpinned server
  commands.
- **AAK-NEO4J-001** (MEDIUM) — `mcp-neo4j-cypher < 0.6.0` read-only
  bypass via APOC (CVE-2026-35402). Version-pin check + source pattern
  detection (`read_only=True` + APOC call in the same file).
  `auto_fixable=True` — `agent-audit-kit fix --cve` bumps the pin.
- **AAK-CLAUDE-WIN-001** (HIGH) — Claude Code Windows ProgramData
  hijack (CVE-2026-35603). Requires sibling `setup.ps1` with `icacls`
  ACL hardening when a `managed-settings.json` lives in a ProgramData
  path.
- **AAK-LOGINJ-001** (MEDIUM) — log injection via CRLF/ANSI in tool
  params (CVE-2026-6494, CWE-117). AST pass: `@tool` parameters flowing
  into `logger.*` / `print` / `sys.stdout` / `console.log` without
  sanitization.
- **AAK-SEC-MD-001** (LOW) — MCP-server repos without SECURITY.md /
  `security_contact`. Anthropic Apr-2026 baseline expectation.

### Added — trust / DevEx

- **Rule-count single source of truth**: `scripts/sync_rule_count.py`
  rewrites the `rules-<N>-blue` badge, the `action.yml` description,
  and `agent_audit_kit.__init__.RULE_COUNT` from `rules.json`. Wired
  into `.github/workflows/sync-rule-count.yml` (auto-commits drift) and
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (blocks human drift locally). Regression
  fence in `tests/test_rule_count_sync.py`.
- **SARIF upgrades** (`output/sarif.py`):
  - `partialFingerprints.primaryLocationLineHash` is now SHA-256 of
    **line content + rule ID**, so GH Code Scanning de-dupes across
    pushes even when line numbers shift, and flags as new when the
    content changes. Falls back to a location-based hash when the
    file can't be read.
  - `helpUri` → `https://agent-audit-kit.dev/rules/{rule_id}` per rule.
  - `results[].properties.security-severity` included on every result
    (was only on the rule descriptor).
- **PR comment + `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`** (`output/pr_summary.py`):
  scan results render as a Markdown table (Rule | Severity | Location |
  Suggestion) written to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` every run, and posted
  as a sticky PR comment (marker-based) when `comment-on-pr=true`.
  New `action.yml` input: `comment-on-pr` (default `true`).
  New CLI flags: `--step-summary` / `--no-step-summary` and
  `--pr-summary-out PATH`.

### Changed

- Rule count 138 → **144**.
- `description:` in `action.yml` now includes the current rule count
  ("144 rules, OWASP Agentic Top 10 + MCP Top 10").
- `rules.json` regenerated and re-signed with the new rule set.

### Fixed

- `README.md` comparison table row claiming "138 rules" for A2A
  scanning (it's always been 12 rules); regression guarded by the
  rule-count sync test.

### Supply chain

Every release artifact continues to ship alongside a Sigstore-signed
`rules.json`, CycloneDX and SPDX SBOMs, and SLSA build provenance on
the Docker image.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

Retroactive SLA coverage for the 2026 MCP CVE wave. See [v0.3.0 release
notes](docs/launch/release-notes-v0.3.0.md) for the full scope — 46 new
rules across the 10 ROADMAP §2.2 families (AAK-MCP-011..020, SSRF,
OAUTH, HOOK-RCE, LANGCHAIN, MARKETPLACE, ROUTINE, A2A-008..012,
TASKS, SKILL). Rule count 77 → 138.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-05

Initial public release.

### Added

- **74 security rules** across 11 scanner categories: MCP configuration, hook injection, trust boundaries, secret exposure, supply chain, agent config, tool poisoning, taint analysis, transport security, A2A protocol, and legal compliance.
- **11 scanners** with full coverage of MCP-connected AI agent pipelines.
- **9 CLI commands**: `scan`, `discover`, `pin`, `verify`, `fix`, `score`, `update`, and CI-mode shortcuts.
- **SARIF 2.1.0** output with GitHub Security tab integration and inline PR annotations.
- **GitHub Action** (`sattyamjjain/agent-audit-kit@v1`) for zero-install CI scanning.
- **Pre-commit hook** for local scanning before every commit.
- **OWASP coverage**: full mapping to OWASP Agentic Top 10 (10/10), OWASP MCP Top 10, and Adversa AI Top 25.
- **Compliance mapping** for EU AI Act, SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and NIST AI RMF via `--compliance` flag.
- **Tool pinning** (`pin` and `verify` commands) to detect rug-pull and supply chain drift.
- **Taint analysis** tracking `@tool` parameter flows to shell, eval, SQL, SSRF, file, and deserialization sinks.
- **Security scoring** with letter grades and embeddable badges via `score` command.
- **Auto-fix** with `fix --dry-run` for safe remediation of common findings.
- **Agent discovery** supporting Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Windsurf, Amazon Q, Gemini CLI, Goose, Continue, Roo Code, and Kiro.
