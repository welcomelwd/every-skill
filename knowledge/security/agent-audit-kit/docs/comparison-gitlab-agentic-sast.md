# AgentAuditKit vs. GitLab Agentic SAST (18.11 GA)

GitLab 18.11 (2026-04-17) shipped Agentic SAST behind the Ultimate
tier. This is a no-marketing, dated-source comparison so AAK
consumers can pick the right tool for their stack.

## Where GitLab is genuinely stronger

- **DAST + IAST integration**: GitLab integrates SAST + DAST + IAST in
  one pipeline. AAK is SAST + supply-chain only.
- **Multi-tenant org-level dashboards**: GitLab's Vulnerability Reports
  aggregate across the org. AAK ships SARIF; consumers wire their own
  dashboard.
- **Ecosystem coverage**: GitLab's traditional SAST has rule packs for
  ~30 languages. AAK targets the agent / MCP slice specifically.

## Where AAK is genuinely stronger

- **Same-day defense for new payload families**: Out-of-band signed
  corpus refresh decouples threat-data updates from product releases.
- **PR-title IPI rule**: First-to-market on Comment-and-Control class
  (CVSS 9.4, 2026-04-25 disclosure).
- **MCP function-hijacking rule**: First-to-market on the BFCL FHI
  class (arXiv 2604.20994, 2026-04-23, 70-100% ASR).
- **Free + OSS**: No tier paywall, no per-seat licensing.
- **SARIF regression gating**: `aak diff` lets PR-blocking workflows
  gate on `newly_introduced` only — eliminates the "huge backlog
  blocks every PR" failure mode that GitLab Ultimate users report.
