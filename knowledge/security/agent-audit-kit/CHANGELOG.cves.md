# AAK CVE-to-Rule Ledger

We triage newly disclosed MCP CVEs continuously and ship rule coverage as fast
as we responsibly can — no fixed public deadline (see `ROADMAP_2026.md §2.3`).
This file is the audit trail of what shipped and when.

Format: one line per CVE, `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN` → `AAK-XXX-NNN` with the
shipped-at timestamp. The GitHub Action `.github/workflows/cve-watcher.yml`
diffs NVD's MCP keyword feed against this file and opens a `cve-response`
issue for anything new; the release gate blocks a tag while any such issue is
open.

> **On the "48h" figures below:** AgentAuditKit does not commit to a 48-hour (or

> The `sla-48h` label is likewise retired and should be removed from any open
> issue. The per-CVE latency figures in the tables are **measurements recorded at

## 2026-08-11 (v0.3.73)

One `cve-response` issue, adjudicated in scope and pinned.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-19516 (Grafana `mcp-grafana` <= 1.0.0 — a caller-controlled `X-Grafana-URL` header sets the outbound destination and `grafana_api_request` picks the method/path/body, so the destination is not restricted to the configured instance, giving SSRF to internal / loopback / metadata endpoints; CRITICAL, CVSS 9.1) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19516) | **Pinned** `AAK-MCP-GRAFANA-CVE-2026-19516-001` (SUPPLY_CHAIN, CRITICAL): `mcp-grafana >= 1.1.0`, which restricts the destination. The incomplete-fix follow-up to CVE-2026-15583 (that fix stopped the service-account token leak but not the destination), so the control is destination restriction, not token handling. mcp-grafana is a Go server but ships a resolvable PyPI wrapper (`uvx mcp-grafana`, versions through 1.1.0), so it is pinnable after all — superseding the 2026-07-16 "documented, not pinned" note. (#566) | 2026-08-11 |

## 2026-08-10 (v0.3.72)

One `cve-response` issue, adjudicated out of scope after a registry check.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-19338 (automateyournetwork `MCPyATS` <= 0.1.4, path traversal via `folder`/`name` in `mcp_servers/mermaid/index.ts`; local) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19338) | **Out of scope, unpinnable.** `mcpyats`, `@automateyournetwork/mcpyats`, and `pyats-mcp` all 404 on npm, and `mcpyats` 404 on PyPI. A GitHub-only project with no versioned registry artifact to pin. (#565) | 2026-08-10 |

## 2026-08-09 (v0.3.71)

Three `cve-response` issues filed the same day (all MEDIUM CVSS 5.3), adjudicated on
their merits against the npm registry rather than by repeating the prior batch's
disposition. One is in scope and shipped a pin; two are unpinnable. Each was read from
NVD and verified against the registry before deciding.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-19337 (adenot `@adenot/mcp-google-search` <= 0.3.1, SSRF via the `url` argument of `read_webpage` in `src/index.ts`; local) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19337) | **In scope.** Added `AAK-MCP-GOOGLESEARCH-CVE-2026-19337-001` (SUPPLY_CHAIN, MEDIUM). The scoped npm package resolves on the registry (versions 0.1.0 through 0.3.1); the unscoped `mcp-google-search` is a different package and is not pinned. No fixed release exists yet (upstream patch `f071d491` unreleased), so the pin is presence-only and fires on any installed version, with remediation to remove or replace until a patched version ships. Same shape as the astrbot MCP-test-endpoint SSRF pin. (#558) | 2026-08-09 |
| CVE-2026-19329 (andreahaku `codex_mcp`, command injection via `model` in `src/codex-process-simple.ts`; local) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19329) | **Out of scope, unpinnable.** `codex_mcp` and `@andreahaku/codex-mcp` both 404 on npm; the advisory states the project does not use versioning (git-hash artifact only). The only `codex-mcp` on npm is an unrelated author's package, so a name pin would false-positive it. No fix floor and no resolvable artifact to pin. (#556) | 2026-08-09 |
| CVE-2026-19332 (NellyW8 `MCP4EDA` 1.0.0, command injection via `design_name`/`vcd_file` in `run_openlane`/`view_waveform`; local) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19332) | **Out of scope, unpinnable.** `mcp4eda` and `@nellyw8/mcp4eda` both 404 on npm; a GitHub-only project with no registry artifact to pin. (#557) | 2026-08-09 |

## 2026-08-08 (later batch, unreleased)

Four more `cve-response` issues filed the same day, all adjudicated **out of scope**:
each is a rolling-release or unpatched GitHub project with **no fixed version** to pin to
(fix PRs unaccepted or maintainers unresponsive), and three of the four are local-only.
A version pin needs a fix floor to tell users what to upgrade to; there is none here, so
there is nothing for the pin scanner to key on. Each was read from NVD, not the title.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-19263 (INQUIRELAB `mcp-bridge-api` — command injection via `command`/`args` in `mcp-bridge.js`; remote; HIGH CVSS 7.3) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19263) | **Out of scope** — rolling release with no version details for affected or fixed releases, and the fix PR "awaits acceptance", so there is no fix floor to pin. Not distributed under a resolvable pinnable name. Same basis as the ssh-mcp-server / MissionSquad dispositions. (#551) | 2026-08-08 |
| CVE-2026-19268 (abdullah1854 `MCPGateway` — command injection via the `since` arg in `claude-usage.ts`; remote, exploit public; MEDIUM CVSS 6.3) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19268) | **Out of scope** — rolling release, "no version details of affected nor updated releases", maintainer unresponsive; a GitHub project with no fixed version to pin. (#552) | 2026-08-08 |
| CVE-2026-19270 (Hulupeep `mcp-ui-probe` ≤ 0.2.0 — path traversal via `journeyId`/`filename` in `JourneyStorage.ts`; local; MEDIUM CVSS 5.3) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19270) | **Out of scope** — the project was informed but has not responded and has shipped no fix, so there is no fix floor to upgrade to; local-only attack. (#553) | 2026-08-08 |
| CVE-2026-19279 (MIMICLab `mcp-pdf-vision` 1.1.0 — command injection via `pdfPath`/`sessionId` in `src/index.ts`; local; MEDIUM CVSS 5.3) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19279) | **Out of scope** — informed but unpatched (no fixed version to pin), and the attack is local-only. (#554) | 2026-08-08 |

## 2026-08-08 (unreleased)

Three `cve-response` issues filed after the 2026-08-06 batch, adjudicated for the same
(still-unreleased) cut: two new PyPI pins and one out of scope. Each row quotes a
verbatim excerpt of the NVD description; each was read from NVD, not the issue title.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-48039 (`meta-ads-mcp` < 1.0.109 — `AuthInjectionMiddleware` forwards unauthenticated requests without a 401, and a failed Graph API call serialises the request URL, including the `access_token`, into the response → unauthenticated tool invocation + credential leak; CRITICAL CVSS 9.1) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-48039) | **Pinned** `AAK-METAADS-CVE-2026-48039-001` — fix floor 1.0.109. A pinnable PyPI artifact (latest 1.0.119) the pin scanner resolves from `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`/`.mcp.json`. Tests `test_metaads_below_floor_fires` / `test_metaads_patched_passes`. NVD verbatim: *"AuthInjectionMiddleware.dispatch() at http_auth_integration.py:272 unconditionally forwards unauthenticated Streamable HTTP requests to downstream MCP tool handlers without issuing a 401 response ... when the downstream Meta Graph API call fails, api.py:263-269 serialises the raw httpx request URL—including the operator's access_token as a query parameter—into the JSON-RPC response body, delivering the credential to the unauthenticated caller."* (#549) | 2026-08-08 |
| CVE-2026-71433 (`langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` / `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite` < 3.1.1 — namespaces stored as a dot-joined string and read by simple prefix match, so a scoped read spills into a sibling namespace → cross-tenant checkpoint leak; MEDIUM CVSS 5.3) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-71433) | **Pinned** `AAK-MCP-LANGGRAPH-CHECKPOINT-CVE-2026-71433-001` — fix floor 3.1.1, matching either PyPI name; the Postgres/SQLite sibling of the langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb leak (CVE-2026-48121). Tests `test_langgraph_checkpoint_postgres_below_floor_fires` / `_sqlite_below_floor_fires` / `_patched_passes`. NVD verbatim: *"persisted hierarchical namespaces as a dot joined string and scoped reads by matching that string as a simple prefix pattern, so a read scoped to one namespace could also match a sibling namespace ... allowing an authenticated caller to retrieve stored items belonging to another tenant or user through an ordinary scoped search or list namespaces call, with no crafted input required."* (#548) | 2026-08-08 |
| CVE-2026-19244 (HKUDS `nanobot` ≤ 0.2.1 — MCP resource/prompt wrappers registered outside the intended `enabledTools` scope → improper access control; MEDIUM CVSS 4.7) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19244) | **Out of scope** — the affected project is HKUDS `nanobot` (a GitHub-hosted MCP agent framework; upgrade to 0.3.0), but the PyPI `nanobot` is an unrelated "minimalist robot navigation framework" with no 0.2.1/0.3.0 releases, so there is no distributable the version-pin scanner can match under a resolvable name. Same basis as the MissionSquad mcp-api dispositions. NVD verbatim: *"MCP resource and prompt wrappers could be registered outside the intended enabledTools scope. The registration boundary was corrected."* (#550) | 2026-08-08 |

## 2026-08-06 (unreleased)

Eleven `cve-response` issues adjudicated: two new pins (`awslabs.documentdb-mcp-server`
and `frontmcp`, both verified as real distributables), six folded into existing pins
(five Langflow CVEs into the `langflow` pin whose 1.11.0 floor already exceeds every
affected version, and one PraisonAI CVE into the `praisonai` pin whose 4.6.78 floor
already exceeds its 4.6.40 fix), and three out of scope. Each row quotes a verbatim
excerpt of the NVD description; each was read from NVD, not the issue title.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-18954 (`awslabs.documentdb-mcp-server` < 1.0.12 — write-capable aggregation-pipeline stages bypass read-only-mode enforcement → unauthorized writes; MEDIUM CVSS 5.5) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-18954) | **Pinned** `AAK-MCP-DOCUMENTDB-CVE-2026-18954-001` — fix floor 1.0.12; the fifth pin in the `awslabs.*-mcp-server` family. A pinnable PyPI artifact (latest 1.0.14) the pin scanner resolves from `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`/`.mcp.json`. Tests `test_documentdb_below_floor_fires` / `test_documentdb_patched_passes`. NVD verbatim: *"Incorrect authorization in the aggregation pipeline tool in Amazon AWS Labs DocumentDB MCP Server before 1.0.12 might allow an authenticated MCP client to perform inappropriate write operations on the connected database via write-capable aggregation pipeline stages that bypass the read-only mode enforcement logic."* (#543) | 2026-08-06 |
| CVE-2026-67531 (`frontmcp` < 1.5.7 — the sandboxed `codecall:execute` tool reaches the host Zod schema's Function constructor and runs arbitrary code as the server user; unauthenticated in the default public auth mode; NVD CVSS n/a) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-67531) | **Pinned** `AAK-MCP-FRONTMCP-CVE-2026-67531-001` — fix floor 1.5.7. A pinnable npm artifact (latest 1.6.0) the pin scanner resolves from `package.json`/lockfiles/`.mcp.json`. Tests `test_frontmcp_below_floor_fires` / `test_frontmcp_patched_passes`. NVD verbatim: *"the sandboxed codecall:execute tool exposes live host Zod schema instances to the script via getTool(), and because Zod v4 defines _zod as a non-configurable, non-writable own property, the ECMAScript Proxy invariants force the security membrane to hand back the raw host object, letting a script reach _zod.constr.constructor (the host Function constructor) and execute arbitrary code in the server process."* (#544) | 2026-08-06 |

Thematically adjacent to this release's `.vscode/tasks.json` work (writing to IDE config) but the vulnerable component is `langflow` itself, remediated by the version pin. NVD verbatim: *"allows remote authenticated attackers to bypass localhost-only restrictions and write arbitrary MCP server configurations to IDE configuration files on the host system."* (#541) | 2026-08-06 |
| CVE-2026-7646 (IBM Langflow OSS 1.0.0–1.10.3 — `resources/read` path traversal reads the JWT secret, SQLite DB, and process env; MEDIUM 6.5) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-7646) | **Class-covered** by the `langflow` pin (floor 1.11.0 > 1.10.3); CVE added to `cve_references`.

Not resolvable from a client manifest. NVD verbatim: *"The intended threat model is that this MCP server is a local/trusted tool for an agent to execute commands over SSH, so callers already have meaningful execution capability through the exposed shell."* (#545) | 2026-08-06 |

No pinnable artifact. Same basis as prior GitHub-release-only dispositions. Upgrade to 1.11.10. (#546) | 2026-08-06 |
| CVE-2026-19041 (MissionSquad `mcp-api` ≤ 1.11.8 — command injection in the NPM package version handler `installPackage`; MEDIUM CVSS 6.3) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-19041) | **Out of scope** — same MissionSquad `mcp-api` GitHub project (patch commit `a40f54d`); not distributed on npm/PyPI under a resolvable name, so nothing for the version-pin scanner to match. Upgrade to 1.11.9. (#547) | 2026-08-06 |

## 2026-08-05 (unreleased)

Three `cve-response` issues adjudicated: one new pin (`@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb`,
an npm artifact), and two Flowise CVEs folded into the existing `AAK-FLOWISE-001`
rule whose floor was already 3.1.3 — no new rule and no floor change for those two.

Two `cve-response` issues adjudicated: one pinned (fourth `awslabs.*-mcp-server`

Two `cve-response` issues adjudicated for the v0.3.67 cut — both the same upstream
(ArcadeDB < 26.7.3, vendor ArcadeData), both out of scope. No new rule. Each was
verified against the NVD record (not the issue title) before a verdict.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-68578 (ArcadeDB < 26.7.3 — the MCP HTTP transport fails to bind the authenticated principal, so all engine permission checks silently pass as no-ops → authorization bypass; HIGH 7.5) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-68578) | **Out of scope** — ArcadeDB is a Java multi-model database distributed as a JAR / Docker image, not a PyPI/npm artifact the pin detector reads (no Maven/Gradle/`go.mod` in its candidate set), and the auth-principal-binding failure is a server-side runtime property with no config-detectable signature. Same basis as SiYuan CVE-2026-66012 (#499). Upgrade to ≥ 26.7.3; the reachable exposed / unauthenticated remote MCP endpoint posture is flagged by `AAK-MCP-001`. (#528) | 2026-08-03 |
| CVE-2026-67357 (ArcadeDB < 26.7.3 — the MCP `get_server_settings` tool leaks `arcadedb.ha.clusterToken` in cleartext → information disclosure; HIGH 7.5) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-67357) | **Out of scope** — same Java/Docker ecosystem the pin detector does not read, and a server-side information disclosure through an MCP tool response, not a version pinned in a client config. Upgrade to ≥ 26.7.3. (#527) | 2026-08-03 |

## 2026-08-02 (v0.3.66)

Three `cve-response` issues adjudicated for the v0.3.66 cut — one out of scope, and
two `better-auth` CVEs folded into the existing `better-auth` pin (its floor raised
1.6.11 → 1.6.13). No new rule. Each was verified against the NVD record (not the
issue title) before a verdict.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-15988 (AI Engine – The Chatbot, AI Framework & MCP for WordPress plugin ≤ 3.6.5 — CSRF via missing/incorrect nonce validation on `reauth_for_authorize`; HIGH 8.8) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-15988) | **Out of scope** — a WordPress/PHP plugin, an ecosystem the pin detector does not read (no PyPI/npm artifact, no version in a client `.mcp.json`/manifest), and a server-side CSRF on a web endpoint with no config-detectable signature. Same basis as the prior WordPress-plugin dispositions (CVE-2026-15015 #490, CVE-2026-9810). Upgrade the plugin to ≥ 3.6.6. (#523) | 2026-08-02 |
| CVE-2026-67333 (`better-auth` < 1.6.13 — the deprecated `oidc-provider` and `mcp` plugins do not validate the scheme of registered `redirect_uris`, so a `javascript:` redirect URI executes in the authorization-server origin → session theft / account takeover; HIGH 7.2 / CVSS 4.0 5.1) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-67333) | **Pinned** — folded into the existing `AAK-MCP-BETTERAUTH-CVE-2026-53512-001` pin, whose floor is **raised 1.6.11 → 1.6.13** (1.6.11/1.6.12 fixed the earlier flaws but are still exposed to this one) and CVE added to `cve_references`; regression test `test_betterauth_1612_fires_for_67333`. The 1.7.0-beta.0–beta.3 pre-release gap (fixed 1.7.0-beta.4) is outside the stable version-tuple pin's scope. (#524) | 2026-08-02 |
| CVE-2026-67336 (`better-auth` < 1.6.11 — insecure cryptographic defaults in the `oidcProvider` and `mcp` plugins advertise the `none` algorithm and accept plain PKCE by default; CRITICAL CVSS 4.0 9.4 / HIGH 8.7) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-67336) | **Class-covered** by the existing `AAK-MCP-BETTERAUTH-CVE-2026-53512-001` pin — fixed 1.6.11, already ⊆ the raised 1.6.13 floor; CVE added to the rule's `cve_references`. No separate rule. (#525) | 2026-08-02 |

## 2026-08-01 (v0.3.65)

One `cve-response` issue adjudicated for the v0.3.65 cut — filed by the NVD watcher
while the release was being tagged, and pinned (not deferred) so the release gate
stayed honest. Verified against the NVD record before a verdict.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-54785 (gemini-bridge `1.0.0`–`1.3.0` — `consult_gemini_with_files` inline mode reads any file path in the `files` argument without confining it to the working directory, then forwards the contents to the Gemini CLI → path-traversal file exfiltration; MEDIUM 6.2) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-54785) | **Pinned** `AAK-MCP-GEMINIBRIDGE-CVE-2026-54785-001` — fix floor `gemini-bridge` 1.3.1, `introduced` 1.0.0. The PyPI `gemini-bridge` (versions 1.0.0–1.3.1) is the artifact the CVE range matches and is resolvable from `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`; the npm `gemini-bridge` (0.1.x) is an unrelated package below the affected range. (#519) | 2026-08-01 |

## 2026-07-31 (v0.3.64)

Six `cve-response` issues adjudicated for the v0.3.64 cut — one new pin
(`langflow`, a PyPI artifact) and five dispositioned out of scope. The five disposed
CVEs are one upstream: Google `mcp-toolbox` (`googleapis/genai-toolbox`), a **Go
binary** the client-config / dependency-manifest pin scanner does not read (its
candidate set is PyPI/npm manifests, lockfiles, and MCP config files; no `go.mod`),
plus server-side runtime flaws invisible to a static client scan — the same basis on
which CVE-2026-15829 (also `mcp-toolbox`) was dispositioned. Each CVE was verified
against the NVD record (not the issue title) before a verdict.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-12940 (IBM Langflow OSS `langflow` 1.0.0–1.10.1 — the MCP stdio launcher's `DANGEROUS_ENV_VARS` blocklist (`src/lfx/base/mcp/util.py`) omits `SHELLOPTS`/`BASHOPTS`/`PS4` → unauthenticated env-var-injection RCE; CRITICAL 9.8) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-12940) · GHSA-gx45-8jc3-gqqr | **Pinned** `AAK-MCP-LANGFLOW-CVE-2026-12940-001` — fix floor `langflow` 1.11.0, `introduced` 1.0.0 (1.11.0 is the first PyPI release after the affected 1.10.1; there is no 1.10.2, and pre-1.0.0 predates the MCP stdio launcher).

The reachable posture — an exposed MCP HTTP endpoint — is flagged by `AAK-MCP-001`. Upgrade past the affected releases. (#514) | 2026-07-31 |
| CVE-2026-14538 (Google `mcp-toolbox` 0.16.1–1.4.0 — a fail-open logic error in the `bigquery-execute-sql` dry-run enforcement lets an authenticated user bypass `allowedDatasets` validation and read excluded/federated schemas; MEDIUM CVSS 4.0 5.7) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-14538) | **Out of scope** — Go binary (`googleapis/genai-toolbox`), not pinnable, and a server-side data-authorization bug invisible to a static client-config scan. Upgrade past the affected range. (#515) | 2026-07-31 |
| CVE-2026-14539 (Google `mcp-toolbox` ≤ 1.4.0 — the `/mcp` HTTP handler reads request bodies into memory with no size limit → unauthenticated memory-exhaustion DoS; MEDIUM CVSS 4.0 6.6) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-14539) | **Out of scope** — Go binary, not pinnable (no `go.mod` surface), and a transport-internal resource-exhaustion DoS with no client-config signal. Reachable posture at most is the exposed endpoint (`AAK-MCP-001`). Upgrade past 1.4.0. (#516) | 2026-07-31 |
| CVE-2026-14540 (Google `mcp-toolbox` 0.3.0–1.4.0 — the generic HTTP source/tool client lacks redirect validation and private-IP checks → SSRF via open redirect; HIGH CVSS 4.0 8.0) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-14540) | **Out of scope** — Go binary (`googleapis/genai-toolbox`), not pinnable. The caller-URL→fetch-without-allow-list SSRF class is what `AAK-MCP-SSRF-001` covers on AAK's client-scan side. Upgrade past the affected range. (#517) | 2026-07-31 |
| CVE-2026-14541 (Google `mcp-toolbox` 1.4.0 — the Google OAuth provider skips audience validation for opaque tokens when `mcpEnabled: true` but no audience/clientId is configured → auth bypass / audience confusion; HIGH CVSS 4.0 8.0) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-14541) | **Out of scope** — Go binary, not pinnable, and a server-side OAuth-validation flaw. The audience-confusion / missing-resource-binding class is `AAK-OAUTH-007`'s territory (RFC 8707 resource indicators) on the client side. Upgrade past 1.4.0. (#518) | 2026-07-31 |

## 2026-07-30 (v0.3.63)

Six `cve-response` issues adjudicated for the v0.3.63 cut — one new pin
(`flyto-core`, a PyPI artifact) and five dispositioned out of scope. The five
disposed CVEs are one upstream: the official MCP Ruby SDK (`mcp` gem, vendor
`modelcontextprotocol`) before 0.23.0 — a RubyGems ecosystem the client-config /
dependency-manifest pin scanner does not read (its candidate set is PyPI/npm
manifests, lockfiles, and MCP config files; no `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock`), plus
server-side transport internals invisible to a static client scan. Their shared
remediation: upgrade the `mcp` gem to ≥ 0.23.0. Each CVE was verified against the
NVD record (not the issue title) before a verdict.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVE-2026-67425 (Flyto2 Core `flyto-core` < 2.26.6 — `llm.chat` reads provider keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) from the environment and forwards them in the `Authorization: Bearer` header to a caller-controlled `base_url` that clears the SSRF guard → operator provider-key exfiltration; HIGH 8.6) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-67425) | **Pinned** `AAK-MCP-FLYTO-CVE-2026-67425-001` — fix floor `flyto-core` 2.26.6 (all prior versions affected; no `introduced` bound). `flyto-core` is a pinnable PyPI artifact the pin scanner resolves from `pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`/`uv.lock` (same basis as the `awslabs.aws-api-mcp-server` PyPI pin). The env-var-key exfil-to-caller-controlled-`base_url` class is adjacent to the config-side env-secret exfil surface `AAK-MCP-ENV-PLACEHOLDER-EXFIL-001` (`tests/test_mcp_env_placeholder_exfil.py`). (#507) | 2026-07-30 |
| CVE-2026-67432 (MCP Ruby SDK / `mcp` gem < 0.23.0 — `StreamableHTTPTransport` parses an unbounded JSON-RPC POST body → unauthenticated remote memory-exhaustion DoS; HIGH 7.5) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-67432) | **Out of scope** — RubyGems artifact + server-side transport-internal resource exhaustion; a gem version is invisible to the pin scanner (no `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock` in its candidate set) and an unbounded-body DoS leaves no client-config signal. Upgrade the `mcp` gem to ≥ 0.23.0; the reachable posture at most is the exposed remote endpoint (`AAK-MCP-001`). (#512) | 2026-07-30 |
| CVE-2026-67431 (MCP Ruby SDK / `mcp` gem < 0.23.0 — `StreamableHTTPTransport` does not bind a session ID to a session owner → an attacker with a stolen session ID runs `tools/call` in the victim's session; HIGH CVSS 4.0 8.3) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-67431) | **Out of scope** — RubyGems + server-side session-authorization internals, invisible to a static client-config/manifest scan (no `Gemfile` in the pin surface). Upgrade to ≥ 0.23.0. The reachable posture — an unauthenticated/hijackable remote MCP endpoint — is flagged by `AAK-MCP-001`. (#511) | 2026-07-30 |
| CVE-2026-63118 (MCP Ruby SDK / `mcp` gem < 0.23.0 — `StreamableHTTPTransport` does not validate the HTTP `Host`/`Origin` headers → a malicious browser page uses DNS rebinding to reach a locally running MCP server and invoke tools; MEDIUM CVSS 4.0 6.9) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-63118) | **Out of scope** — RubyGems + server-side transport internals not visible to a static client scan (no `Gemfile` in the pin surface). Upgrade to ≥ 0.23.0. The DNS-rebinding / missing-`Host`-validation class is covered on AAK's side by the transport-security rule `AAK-DNS-REBIND-001` (browser DNS-rebind → loopback MCP server).

Upgrade to ≥ 0.23.0. Reachable posture at most is the exposed remote endpoint (`AAK-MCP-001`). (#510) | 2026-07-30 |
| CVE-2026-63119 (MCP Ruby SDK / `mcp` gem < 0.23.0 — `StdioTransport` / `Client::Stdio` use `IO#gets` with no byte limit → a peer sending data without a newline exhausts process memory; MEDIUM 6.2) | [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-63119) | **Out of scope** — RubyGems + a local stdio-transport resource exhaustion in the gem's Ruby source; not visible in any client config and no `Gemfile` in the pin surface. Being a local stdio DoS, the remote-endpoint `AAK-MCP-001` posture does not apply. Upgrade to ≥ 0.23.0. (#509) | 2026-07-30 |

## 2026-07-28 (v0.3.62)

Three `cve-response` issues adjudicated for the v0.3.62 cut — all dispositioned
out of scope with rationale (no new rule). Each was verified against the NVD
record (not the issue title) before a verdict.

| CVE | Reference | AAK rule / disposition | Triaged |

Bind to loopback + require auth; the no-auth-remote-endpoint class is flagged by `AAK-MCP-001`. (#503) | 2026-07-28 |

## 2026-07-27 (v0.3.60)

Seven `cve-response` issues adjudicated for the v0.3.60 cut — one new pin, one
class-covered by an existing pin, five dispositioned out of scope with rationale.
Each was verified against the NVD record (not the issue title) before a verdict.
