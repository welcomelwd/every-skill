# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Codex Security. We welcome bug reports, feature
requests, documentation corrections, and feedback from open-source
maintainers.

## How this repository works

Codex Security is developed in OpenAI's canonical repository and published
here through a one-way mirror. We can't import pull requests from this
repository into the canonical source.

Search [existing issues](https://github.com/openai/codex-security/issues)
before opening a new one. Maintainers can carry accepted changes into the
canonical source or invite a focused pull request for this public repository.

## Support for open-source projects

If you maintain an open-source project,
[open an issue](https://github.com/openai/codex-security/issues/new) with the
repository, your role, and what you need. Support is best effort. Scan only
repositories you trust and either own or have permission to assess.

## Report a bug

Include your CLI or SDK version, operating system, reproduction steps, and
the expected and observed behavior. Remove credentials, private code,
customer data, and security findings before posting.

## Suggest a feature or improve the documentation

Open an issue describing the problem and the workflow you want to support.
Documentation corrections and safe examples are welcome.

## Report a security issue

Report Codex Security vulnerabilities privately as described in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Do not post vulnerabilities, exploit details,
credentials, or sensitive scan results publicly.

If a scan finds a vulnerability in another project, report it to that
project's maintainers through their security policy.

## Dependency and release maintenance

Maintainers update package dependencies and the committed lockfile in the
canonical repository. The public release workflow installs that locked graph,
tests the package, and publishes a verified artifact with npm provenance.
GitHub Actions dependencies are maintained separately in this repository.
