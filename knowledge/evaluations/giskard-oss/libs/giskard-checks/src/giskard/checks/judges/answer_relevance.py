    BaseLLMCheck[InputType, OutputType, TraceType]
):
    """LLM-based check that evaluates whether the model's answer is relevant to the question.

    Uses an LLM to judge if the final answer directly and appropriately addresses the
    final question, taking into account the full conversation history. This prevents
    the judge from mis-scoring locally-reasonable answers that are off-topic given
    prior turns (e.g., a zoology answer to a programming question).

    Only the **current** turn (``question`` / ``answer``) is scored. Prior turns are
    passed as read-only history so the judge can understand user intent—not to
    penalise earlier irrelevant exchanges.

    Attributes
    ----------
    question : str | MISSING
        The question to evaluate relevance against. When provided, takes priority
        over ``question_key``. If omitted, extracted from the trace using ``question_key``.
    question_key : JSONPathStr
        JSONPath expression to extract the question from the trace
        (default: ``"trace.last.inputs"``).
    answer : str | MISSING
        The answer to evaluate. When provided, takes priority over ``target_key``.
        If omitted, extracted from the trace using ``target_key``.
    target_key : JSONPathStr
        JSONPath expression to extract the answer from the trace
        (default: ``"trace.last.outputs"``).
    context : str | MISSING
        Optional domain context that describes the chatbot's purpose or scope
        (e.g., ``"This is a chatbot that answers questions about programming languages"``).
        Not extracted from the trace—supply directly when needed. Defaults to an
        empty string when omitted.
    include_history : bool
        Whether to pass the conversation history to the judge (default: ``True``).
        Set to ``False`` to score the current turn in isolation, omitting the
        ``<CONVERSATION HISTORY>`` section from the prompt entirely.

    Notes
    -----
    When ``question_key`` or ``target_key`` matches nothing in the trace, the check
    returns ``CheckStatus.ERROR`` without invoking the judge. History is supporting
    context only: the judge is instructed to score the resolved question/answer and
    never to substitute a question inferred from history, so a misconfigured key
    surfaces as an error instead of being silently rescued.
