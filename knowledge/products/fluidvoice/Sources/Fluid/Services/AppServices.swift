//  AppServices.swift
//  Fluid
//
//  Centralized service container to reduce SwiftUI view type complexity.
//  By holding heavy services here (outside ContentView's @StateObject declarations),
//  we reduce the generic type signature of ContentView, which helps avoid
//  Swift runtime type metadata crashes at app launch.
//
//  DEFENSIVE STRATEGY (2025-12-21):
//  This file implements multiple layers of defense against startup crashes:
//  1. Services are lazily initialized (not created until first access)
//  2. A startup gate prevents any heavy work before UI is ready
//  3. Combined with the 1.5s delay in ContentView for belt-and-suspenders approach
//
