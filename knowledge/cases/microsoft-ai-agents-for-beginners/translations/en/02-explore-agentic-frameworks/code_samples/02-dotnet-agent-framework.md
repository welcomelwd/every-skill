# 🔍 Exploring Microsoft Agent Framework - Basic Agent (.NET)

## 📋 Learning Objectives

This example explores the fundamental concepts of the Microsoft Agent Framework through a basic agent implementation in .NET. You'll learn core agentic patterns and understand how intelligent agents work under the hood using C# and the .NET ecosystem.

### What You'll Discover

## 📚 Framework Comparison

This example demonstrates the Microsoft Agent Framework approach compared to other agentic frameworks:

| Feature | Microsoft Agent Framework | Other Frameworks |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Integration** | Native Microsoft ecosystem | Varied compatibility |
| **Simplicity** | Clean, intuitive API | Often complex setup |
| **Extensibility** | Easy tool integration | Framework-dependent |
| **Enterprise Ready** | Built for production | Varies by framework |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) or higher
- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with an Azure OpenAI resource and a model deployment
- The [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) — sign in with `az login`

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# zsh/bash
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.openai.azure.com
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-5-mini
# Then sign in so AzureCliCredential can get a token
az login
```

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-resource>.openai.azure.com"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT = "gpt-5-mini"
# Then sign in so AzureCliCredential can get a token
az login
```

### Sample Code

To run the code example,

```bash
# zsh/bash
chmod +x ./02-dotnet-agent-framework.cs
./02-dotnet-agent-framework.cs
```

Or using the dotnet CLI:

```bash
dotnet run ./02-dotnet-agent-framework.cs
```

See [`02-dotnet-agent-framework.cs`](../../../../02-explore-agentic-frameworks/code_samples/02-dotnet-agent-framework.cs) for the complete code.

You are a helpful AI Agent that can help plan vacations for customers.

Important: When users specify a destination, always plan for that location. Only suggest random destinations when the user hasn't specified a preference.

When the conversation begins, introduce yourself with this message:
"Hello! I'm your TravelAgent assistant. I can help plan vacations and suggest interesting destinations for you. Here are some things you can ask me:
1. Plan a day trip to a specific location
2. Suggest a random vacation destination
3. Find destinations with specific features (beaches, mountains, historical sites, etc.)
4. Plan an alternative trip if you don't like my first suggestion

What kind of trip would you like me to help you plan today?"

Always prioritize user preferences. If they mention a specific destination like "Bali" or "Paris," focus your planning on that location rather than suggesting alternatives.

// Create AI Agent with Advanced Travel Planning Capabilities
// Get the Responses client for the deployment and create the AI agent
// Configure agent with name, detailed instructions, and available tools
// This demonstrates the .NET agent creation pattern with full configuration
AIAgent agent = azureClient
    .GetChatClient(deployment)
    .AsAIAgent(
        name: AGENT_NAME,
        instructions: AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS,
        tools: [AIFunctionFactory.Create(GetRandomDestination)]
    );

// Create New Session for Context Management.
// Initialize a new conversation session to maintain context across multiple interactions
// Sessions enable the agent to remember previous exchanges and maintain conversational state
// This is essential for multi-turn conversations and contextual understanding
AgentSession session = await agent.CreateSessionAsync();

// Execute Agent: First Travel Planning Request
// Run the agent with an initial request that will likely trigger the random destination tool
// The agent will analyze the request, use the GetRandomDestination tool, and create an itinerary
// Using the session parameter maintains conversation context for subsequent interactions
await foreach (var update in agent.RunStreamingAsync("Plan me a day trip", session))
{
    await Task.Delay(10);
    Console.Write(update);
}

Console.WriteLine();

// Execute Agent: Follow-up Request with Context Awareness
// Demonstrate contextual conversation by referencing the previous response
// The agent remembers the previous destination suggestion and will provide an alternative
// This showcases the power of conversation sessions and contextual understanding in .NET agents
await foreach (var update in agent.RunStreamingAsync("I don't like that destination. Plan me another vacation.", session))
{
    await Task.Delay(10);
    Console.Write(update);
}
```

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

1. **Agent Architecture**: The Microsoft Agent Framework provides a clean, type-safe approach to building AI agents in .NET
2. **Tool Integration**: Functions decorated with `[Description]` attributes become available tools for the agent
3. **Conversation Context**: Session management enables multi-turn conversations with full context awareness
4. **Configuration Management**: Environment variables and secure credential handling follow .NET best practices
5. **Azure OpenAI Responses API**: The agent uses the Azure OpenAI Responses API through the Azure.AI.OpenAI SDK
