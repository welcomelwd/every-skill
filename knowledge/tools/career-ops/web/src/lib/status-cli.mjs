 * not parse. The route then reports 500 for a write the CLI already committed,
 * losing `changed` and `statusLogged` with it.
 *
 * So the document is read from the end: the last line that parses as a plain
 * object is the result. A diagnostic that happens to be valid JSON cannot shadow
 * it, because the result is printed last.
