// tests/portal-health-path.test.mjs — appendPortalHealth()/loadPortalHealth()

// scan.mjs lives in.
//
// Every sibling data path in scan.mjs (SCAN_HISTORY_PATH, PIPELINE_PATH,
// APPLICATIONS_PATH, BLACKLIST_PATH, SCAN_RUNS_PATH) is a bare cwd-relative
// string. PORTAL_HEALTH_PATH used to be the one exception, resolved via
// path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)) -- the script's own directory.
// Any invocation with a sandboxed cwd (a test run, a temp dir, a CI checkout)
// still wrote fixture rows straight into the real data/portal-health.tsv of
// whatever checkout happens to own scan.mjs, polluting real pipeline data with
// test fixtures.
//
// This spawns a real child process with cwd pinned to a temp dir that is NOT
// the directory scan.mjs lives in, then calls appendPortalHealth() with no
// filePath argument -- the exact call scan.mjs's own production code path
// makes. The row must land under the given cwd, and the script's own
// directory must be provably untouched.
