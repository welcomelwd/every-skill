# Contributing to Code Graph RAG

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Code Graph RAG! We welcome contributions from the community. How the project is run, who decides what, and how to become a maintainer are described in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## Getting Started

1. **Browse Issues**: Check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag/issues) to find tasks that need work
   - Look for issues labelled `good first issue` for beginner-friendly tasks
   - Issues labelled `help wanted` are open for community contributions
2. **Pick an Issue**: Choose an issue that interests you and matches your skill level
3. **Comment on the Issue**: Let us know you're working on it to avoid duplicate effort
4. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork to work on
5. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name like `feat/add-feature` or `fix/bug-description`

### Issue Labels

Our repository uses standardised labels to categorise issues and PRs:

| Label              | Purpose                                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bug`              | Something isn't working correctly                                 |
| `enhancement`      | New feature or improvement request                                |
| `documentation`    | Documentation improvements                                        |
| `question`         | Questions about usage or functionality                            |
| `good first issue` | Good for newcomers                                                |
| `help wanted`      | Extra attention needed from the community                         |
| `poor-quality`     | PR doesn't meet contribution standards (auto-closed after 7 days) |
| `language support` | Related to programming language support                           |
| `performance`      | Performance improvements                                          |
| `security`         | Security vulnerability or concern                                 |
| `tests`            | Related to testing                                                |
| `ci/cd`            | CI/CD improvements                                                |

Labels are automatically synced from [`.github/labels.yml`](.github/labels.yml).

## Development Process

1. **Set up Development Environment**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/code-graph-rag.git
   cd code-graph-rag
   make dev
   ```

2. **Install Pre-commit Hooks** (mandatory):
   Handled by Makefile in `make dev`, but if needed separately:

   ```bash
    pre-commit install
    pre-commit autoupdate
   ```

   All commits must pass pre-commit checks. Do not skip hooks with `--no-verify`.

3. **Make Your Changes**:
   - Follow the existing code style and patterns
   - Add tests: this is project policy, not a suggestion. New functionality must come with tests that exercise it, and bug fixes must include a regression test that fails without the fix
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Do not add inline comments (see Comment Policy below)

4. **Test Your Changes**:
   - Run the existing tests to ensure nothing is broken
   - Test your new functionality thoroughly
   - Run `uv run ruff check` and `uv run ruff format --check` before committing

5. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   - Push your branch to your fork
   - Create a pull request against the main repository
   - Reference the issue number in your PR description
   - Provide a clear description of what you've changed and why

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single issue or feature
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Tests are required for new functionality and for bug fixes; PRs adding major functionality without tests will not be merged
- Update documentation when necessary
- Be responsive to feedback during code review

### Continuous Integration

All pull requests are automatically validated by our CI workflow, which runs in parallel for faster feedback:

1. **Lint & Format** - Code style validation:
   - `ruff check` with GitHub annotations
   - `ruff format --check`

2. **Type Check** - Static type analysis:
   - `ty check` on production code (excludes tests)

3. **Unit Tests** - Fast tests without Docker:
   - Parallel execution with `pytest-xdist`
   - Code coverage reporting to Codecov

4. **Integration Tests** - Full stack testing:
   - Tests with real Memgraph database
   - Service container orchestration
   - Code coverage reporting to Codecov

5. **PR Title Validation** - Conventional Commits format check

All checks run in parallel and must pass before a PR can be merged. A summary job verifies all checks succeeded.

**Run checks locally before pushing:**

```bash
make lint          # Lint check
make format        # Apply formatting (ruff format writes files; CI uses ruff format --check)
make typecheck     # Type check
make test-parallel # Unit tests in parallel
make test-integration  # Integration tests (requires Docker)
```

**Or run all at once:**

```bash
make check      # Runs lint + typecheck + test
make pre-commit # Runs ALL pre-commit checks (comprehensive - mirrors CI)
```

The `make pre-commit` command runs the exact same checks as your pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline, including:
- Code formatting verification
- Linting
- Type checking
- Documentation checks
- README generation
- Security scanning
- Unit tests

Use this before committing to catch issues early.

### Automated Code Review

This project uses automated code review bots (**Greptile** and **Gemini Code Assist**) to provide initial feedback on PRs. Before requesting a human review:

1. **Address all bot comments**: Every comment from Greptile and Gemini Code Assist must be resolved
2. **Accept or push back**: For each bot suggestion, either:
   - **Accept**: Implement the suggestion and resolve the comment
   - **Push back**: Reply inline with a clear justification for why the suggestion doesn't apply
3. **Iterate as needed**: Continue addressing new bot comments through multiple review rounds until all are resolved
4. **Then request human review**: Only after all bot comments are cleared, assign the PR to core maintainers for human review

This process ensures that human reviewers focus on high-level design and logic rather than style and common issues that bots can catch.

## Technical Requirements

### Agentic Framework

- **PydanticAI for now**: PydanticAI is the agentic framework the project runs on today. That is a current choice, not a permanent commitment, and a well-argued case for moving is welcome. What it does rule out is arriving at a second framework by accident, so do not introduce one (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) as part of a feature pull request. Open an issue first, as `GOVERNANCE.md` asks for architectural decisions.

### External Service Integrations

Integrations with external services (search APIs, model hosts, data providers) are welcome, on these terms:

- **Free tier only**: The open-source tree carries capability that works without payment. Do not add configuration that selects a vendor's paid plan, and do not document a route to one. Paid capability belongs in [Enterprise Services](https://code-graph-rag.com/enterprise), not in an environment variable here.
- **No single-vendor lock**: A generic capability resolves its backend from configuration, the way model and embedding providers already do in `codebase_rag/config.py`. A capability that works only for holders of one vendor's key is not a capability this project has.
- **Keyless default**: Where a provider needs no account, it is the default, so the feature works on a fresh checkout.
- **Disclose affiliation**: If you work for, or are compensated by, the service you are integrating, say so in the pull request description.

### Code Standards

- **Heavy Pydantic Usage**: Use Pydantic models extensively for data validation, serialisation, and configuration
- **Package Management**: Use `uv` for all dependency management and virtual environments
- **Code Quality**: Use `ruff` for linting and formatting - run `ruff check` and `ruff format` before submitting
- **Type Safety**: Use type hints everywhere and run `uv run ty check` for type checking

### Development Tools

- **uv**: Package manager and dependency resolver
- **ruff**: Code linting and formatting (replaces flake8, black, isort)
- **ty**: Static type checking (from Astral)
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **ripgrep** (`rg`): Required for shell command text searching (install via `brew install ripgrep` on macOS or `apt install ripgrep` on Linux)

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses `pre-commit` to automatically run checks before each commit, ensuring code quality and consistency.

To get started, first make sure you have the development dependencies installed:

```bash
make dev
```

Then, install the git hooks:
Automatically via Makefile in `make dev`, but if needed separately:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
```

Now, `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`.

## Coding Standards

### Tooling

All tooling is from [Astral](https://astral.sh):

| Tool     | Purpose                | Command                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **uv**   | Package management     | `uv sync`, `uv add`, `uv run`             |
| **ty**   | Type checking          | `uv run ty check`                         |
| **ruff** | Linting and formatting | `uv run ruff check`, `uv run ruff format` |

```bash
# Sync dependencies
make python

# Upgrade a package
uv sync --upgrade-package <pkg>

# Type check (excludes test files)
uv run ty check codebase_rag --exclude codebase_rag/tests

# Lint and format
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run ruff format .
```

### Type System

#### Data Structure Selection

| Structure              | Use Case                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **StrEnum**            | Constrained string constants used in comparisons, defaults, assignments |
| **NamedTuple**         | Immutable records with named fields (lightweight, hashable)             |
| **TypedDict**          | Dict shapes for function return types or JSON-like data                 |
| **dataclass**          | Mutable class instances with behaviour/methods                           |
| **Pydantic BaseModel** | Configs needing validation, serialisation, or schema generation         |

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import StrEnum
from typing import NamedTuple, TypedDict

# StrEnum - string constants
class Status(StrEnum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    DONE = "done"

# NamedTuple - immutable record
class Point(NamedTuple):
    x: float
    y: float

# TypedDict - dict shape
class Result(TypedDict):
    success: bool
    data: str

# dataclass - mutable with behavior
@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    def greet(self) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {self.name}"
```

#### Strict Typing

- Use `Literal` types for constrained string values used only as type hints
- Use `StrEnum` when values need defaults or are used in code (not just type hints)
- Never use loose dict types like `dict[str, Any]` or `dict[str, str | int | None]` - use TypedDict instead
- Use explicit TypedDict constructors instead of plain dict literals

#### No Forward References (Quoted Type Hints)

Forward references are type hints wrapped in quotes like `"ASTNode"`. These are NOT allowed.

**How to identify forward references:**

- Type hints with quotes: `def foo(x: "SomeClass") -> "Result"`
- These appear when a type is used before it's defined or to avoid circular imports

**How to fix forward references:**

- Add `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of the file
- Remove the quotes from the type hints

**IMPORTANT:** Only add `from __future__ import annotations` to files that HAVE forward references. Do NOT add it to files that don't need it.

```python
# Bad - forward reference with quotes (THIS IS NOT ALLOWED)
def process(node: "ASTNode") -> "Result": ...

# Good - add future import and remove quotes
from __future__ import annotations

def process(node: ASTNode) -> Result: ...
```

```python
# Bad - loose dict type
def process(args: dict[str, str | int | None]) -> dict[str, Any]: ...

# Good - TypedDict with known shape
class ProcessArgs(TypedDict):
    name: str
    count: int

def process(args: ProcessArgs) -> Result: ...

# Bad - dict literal
return {"success": True, "data": data}

# Good - TypedDict constructor
return Result(success=True, data=data)
```

#### Methods Over Callable Attributes

In Protocols and mixin classes, use regular method definitions instead of `Callable` attributes. Callables are not bound (don't receive `self` implicitly) and descriptors are not invoked.

```python
from abc import abstractmethod
from typing import Callable, Protocol

# Bad - Callable attribute (not bound, not recommended)
class MyMixin:
    process: Callable[[str], int]

class MyProtocol(Protocol):
    handler: Callable[[str, int], bool]

# Good - regular method definition
# Mixin classes: use @abstractmethod for method stubs
class MyMixin:
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, data: str) -> int: ...

# Protocols: no decorator needed (structural typing)
class MyProtocol(Protocol):
    def handler(self, name: str, count: int) -> bool: ...
```

Only use `Callable` attributes when reusing complex callable types is necessary.

### Code Organisation

#### File Structure

Standard files in each module:

- `types_defs.py` - Type aliases, TypedDicts, NamedTuples (immutable structural types)
- `models.py` - Dataclasses only (runtime data structures with behaviour)
- `constants.py` - StrEnums, string literals, and application constants
- `config.py` - Pydantic settings, environment config, and runtime configuration instances
- `schemas.py` - All Pydantic BaseModel classes (data transfer objects, results, responses)
- `logs.py` - Log message templates for logger calls (info, debug, warning, error, success)
- `tool_errors.py` - Error messages returned by tools to the LLM/user
- `exceptions.py` - Exception classes and their error message templates (for raise statements)

#### Modularisation

- Soft rule: keep files under 700 lines (after linting); split larger files into submodules
- Group related functionality into submodules (e.g., `stem_ops/`, `tools/`, `srg_parser/`)
- Use descriptive file names that reflect purpose (e.g., `editor.py`, `factory.py`, `loader.py`)
- Each submodule can have its own `__init__.py` to expose public API

#### Import Conventions

- Import from the module's public API, not internal files:

```python
# Bad
from policy_digitization_tasks.srg_parser.editor import apply_edits

# Good
from policy_digitization_tasks.srg_parser import apply_edits
```

- Group imports: stdlib, third-party, local (separated by blank lines)
- Use explicit imports, avoid `from module import *`

#### Two-Letter Aliases for Bulk Imports

When importing 5+ items from a module, use module-level import with a 2-letter alias:

```python
# Bad - many lines of imports
from .constants import (
    CLI_ERR_CONFIG,
    CLI_MSG_DONE,
    Color,
    Provider,
    # ... 20 more items
)

# Good - 1 line with 2-letter alias
from . import constants as cs
from . import exceptions as ex
from . import tool_errors as te
from . import logs as ls

# Usage
logger.info(ls.PROCESSING_FILE.format(path=path))
raise ex.LLMGenerationError(ex.CONFIG.format(error=e))
```

#### Single Source of Truth

Define constants, patterns, and types once. Import everywhere.

#### StrEnum for Constrained Values

Use `StrEnum` when string values are used in code (defaults, comparisons, assignments):

```python
from enum import StrEnum

# Bad - hardcoded strings scattered in code
def process(mode: str = "fast"): ...
if status == "pending": ...

# Good - centralized StrEnum
class Mode(StrEnum):
    FAST = "fast"
    SLOW = "slow"

def process(mode: Mode = Mode.FAST): ...
if status == Status.PENDING: ...
```

#### Centralised Error Messages

Use an Enum with `__call__` for parameterised error messages:

```python
from enum import Enum

class Error(str, Enum):
    NOT_FOUND = "Item '{id}' not found"
    INVALID = "Invalid value"

    def __call__(self, **kwargs) -> str:
        return self.value.format(**kwargs) if kwargs else self.value

# Usage
raise ValueError(Error.NOT_FOUND(id="abc"))
```

#### Error Codes as StrEnum

Use `StrEnum` for error type names passed to exception classes:

```python
class ErrorCode(StrEnum):
    VALIDATION = "ValidationError"
    NOT_FOUND = "NotFoundError"

raise CustomError(ErrorCode.VALIDATION, Error.INVALID())
```

### Code Style

#### Loguru Over Print

Use `loguru` for all output instead of `print`:

```python
# Bad
print(f"Processing: {file}")
print(f"Error: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Good
from loguru import logger
logger.info(f"Processing: {file}")
logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
logger.success("Done!")
```

#### Typer Over Argparse

Use `typer` for CLI argument parsing instead of `argparse`:

```python
# Bad
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("name", type=str)
parser.add_argument("--count", type=int, default=1)
args = parser.parse_args()

# Good
from typing import Annotated
import typer

def main(
    name: Annotated[str, typer.Argument(help="Name")],
    count: Annotated[int, typer.Option(help="Count")] = 1,
) -> None:
    ...

typer.run(main)
```

#### Click for Nested Command Groups

Use `click` with `@click.group()` for nested subcommand groups that integrate with a typer main app:

- Typer's `add_typer()` requires more boilerplate for this pattern
- Bridge typer → click via `ctx.args` and `standalone_mode=False`
- Use `click.echo()`/`click.secho()` for user-facing CLI output (not logging)
- Add `loguru` for actual error logging in exception handlers

```python
# subcommands.py - click subcommand group
@click.group(help="Manage resources")
def cli() -> None:
    pass

@cli.command(help="Add a new resource.")
def add(name: str) -> None:
    try:
        do_add(name)
        click.echo(f"Added {name}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to add: {e}")  # loguru for logging
        click.secho(f"Error: {e}", fg="red")  # click for user output

# main.py - typer main app bridges to click
from .subcommands import cli as subcommand_cli

@app.command(
    name="resource",
    context_settings={"allow_extra_args": True, "allow_interspersed_args": False},
)
def resource_command(ctx: typer.Context) -> None:
    subcommand_cli(ctx.args, standalone_mode=False)
```

#### No Lambdas as Dict Values

Use dataclasses with methods instead:

```python
# Bad
HANDLERS = {
    "create": lambda x: {"action": "create", "id": x.id},
}

# Good
@dataclass
class Handler:
    action: str
    template: str

    def build(self, x) -> ActionDict:
        return ActionDict(action=self.action, id=x.id)

HANDLERS = {"create": Handler(action="create", template="...")}
```

#### Match Statements Over Elif Chains

```python
# Bad
if action == "create":
    return handle_create(data)
elif action == "update":
    return handle_update(data)
else:
    return handle_default(action, data)

# Good
match action:
    case "create":
        return handle_create(data)
    case "update":
        return handle_update(data)
    case other:
        return handle_default(other, data)
```

#### Swap If-Else When If Body Is Empty

When the if body does nothing (`pass`) and all logic is in the else clause, invert the condition and remove the empty else:

```python
# Bad - empty if body with logic in else
if location == OUTSIDE:
    pass
else:
    take_off_hat()

# Good - inverted condition, no empty else
if location != OUTSIDE:
    take_off_hat()
```

This also applies when the if body is a guard condition that allows dropping the else entirely.

#### Named Expressions for Assignment + Condition

Use named expressions (`:=`) to merge assignment followed by a conditional check:

```python
# Bad - separate assignment and condition
env_base = os.environ.get("PYTHONUSERBASE", None)
if env_base:
    return env_base

chunk = file.read(8192)
while chunk:
    process(chunk)
    chunk = file.read(8192)

# Good - named expression
if env_base := os.environ.get("PYTHONUSERBASE", None):
    return env_base

while chunk := file.read(8192):
    process(chunk)
```

Named expressions can also simplify nested conditions:

```python
# Bad - nested if statements
if self._is_special:
    ans = self._check_nans(context=context)
    if ans:
        return ans

# Good - merged with named expression
if self._is_special and (ans := self._check_nans(context=context)):
    return ans
```

#### Inline Unnecessary Helpers

If a helper function is trivial and used once, inline it.

#### Move Assignments Close to Usage

Declare variables as close to their usage as possible to minimise cognitive load and prevent stranded variables:

```python
# Bad - assignment far from usage
cubes = []
function_unrelated_to_cubes()
if another_unrelated_condition():
    more_unrelated_logic()
for i in range(20):
    cubes.append(i**3)

# Good - assignment immediately before usage
function_unrelated_to_cubes()
if another_unrelated_condition():
    more_unrelated_logic()
cubes = []
for i in range(20):
    cubes.append(i**3)
```

#### DRY Reduction

Extract repeated code blocks into helpers:

```python
# Bad - same 4 lines repeated 3 times (12 lines)
def save_user(user):
    conn = db.connect()
    conn.execute(SQL_USER, user.dict())
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def save_order(order):
    conn = db.connect()
    conn.execute(SQL_ORDER, order.dict())
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def save_item(item):
    conn = db.connect()
    conn.execute(SQL_ITEM, item.dict())
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Good - helper + 3 one-liners (7 lines)
def _save(sql: str, data: dict) -> None:
    conn = db.connect()
    conn.execute(sql, data)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def save_user(user):
    _save(SQL_USER, user.dict())

def save_order(order):
    _save(SQL_ORDER, order.dict())

def save_item(item):
    _save(SQL_ITEM, item.dict())
```

#### No Type Ignores, Casts, Any, or object

Never use `# type: ignore` comments, `cast()`, `Any` type, or `object` as a type hint. These provide no useful type information. Fix the underlying type issue using proper typing, type narrowing, specific union types (e.g., `str | int | bool | None`), or TypedDict for dict values.

#### No Hardcoded Strings

All repeated string literals should be constants or StrEnum members:

```python
# Bad
if node.type == "predicate_definition": ...
artifact_type = "srg_v1"

# Good
if node.type == ElementType.PREDICATE: ...
artifact_type = ARTIFACT_SRG
```

#### Almost No Strings in Code Files

Files that are NOT `config.py`, `models.py`, `constants.py`, `logs.py`, or CLI modules should have almost no string literals. Move all strings to:

- `logs.py` - all log messages (info, debug, warning, error, success)
- `constants.py` - non-log constants, StrEnums, format strings
- `tool_descriptions.py` - tool/function descriptions (for tools modules)
- `config.py` - configuration defaults

```python
# Bad - strings in service/tool files
logger.info(f"Processing file: {path}")
description="Reads file content from disk."

# Good - import from dedicated modules
from .. import logs
from . import tool_descriptions as td

logger.info(logs.PROCESSING_FILE.format(path=path))
description=td.FILE_READER
```

#### Function Signatures Use Proper Types

Use StrEnum types in function signatures, not `str`:

```python
# Bad
def extract(guideline_type: str, outcome: str = "Approve"): ...

# Good
def extract(guideline_type: GuidelineType, outcome: OutcomeType = OutcomeType.APPROVE): ...
```

### Validation

Use Pydantic `model_validator` for cross-field validation:

```python
class Config(BaseModel):
    options: list[str] | None = None
    default: str = "fallback"

    @model_validator(mode="after")
    def validate_default_in_options(self):
        if self.options and self.default not in self.options:
            raise ValueError(f"default '{self.default}' must be in options")
        return self
```

### Git Commits

- Conventional Commits format
- One-liner only
- No emoji
- No attribution or Co-Authored-By

### PR Title Convention

Uses Conventional Commits format with this regex pattern:

```
^(build|chore|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|p?refactor|revert|style|test)(\([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\))?!?: .+$
```

**Allowed prefixes:**

| Prefix                    | Purpose                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `build`                   | Build system or external dependencies |
| `chore`                   | Routine tasks, maintenance            |

### Comment Policy

Write comments that explain **why** and **how**, not **what**. A comment that only restates the adjacent code adds no value; one that captures a non-obvious reason, a tricky invariant, or a concrete edge case earns its place.
