"""Anchor generated artefacts to the operation their contract declares.

The artefacts already exist: an RPC resource where a generated client and
server meet by service and method, an ENDPOINT resource where a generated
server registers a route. This pass adds the contract's own name for each
operation as one CONTRACT resource and resolves those artefacts into it, so
one node answers "who implements this operation" across every language, and
an operation whose client and server disagree on the path (or whose client
carries no URL literal at all) is still joined.
