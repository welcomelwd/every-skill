"""Contract files as the canonical name of a service operation (issue #912).

In a contract-first repo neither side of a service call is written by hand:
the client stub and the server handler are both generated, they share no
symbol, and often no URL literal either. What they do share is the operation
the contract declares, so an OpenAPI ``operationId`` and a protobuf ``rpc``
each become one CONTRACT resource that the generated artefacts resolve into.

Discovery is deliberately narrow. A JSON or YAML document counts as a spec
only when it declares ``openapi``/``swagger`` and a ``paths`` mapping, so the
manifests, lockfiles and fixtures every repo is full of contribute nothing,
and a ``.proto`` yields operations only from inside a ``service`` block.
