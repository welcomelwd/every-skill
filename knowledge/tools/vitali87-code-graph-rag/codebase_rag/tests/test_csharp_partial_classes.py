# C# Phase 3 tail: partial-class member unification. A class split across
# files with `partial` is one logical type; a typed receiver must resolve to
# members and bases declared on ANY part, not just the receiver's own part.
# (Unique-name calls already resolve via the generic fallback; these tests
# use decoys so only cross-part typed resolution can bind them.)
