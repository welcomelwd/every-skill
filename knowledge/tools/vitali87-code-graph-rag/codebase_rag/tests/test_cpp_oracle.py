# Covers the C++ structure oracle (evals/oracles/cpp_oracle.py): a libclang
# oracle driven by a compile_commands.json resolves #includes and expands
# macros to the true translation-unit AST, which tree-sitter cannot do. cgr's
# C++ nodes, containment edges, and spans are graded against it on
# (kind, file, start_line). The sample exercises a header-declared class, a
# macro-typed method, out-of-class definitions, a constructor, an inline
# method, a struct, and a free function.
