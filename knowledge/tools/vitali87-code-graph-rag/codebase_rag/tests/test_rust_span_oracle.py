# Covers Rust node SPAN (end_line) validation: cgr's end_line is graded against
# the syn oracle (which emits the whole-node span end), joined on (kind, file,
# start). Exercises doc comments, multi-line attributes, a signature, a
# where-clause, and a closure so the span is not trivially the start line.
