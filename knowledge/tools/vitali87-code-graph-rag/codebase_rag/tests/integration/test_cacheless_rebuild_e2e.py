"""A rebuild without a hash cache must not accumulate stale graph state.

The cache lives in the repo working tree, so a fresh clone (or a deleted
cache) has none while the shared database still holds the project. Every
file then counts as "new", the per-file delete-before-reingest is skipped,
and symbols renamed or removed since the previous index linger alongside
the fresh parse, stale CALLS/REFERENCES edges included.
