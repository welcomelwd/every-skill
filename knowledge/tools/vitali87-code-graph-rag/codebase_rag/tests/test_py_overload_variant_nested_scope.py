# A Python function whose qn carries a duplicate-variant suffix (click's
# `command`: @t.overload stubs claim the natural qn, the REAL def registers as
# `command@168`) calls its own nested `decorator`. The enclosing-scope walk
# probed `command@168.decorator`, which never exists (the nested registers
# under the NATURAL qn `command.decorator`), so resolution mis-bound to a
# sibling's `argument.decorator`. The walk must also probe the stripped scope.
