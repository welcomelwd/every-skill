# When several files each declare a same-named nested class (gson has
# CollectionTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter, MapTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter,
# ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory.Adapter), a subclass `class Sub extends Adapter`
# must inherit from the Adapter nested in ITS OWN file, not a same-named one in
# another file that merely sorts first. A wrong INHERITS sends the method-override
# edges to the wrong base, so the subclass overrides look dead.
