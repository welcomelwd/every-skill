# A full build asks the graph which of this project's modules already exist
# so their subtrees are deleted before reingest. A sink that claims
# readability but fails the query leaves the graph state UNKNOWN: treating it
# as empty skips every delete and recreates the stale-accumulation corruption
# the probe exists to prevent. The only safe answer is to delete-before-
# reingest every current file (deleting an absent module is a no-op).
