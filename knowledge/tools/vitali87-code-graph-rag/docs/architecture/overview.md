# Architecture Overview

Code-Graph-RAG consists of two main components that work together to analyse and query codebases.

## Components

### 1. Multi-Language Parser

A Tree-sitter based parsing system that analyses codebases and ingests data into Memgraph.

- Uses Tree-sitter for robust, language-agnostic AST parsing
- Extracts functions, classes, methods, modules, and their relationships
- Supports 13 programming languages with a unified graph schema (plus Scala in development)
- Handles complex patterns like nested functions, class hierarchies, and cross-module calls

### 2. RAG System (`codebase_rag/`)

An interactive CLI for querying the stored knowledge graph.

- Translates natural language questions into Cypher queries
- Retrieves source code snippets for found elements
- Supports AI-powered code editing with AST-based targeting
- Provides code optimisation with interactive approval workflow

## Data Flow

```
Source Code → Tree-sitter Parser → AST Analysis → Memgraph Knowledge Graph
                                                          ↓
User Query → AI Model (Cypher Gen) → Cypher Query → Graph Results → Response
```
