# I/O and Data-Flow Edges

This page explains the three relationships that model how code touches external
resources and how values move between them: `READS_FROM`, `WRITES_TO`, and
`FLOWS_TO`. For the one-line schema summary see [Graph Schema](graph-schema.md);
this page is the detailed reference.

All three are **opt-in**. They belong to the `io` capture group, which is
excluded from the default capture set, so a default build emits none of them and
does no extra work. Enable them with the `io` capture group (see
[Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md)).

## The mental model: taint

The design borrows the vocabulary of **taint analysis**, a standard technique in
program analysis. The idea is a drop of dye in water: mark a value where it
enters the program, then follow it wherever it spreads.

- A **source** is where a value enters from the outside world (reading an
  environment variable, a file, a socket). A value read from a source is
  **tainted** — it carries a note about *where it came from*.
- **Propagation** is how that note travels: through assignments, into function
  calls as arguments, and back out through return values.
- A **sink** is where a value leaves for the outside world (writing to standard
  output, to a file, over the network).

"Taint" carries no other meaning here. When the docs say *"`x` is tainted by
`ENV::K`"*, read it as *"`x` holds a value that originated at the `ENV::K`
resource, and the analysis is tracking it until it is written out or
overwritten."* Turning that tracking into graph edges is what lets a single
query answer *does anything from this source reach that sink?*

## Resource nodes

Sources and sinks are represented by synthetic `Resource` nodes. A resource
qualified name has the form `resource::<KIND>::<identity>`:

- `identity` is the static string literal target when one is available (a file
  path, an environment variable name) and `<dynamic>` when the target is not a
  compile-time constant (for example `open(path)` where `path` is a variable,
  or standard streams that have no literal target).
- `KIND` is one of eight values. The table shows what each represents and, for
  the current Python registry, which calls produce it and in which direction.

| `KIND` | Represents | Detected from (Python) | Direction |
|--------|------------|------------------------|-----------|
| `FILE` | A file on disk | `open(...)` and its handle methods (`.read`, `.write`, …); `json.load` / `json.dump` | read + write |
| `ENV` | An environment variable | `os.getenv(...)`, `os.environ.get(...)` | read |
| `NETWORK` | A network endpoint / URL | `requests.get` / `.head`, `urllib.request.urlopen`, `httpx.get` (read); `requests.post` / `.put` / `.patch` / `.delete`, `httpx.post` (write); `httpx.Client` / `AsyncClient` and `aiohttp.ClientSession` handle methods | read + write |
| `DATABASE` | A database connection | `sqlite3.connect(...)` handle methods (`.execute`, `.fetchone`, `.commit`, …) | read + write |
| `SOCKET` | A network socket | `socket.socket(...)` handle methods (`.recv`, `.send`, …) | read + write |
| `STDOUT` | Standard output | `print(...)` | write |
| `STDIN` | Standard input | *(defined in the schema; no Python source registered yet)* | — |
| `STDERR` | Standard error | *(defined in the schema; no Python source registered yet)* | — |

Example: `os.getenv("K")` refers to `resource::ENV::K`; `print(x)` refers to
`resource::STDOUT::<dynamic>`. The registry is extended in
`codebase_rag/parsers/io_access/registry.py`. The Python registry does not yet
register `STDIN` or `STDERR` sources/sinks, but other languages emit them
(for example C `scanf`, C++ `std::cerr`, Java `System.err`, C# `Console.Error`).

## READS_FROM and WRITES_TO

These connect a **callable to a resource** it touches. The direction is decided
by the call and (for file handles) its mode:

| Code | Edge |
|------|------|
| `os.getenv("K")` | `Function -READS_FROM-> Resource(ENV::K)` |
| `print(x)` | `Function -WRITES_TO-> Resource(STDOUT::<dynamic>)` |
| `open("out.txt", "w")` | `Function -WRITES_TO-> Resource(FILE::out.txt)` |
| `open("cfg.yaml")` | `Function -READS_FROM-> Resource(FILE::cfg.yaml)` |

The source of the edge is the **immediate** enclosing scope of the call — the
`Function`, `Method`, or `Module` that directly contains it. A read or write
inside a nested function is attributed to that nested function alone, never
bubbled up to an enclosing function or the module. (This matches how `CALLS` is
attributed, and how `FLOWS_TO` treats nested scopes below.)

## FLOWS_TO

`FLOWS_TO` records **value flow**: that a value moved from one place to another.
It turns provenance questions into plain graph reachability. Every `FLOWS_TO`
edge carries two properties that say *what kind of flow it is* and *how the value
travelled*:

```
FLOWS_TO  ·  <kind>  ·  <via>
   │            │          │
relationship   which of    the channel the
type (always   the three   value crossed
FLOWS_TO)      shapes      through
```

`kind` is the primary category; `via` is the precise channel, present on two of
the three shapes. All three below come from one function body:

```python
def build():
    return os.getenv("K")      # build returns a value read from ENV::K

def forward(v):
    print(v)

def leak():
    x = os.getenv("K")         # x now carries ENV::K
    print(x)                   # shape 1
    t = os.getenv("T")
    forward(t)                 # shape 2
    r = build()
    print(r)                   # shape 3
```

The three `FLOWS_TO` edges that body produces:

<div class="cgr-flow">
  <div class="edge">
    <span class="node res">ENV::K</span>
    <span class="arrow flows"><span class="rel">FLOWS_TO · resource</span></span>
    <span class="node res">STDOUT::&lt;dynamic&gt;</span>
  </div>
  <div class="edge">
    <span class="node code">flow.leak</span>
    <span class="arrow flows"><span class="rel">FLOWS_TO · arg · arg:0</span></span>
    <span class="node code">flow.forward</span>
  </div>
  <div class="edge">
    <span class="node code">flow.build</span>
    <span class="arrow flows"><span class="rel">FLOWS_TO · return · return</span></span>
    <span class="node code">flow.leak</span>
  </div>
  <div class="legend">
    <span><i class="node res" style="padding:1px 6px">resource::…</i> resource node</span>
    <span><i class="node code" style="padding:1px 6px">module.fn</i> code node</span>
    <span>label reads <code>FLOWS_TO · kind · via</code></span>
  </div>
</div>

### Shape 1 — resource to resource (`kind = resource`)

A value read from one resource reaches a write to another within a function
body. No `via`.

```
Resource(ENV::K) -FLOWS_TO {kind: resource}-> Resource(STDOUT::<dynamic>)
```

`x` is read from `ENV::K`, then passed to `print(x)`, which writes `STDOUT`. Both
endpoints are **resource** nodes. This is the leak/provenance answer: a value
from the environment reached standard output.

### Shape 2 — caller to callee (`kind = arg`)

A tainted local value is passed as an argument into a first-party callee. `via`
names the conduit.

```
Function(leak) -FLOWS_TO {kind: arg, via: arg:0}-> Function(forward)
```

`t` (tainted by `ENV::T`) is passed to `forward(t)` as the 0th positional
argument, so `via = arg:0`. A keyword call such as `forward(v=t)` records
`via = kw:v` instead. Both endpoints are **code** nodes; the edge records taint
crossing a call boundary *into* the callee.

### Shape 3 — callee to caller (`kind = return`, `via = return`)

A callee whose return value is tainted flows that value back to its caller.

```
Function(build) -FLOWS_TO {kind: return, via: return}-> Function(leak)
```

`build()` returns `os.getenv("K")`, and `leak` does `r = build()`, so taint
crosses the call boundary *out of* the callee. `via = return` is simply the
channel name. This edge is emitted both when the returned value is assigned
(`r = build()`) and when it is returned directly (`return build()`).

### Which way the arrow points

The `arg` and `return` edges can look confusing side by side, because they point
in opposite directions even though the caller is the same in both:

```
leak -FLOWS_TO {kind: arg}->    forward     (leak passes t INTO forward)
build -FLOWS_TO {kind: return}-> leak        (build hands a value BACK to leak)
```

Both come from `leak`'s body — `leak` is the **caller** in both. The arrow points
opposite ways because the *value* travels opposite ways across the call
boundary. Picture each function as a box with input slots on the front and one
output chute on the back:

```
   t ──▶│ forward │            │ build │──▶ r
        └─────────┘            └───────┘
   value goes IN               value comes OUT
   caller → callee (arg)       callee → caller (return)
```

`leak` operates both boxes: it **pushes** `t` into `forward`'s input slot
(`leak → forward`), and it **catches** what `build`'s chute produces
(`build → leak`).

Note that the assignment in `r = build()` is *not* what flips the direction. A
return value flows out of the callee regardless; the `r =` only gives that
out-flowing value a name so it can be tracked further downstream (which is how
`print(r)` later completes the `ENV::K → STDOUT` resource flow). The rule is
simply:

> Direction follows the value. **In as an argument → caller → callee (`arg`).
> Out as a return → callee → caller (`return`).**

### Reading an edge

Read any `FLOWS_TO` edge as a sentence:

> a value flowed from **left** to **right**, and it was a `<kind>` flow that
> travelled `<via>`.

Keeping `kind` and `via` as properties on a single relationship type means one
query — `MATCH ()-[:FLOWS_TO]->()` — walks the entire data-flow graph, and you
filter on `r.kind` / `r.via` only when you need the detail.

### `kind` values

`kind` is one of exactly three values:

| `kind` | Endpoints | Meaning | `via` |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| `resource` | `Resource` → `Resource` | A value read from one resource reaches a write to another. | *(none)* |
| `arg` | code → code | A tainted value is passed into a callee as an argument. | `arg:<index>` or `kw:<name>` |
| `return` | code → code | A callee's tainted return value flows back to its caller. | `return` |

"code" endpoints are `Module`, `Function`, or `Method` nodes.

### `via` values

`via` names the exact channel the value crossed. It is present only on `arg` and
`return` edges (a `resource` edge has no `via`):

| `via` | Appears on | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `arg:<index>` | `kind = arg` | Passed as a positional argument; `<index>` is the 0-based position, e.g. `arg:0` for the first argument. |
| `kw:<name>` | `kind = arg` | Passed as a keyword argument; `<name>` is the parameter name, e.g. `kw:token` for `forward(token=t)`. |
| `return` | `kind = return` | Handed back through the callee's `return` statement. |

## Propagation and kill rules

Within a function body, taint moves and disappears by these rules:

- **Copy.** `b = a` copies `a`'s taint (and its origin resource) to `b`.
- **Rebind to a new source.** `x = os.getenv("B")` after `x = os.getenv("A")`
  makes `x` carry `ENV::B`; the discarded `ENV::A` no longer flows from `x`.
- **Kill.** Assigning a tainted variable to something clean removes its taint:
  `x = "safe"` or `x = <untainted variable>` means `x` is no longer tracked, so
  a later `print(x)` produces **no** resource flow. The `READS_FROM` /
  `WRITES_TO` edges for the individual calls are still recorded; only the false
  data-flow edge is suppressed.
- **Co-occurrence is not flow.** An unrelated read sitting next to an untainted
  call produces no `FLOWS_TO` edge. Reading `ENV::K` in the same function that
  calls `helper(u)` with an untainted `u` does not connect the two.

### How a chain is resolved (the forward pass)

A multi-hop chain like `a = getenv(...); b = a; c = b; print(c)` might look as if
it needs a backward search from the sink (`print`) down through `c → b → a` to
the source. It does not. The analyser makes a **single forward pass**, top to
bottom, carrying one live table:

> `tainted` = { variable name → the **origin resource** it currently carries }

The table's value is the *origin resource*, not a pointer to the previous
variable, so each assignment copies the origin forward:

```
a = os.getenv("K")   # getenv is a source     → tainted = { a: ENV::K }
b = a                # 'a' is tainted, copy it → tainted = { a: ENV::K, b: ENV::K }
c = b                # 'b' is tainted, copy it → tainted = { a: ENV::K, b: ENV::K, c: ENV::K }
print(c)             # sink; look up 'c' → ENV::K → emit  ENV::K → STDOUT
```

By the time the sink is reached, the origin is already known by an O(1) lookup —
there is no sink-to-source traversal. The intermediate variables `a`, `b`, `c`
are **not** graph nodes; they exist only in this table, and the chain collapses
to a single edge between the two resource endpoints it connects.

Because the origin rides forward at every `=`, chain length is irrelevant — one
hop or fifty, it is still one sweep and one edge. And if any hop is overwritten
with something clean, that variable drops out of the table (the **kill** rule
above), so the sink finds nothing and no edge is drawn.

## Scope attribution

Each function, method, and nested definition is analysed as its own unit. A
read, write, or flow is attributed to the **immediate** scope that contains it,
never to an enclosing scope. In particular a value tainted inside a nested
function does not leak into the outer function's flow, and the outer function's
own reads and writes are unaffected.

## Opt-in and endpoints

`FLOWS_TO` and its `Resource` endpoints are only produced when the `io` capture
group is enabled. When enabled, the resource endpoints of a `FLOWS_TO` edge are
always ensured as nodes first, so an edge never dangles to a missing node — even
if `READS_FROM` / `WRITES_TO` themselves are filtered out by a narrower capture
selection.

## Example queries

Once a graph is built with the `io` capture group, these Cypher queries answer
the provenance questions the edges are designed for:

```cypher
// Every value that flows from an environment variable to standard output.
MATCH (a:Resource)-[r:FLOWS_TO {kind: 'resource'}]->(b:Resource)
WHERE a.kind = 'ENV' AND b.kind = 'STDOUT'
RETURN a.qualified_name, b.qualified_name;

// Multi-hop reachability: does any source reach any sink across calls?
MATCH p = (src:Resource)-[:FLOWS_TO*1..8]->(dst:Resource)
RETURN p;

// Which callables read a given resource directly.
MATCH (fn)-[:READS_FROM]->(r:Resource {qualified_name: 'resource::ENV::K'})
RETURN fn.qualified_name;
```

## Cross-scope handle resolution

A resource handle bound in one scope and used in another is resolved against the
scope that constructed it, so the I/O is credited to the scope that runs it:

- **Instance attributes.** `self.conn = sqlite3.connect(...)` in `__init__` (or any
  method) is visible to every other method, so `self.conn.execute(...)` in a
  different method emits the DATABASE edge on *that* method.
- **Enclosing locals.** A module-level or outer-function `conn = sqlite3.connect(...)`
  is visible to nested functions that use it. A same-named local rebind shadows the
  inherited handle.

## Re-exported modules

Source and handle detection matches the canonical dotted callee even when the
module is re-exported under its own name. A project that does
`from .utils import sqlite3` (a common stdlib/`pysqlite3` shim) still has its
`sqlite3.connect(...)` recognised as a DATABASE handle.

## Scope of the current phase

`FLOWS_TO` is intentionally conservative in this phase:

- Value flow inside a function body is tracked by an intra-procedural walk. A callee
  returning **different** sources on different branches carries every origin to its
  callers. It is not path-sensitive: a kill on one branch of an `if`/`else` drops
  taint conservatively.
- Return taint composes **transitively across functions and files**. Per-function
  summaries are resolved by a worklist fixpoint once every file has been walked, so
  a callee defined after (or in a different file from) its caller is still known to
  return a tainted value at the caller's site.
- Forward argument taint composes into callee **sinks** for Python and the lean-walk
  languages with a parameter-name extractor (Go, JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, C++): a
  parameter that reaches a write sink inside its body is recorded as a per-function
  parameter-sink summary (closed over transitive parameter hand-offs by the same
  finalize fixpoint), so a tainted argument passed at a call site emits the full
  `resource -> resource` flow even when the source and the sink live in different
  bodies — the logging-wrapper case `secret = getenv('K'); log_it(secret)` with
  `log_it(m): logger.info(m)` connects ENV to STDOUT. Only resolved callees participate;
  there are still no `Parameter` nodes and no SSA-level precision. Java and C# parse
  into the graph but have no parameter-name extractor yet, so their positional
  composition stays inert until one is added.
- Forward argument taint also composes through a callee's **return** value for Python
  (pass-through helpers such as `def redact(v): return v`): a parameter that reaches the
  function's return — directly or transitively through `return other(p)` and pass-through
  chains — is closed over by the same finalize fixpoint, and a call site passing a tainted
  argument into such a parameter folds that argument's origins into the callee's return
  summary, so a caller consuming the return (`y = redact(secret); print(y)`) resolves the
  secret to the sink. This return composition is Python-only; the lean walks forward
  taint into callee sinks (above) but not yet through a callee's return.
- The `kind = arg` edge itself is still recorded one level deep — it marks that a
  tainted value reached a call — and is emitted alongside the forward composition above.
  Sources and sinks are direct I/O calls from the registry.
- The source/sink registry covers Python, JavaScript, TypeScript (including TSX),
  Go, Java, Rust, C, C++, C#, and Lua; a language not in the registry emits no I/O
  or flow edges until its table is added.
- The lean (non-Python) `FLOWS_TO` walk matches **direct call sinks only**; a taint
  that reaches a resource through a handle method (`os.Create(p).Write(x)`,
  `io.open(p):write(x)`, `File::create(p).write(x)`) emits no flow edge, uniformly
  across every lean language — the handle-tracking tables feed the `READS_FROM`/
  `WRITES_TO` walk, not the flow walk. So a handle-only write leak reads as `NO_FLOW`
  rather than `UNKNOWN` in a fully covered project; teaching the flow walk to track
  handle bindings (cross-language) is tracked in #1204. This bites Lua hardest, since Lua has
  no direct file-write sink at all.

These are deliberate ceilings, chosen so the feature is correct and cheap where
it applies rather than broad and noisy.

## Language coverage

`FLOWS_TO` covers **11 of the 14 supported languages** — every language whose
source/sink table is registered in `FLOW_REGISTERED_LANGUAGES`
(`codebase_rag/parsers/io_access/registry.py`). Python uses the deep,
path-sensitive walk; the rest use the descriptor-driven lean walk. A language
outside this set is still parsed into the graph — it simply emits no `FLOWS_TO`
edges, so a reachability question over it returns `UNKNOWN` rather than
`NO_FLOW` (see the three-verdict query below).

| Language | `FLOWS_TO` | Walk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | ✅ | deep, path-sensitive |
| JavaScript | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| TypeScript | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| TSX | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| Go | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| Java | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| Rust | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| C++ | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| C | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| C# | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| Lua | ✅ | lean descriptor |
| PHP | ❌ | not covered — no sink table |
| Scala | ❌ | not covered — no sink table |
| Dart | ❌ | not covered — no sink table |

## Coverage metadata and the three-verdict query

An empty flow result is ambiguous on its own: "no flow exists" and "the flow
sits outside what the analysis covers" look identical, and for assurance
questions an absent path must never be read as a pass. Two mechanisms make
the distinction queryable:

- Every file-backed `Module` node carries a `flow_covered` boolean: `true`
  when the module's language is in the source/sink registry **and** the
  `FLOWS_TO` capture group was enabled at indexing time. A bodied inline
  `mod` stamps the same value as its file; inline Module nodes that keep a
  synthetic `inline_module_*` path have no independent coverage and are
  excluded from gap reporting rather than counted as gaps. Directly
  queryable in Cypher.
- A source-to-sink reachability question, exposed as the `flow_verdict` MCP
  tool, answers with one of three verdicts:
    - `FOUND` — a `FLOWS_TO` path exists; the qualified-name path is
      returned.
    - `NO_FLOW` — no path, and every module of the project was inside
      analysed coverage.
    - `UNKNOWN` — no path was found, but part of the project sits outside
      coverage; the uncovered files are named.

The coverage read is deliberately project-wide rather than restricted to the
query's reachable surface: without path sensitivity, a flow through an
uncovered file cannot be ruled out from the covered part of the graph, so
narrowing the check would manufacture false `NO_FLOW` verdicts. Reachability
itself runs client-side over a linear scan of the project's `FLOWS_TO`
edges, the same discipline as dead-code detection.
