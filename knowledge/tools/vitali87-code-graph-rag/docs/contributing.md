# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Code-Graph-RAG!

!!! note "Canonical guide"
    This page is a quick-start summary. The full, authoritative contribution guide, including the complete coding standards, lives in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) at the repository root. When the two differ, the root guide wins.

## Getting Started

1. **Browse Issues**: Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag/issues) to find tasks that need work. Look for `good first issue` and `help wanted` labels.
2. **Pick an Issue**: Choose an issue that interests you and matches your skill level
3. **Comment on the Issue**: Let us know you're working on it to avoid duplicate effort
4. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own fork to work on
5. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name like `feat/add-feature` or `fix/bug-description`

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/code-graph-rag.git
cd code-graph-rag
make dev
```

This installs all dependencies and sets up pre-commit hooks automatically.

## Pre-commit Hooks

All commits must pass pre-commit checks. Do not skip hooks with `--no-verify`.

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
```

## Running Checks Locally

```bash
make lint          # Lint check
make format        # Apply formatting (ruff format writes files; CI uses ruff format --check)
make typecheck     # Type check
make test-parallel # Unit tests in parallel
make test-integration  # Integration tests (requires Docker)
```

Or run everything at once:

```bash
make check      # Runs lint + typecheck + test
make pre-commit # Runs ALL pre-commit checks (mirrors CI)
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single issue or feature
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages using Conventional Commits format
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation when necessary
- Be responsive to feedback during code review

### CI Pipeline

All pull requests are validated by CI, which runs in parallel:

1. **Lint & Format**: `ruff check` and `ruff format --check`
2. **Type Check**: `ty check` on production code
3. **Unit Tests**: Parallel execution with `pytest-xdist` and coverage reporting
4. **Integration Tests**: Full stack testing with Memgraph
5. **PR Title Validation**: Conventional Commits format check

### Automated Code Review

This project uses automated code review bots (**Greptile** and **Gemini Code Assist**). Before requesting a human review, address all bot comments by either implementing suggestions or replying with a clear justification for why a suggestion doesn't apply.

## Technical Requirements

- **PydanticAI for now**: The current framework choice, open to a well-argued change. Do not add a second one (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) in a feature PR; open an issue first
- **External services**: Integrations use free tiers only, resolve their backend from configuration rather than hard-coding one vendor, and default to a keyless provider where one exists. Paid capability belongs in [Enterprise Services](https://code-graph-rag.com/enterprise). Contributors integrating a service they are compensated by disclose that in the PR description. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/vitali87/code-graph-rag/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full terms
- **Heavy Pydantic Usage**: Use Pydantic models for data validation, serialisation, and configuration
- **Package Management**: Use `uv` for all dependency management
- **Code Quality**: Use `ruff` for linting and formatting
- **Type Safety**: Use type hints everywhere and run `uv run ty check`

## Development Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `uv` | Package manager and dependency resolver |
| `ruff` | Code linting and formatting |
| `ty` | Static type checking (from Astral) |
| `pytest` | Testing framework |
| `ripgrep` (`rg`) | Shell command text searching |

## Comment Policy

Write comments that explain why and how, not what. A comment that only restates the adjacent code adds no value.
