"""soup mcp - Model Context Protocol server (v0.71.28).

``soup mcp serve`` exposes Soup's read-only commands (plus two plan-only
mutating tools) to any MCP client (Claude Code / Cursor / Cline / Continue)
over stdio. The heavy ``mcp`` SDK is behind the ``[mcp]`` extra and imported
lazily, so this command errors friendly-ly when the extra is missing.

All user-facing help text stays ASCII (Windows terminal / cp1252 safety;
mirrors the ``test_help_output_is_ascii_safe`` guard).
