#
# The v0.25.0 scorer was ``answer.lower() in output.lower()`` — a raw substring
# test that credited "B" for "**B**erlin"/"**b**ecause", "ok" for "lo**ok**",
# and "3" for "1**3**". That made the whole leg-2 regression gate decorative.
# The fix is answer-EXTRACTION (pull the model's chosen option) + a
# boundary-aware match, so a spurious substring no longer scores.

# MCQ option letters run A–J (the bundled suites never exceed 5 options today,
# but the extractor is generous so richer suites drop in without a scorer edit).
_MCQ_OPTIONS = "ABCDEFGHIJ"

# Cap the model output the scorer regexes scan (defense-in-depth — the regexes
# are all O(n) with bounded quantifiers, but ``score_answer`` is public SDK
# surface callable with an arbitrary, unbounded ``generate_fn``).

# optional ``is`` lets the letter sit one filler word past the cue.

# LaTeX ``\boxed{C}`` — how a reasoning-tuned model states its final answer.
# Mirrors ``trainer/rewards._extract_answer``'s boxed regex, but this is an
# OPTION-LETTER tier and deliberately narrower: it fires only when the box holds
# a single A–J letter. ``\boxed{4}`` is the model answering with a VALUE, and
# reading that as "option 4" would be a wrong credit rather than a repair — the
# prompt is what has to change there (see ``_MCQ_ANSWER_CUE``). #357.
# The ``\s*`` after ``\boxed`` matters: LaTeX permits whitespace between the
# command and its brace and models emit it (``\boxed {A}``), so without it the
# spaced spelling scores zero — the same #357 defect, one space to the left.
_BOXED_LETTER_RE = re.compile(r"\\boxed\s*\{\s*([A-Ja-j])\s*\}")

# end-of-string or sentence punctuation, not by more words. Requiring upper-case
# skips the lower-case article "a"/"an", and the terminating look-ahead skips a
# capitalized sentence-opener like "A cat sat ..." / the pronoun "I think ..."
# that a bare "\b" match would wrongly read as choosing option A / I.

# The other half of the boxed-answer defect, and the half the extractor CANNOT
# fix. Measured on Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct over the shipped ``mini_mmlu``:
# of 15 failures, 8 boxed the right LETTER (the extractor's half) and **6 boxed
# a VALUE** — "\\boxed{4}" for "What is 2 + 2? (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5" — because
# nothing in the prompt ever asked for a letter. Teaching the extractor to read
# a boxed value as an option would credit the wrong thing; asking for the letter
# is the honest repair. Neither change alone closes the issue: the extractor
# alone is worth +8 items, the prompt alone **0**, together 0.423 -> 0.731.
#
# It is appended only to items whose ANSWER is an option letter, so the
# free-text suites (``mini_instruction``, ``mini_arithmetic``) are untouched.
# Base and tuned models receive the identical prompt, so every existing delta
# stays comparable — only the absolute level moves.
