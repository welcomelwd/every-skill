"""v0.71.36 — Secret-Sharer canaries (Data Moat II).

Insert K high-entropy secrets into a dataset, then later measure whether a
model memorized them by comparing each secret's loss against N
never-inserted CONTROLS drawn from the identical space and sharing the
carrier prompt (Carlini et al., "The Secret Sharer").

Why loss-vs-controls and not greedy regurgitation: a model can memorize a
canary and still not emit it under greedy decoding, so "nothing came back"
would be false reassurance — the precise failure a leak-detection feature
must not have.

PURE — no torch, no model. The caller supplies the losses (from
:func:`soup_cli.utils.live_eval.compute_pair_losses`), so the entire
decision is testable on CPU with hand-written numbers.

    ~Uniform(0,1), so P(percentile <= 0.01) = 0.01 PER CANARY — but with K
    canaries the chance that at least one dips below is 1 - 0.99^K. At the

    MAJOR on a perfectly clean model roughly one run in seven — and MAJOR

    untrained model produced percentiles spanning 1.6%-93%, with two under
    10%, purely from noise.
