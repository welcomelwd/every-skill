"""Adversarial verifier probe — `soup reward stress` (v0.71.41).

Turn the v0.71.26 reward-hacking expertise on a reward VERIFIER itself: does it
pay out for degenerate completions (empty / length-padded / repetition /
sentinel-spam)? A correct deterministic verifier rejects all of them.

Pure, offline, NO top-level torch. Reuses the attack-kind vocabulary of
``reward_hack_control`` (``SHAPING_KINDS`` = length/repetition/sentinel) — as
ATTACKS rather than mitigations — plus the trivial ``empty`` case. Companion to
``reward_synth`` (v0.71.40): ``synth`` proves a verifier separates references
from *friendly* perturbations; ``stress`` asks the *adversarial* question a
reward-hacking model asks at train time.
