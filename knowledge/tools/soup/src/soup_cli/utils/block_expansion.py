"""LLaMA Pro block expansion — schema in v0.41.0 Part C, live wiring v0.53.4 #83.

LLaMA Pro (`https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02415`) adds ``N`` zero-initialised
transformer blocks to a base model and freezes the original blocks, training
only the new blocks. The result is a copy-and-extend that preserves base
behaviour while adding capacity in the new domain.

v0.41.0 Part C shipped the schema fields + a ``NotImplementedError`` stub.
v0.53.4 #83 lifts the stub with a real implementation:

1. Clone the last ``num_new_blocks`` decoder blocks via ``copy.deepcopy``.
2. Zero-init the MLP output projection ("down_proj") of each clone so the
   block initially acts as an identity (per the LLaMA Pro paper §3.1).
3. Append the clones to ``model.model.layers`` (HF causal-LM convention).
4. Update ``model.config.num_hidden_layers`` so cached counts stay coherent.

The new-block-only freeze policy is owned by the caller via
``freeze_trainable_layers`` (positive = train top-N, negative = train
bottom-N); ``apply_llama_pro_freeze`` is provided for the canonical
"train only the appended blocks" case.

References:
- LlamaFactory ``freeze_trainable_layers`` (positive = train top-N, negative
  = train bottom-N) + ``expand_layers`` (block count).
