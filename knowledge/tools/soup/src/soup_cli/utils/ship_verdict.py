"""SHIP / DON'T-SHIP verdict engine — `soup ship` (v0.71.25).

After fine-tuning, answer ONE question: did the model get better, or did I
break it? The output is a binary **SHIP / DON'T SHIP** plus a one-screen
reason — not a dashboard to guess from.

The decision fuses two legs into a single verdict::

    SHIP  <=>  (leg 1: task_tuned  >  task_base   — STRICT inequality)
          AND  (leg 2: for every benchmark:  base - tuned  <=  forgetting_threshold)
    else DON'T SHIP — even if the task metric looks great.

The moat is **leg 2 (catastrophic-forgetting / regression gate) as a
first-class co-equal of leg 1**, fused into one decision. The regression delta
math reuses the project's existing semantics (``eval/gate.py::run_gate`` and
``eval/leaderboard.compare_runs``): ``delta = tuned - base``; a benchmark
regresses when its *drop* (``base - tuned``) exceeds ``forgetting_threshold``
(absolute points, same meaning as ``EvalGateConfig.regression_threshold``).

This module is **pure-python (NO top-level torch)** so the whole truth table is
CPU-testable. Model loading + live evaluation live in ``commands/ship.py``.
