  - Friendlier error messages — richer CUDA-OOM hint + Hugging Face gated-repo and `trust_remote_code` mappings + tests ([#282](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/282))
- **Darsh** ([@CODING-DARSH](https://github.com/CODING-DARSH))
  - Harden judge-URL validation against hostname prefix bypass (`startswith` → `urlparse`) in `eval/gate.py` ([#288](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/288))
  - Apply configured vocabulary expansion (`data.add_new_tokens` / `new_special_tokens`) during SFT trainer init ([#287](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/287))
  - Reuse the shared vocab-expansion helper in the vision + audio SFT paths ([#291](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/291))
  - Honor configured vocab expansion in the DPO / IPO / KTO / BCO trainers ([#293](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/293))
  - Honor configured vocab expansion in the ORPO / SimPO / GRPO trainers ([#295](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/295))
  - `soup mcp serve --allow-execute` — the execution gate, kept a separate and stronger opt-in than `--allow-mutating`, with the tools still plan-only in this slice ([#391](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/391))
  - Gated `train_execute` / `export_execute` behind a single-use server confirmation token, with the config snapshotted at plan time and protected directories digested by content rather than by mtime ([#393](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/393))
- **Ekaanksh Patil** ([@Ekaanksh-dev](https://github.com/Ekaanksh-dev))
  - Batch the PRM reward forward pass in `PRMScorer.__call__` (single `[B, T]` forward) ([#301](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/301))
- **Sanjay Santhanam** ([@Sanjays2402](https://github.com/Sanjays2402))
  - Run built-in benchmark gate tasks through `ForgettingDetector` — every `type: benchmark` eval-gate task had always failed ([#315](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/315))
- **Nicolás Ramos** ([@nicolasramos](https://github.com/nicolasramos))
  - `backend: mlx` was never dispatched — every MLX run trained through the transformers wrapper instead, and the saved MLX "adapter" was a full fine-tune because the model was never frozen before LoRA ([#362](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/362))
- **William Yang** ([@wilyan09007](https://github.com/wilyan09007))
  - `training.seed` reached the SFT wrapper and nothing else — seventeen other task wrappers trained at HF's default 42 with no error, so replicates that differed only in the seed were the same run; the seed is now applied before the adapter is drawn, not only inside `Trainer` ([#381](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/381))
  - Under `use_fsdp2_compile`, every `checkpoint-*` kept `torch.compile`'s key prefix and resumed **silently** from a re-zeroed adapter — normalisation now runs as each checkpoint is written, ahead of anything that publishes it ([#380](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/380))
- **Amir Fathi** ([@AmirF194](https://github.com/AmirF194))
  - A streamed model's `named_parameters()` carried the wrapper's `.inner.` segment, so a name-keyed comparison against a resident model shared no names at all and a correctness gate reported `0/0` as a pass ([#384](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/384))
  - `training.stream_vram_override` — the layer-streaming pre-flight measured free VRAM with a device-level driver query, so it could not see a per-process cap and there was no way to make it simulate one ([#386](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/386))
  - The VRAM pre-flight never called its own calibration hook, so the guard against a stack whose loss path under-budgets by 12.5% sat inert with no caller ([#390](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/390))
  - `kl_control` re-wrote the same β on every hold step, so a non-acting run was not the no-op `log_only` claims to be; the mitigation log now carries `held` / `acted` / `released` as a field rather than as free text ([#414](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/414))
- **Ben Younes** ([@ousamabenyounes](https://github.com/ousamabenyounes))
  - `MitigationLogWriter` dropped every record in silence once its parent directory vanished mid-run — the controller kept acting while its evidence stopped growing ([#398](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/398))
  - `soup draft distill --steps N` delivered only ~N/4.44 optimiser steps — `val_split` and `gradient_accumulation_steps` both divide the budget, and the epoch arithmetic ignored them ([#399](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/399))
  - The `soup ship` MCQ scorer read `oxed {A}` as no-answer — LaTeX permits a space before the brace and models emit it, and the cue tier cannot rescue it ([#396](https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Soup/pull/396))
