## Seeds & reproducibility (`training.seed`)

Two knobs, both unset by default:

```yaml
training:
  seed: 1234        # weight init of new params, data order, dropout
  data_seed: 99     # optional — data order ONLY, so init stays fixed
```

`seed` reaches `TrainingArguments.seed` (which `Trainer.__init__` hands to
`transformers.set_seed`, covering `random`, `numpy` and `torch`) and the
multipack FFD sampler. `data_seed` reaches `TrainingArguments.data_seed`; set it
alongside `seed` to vary only the order rows are seen in while holding
initialisation fixed.

**Why you want this.** Without a seed knob every run of a config took the same
default, so "run it again with a different seed" was impossible: replicates of
one arm differed only by row permutation and GPU nondeterminism. That understates
run-to-run spread, and spread is the yardstick a real between-arm difference has
to beat. Three replicates at three seeds is the cheapest honest error bar you can
put on a training change:

```bash
for s in 1 2 3; do
  soup train --config soup.yaml --output "runs/seed-$s" \
    && echo "seed $s done"   # set training.seed: $s in the config per run
done
```

**"Unset" does not mean the same thing for both fields.** An unset `seed`
resolves to 42, HuggingFace's own `TrainingArguments` default. An unset
`data_seed` stays `None`, which HF reads as "follow `seed`" rather than as a
seed of its own, so leaving it out is not the same kind of default as leaving
`seed` out. The multipack sampler still gets `0`, the value it has had since
v0.37.0. The fields are `Optional[int]` rather than defaulting to 42 precisely
so the trainer can tell "unset" from "explicitly 42" and keep those different
historical defaults intact.

**What changes for a run that sets neither field.** The values it trains at are
the same as before: seed 42, `data_seed` at `None`. What is new is *when* the
seed arrives. Before #353 nothing called `set_seed` ahead of `get_peft_model`,
so `lora_A` and any freshly initialised classification head were drawn from
torch's default generator, which is seeded from entropy once per process. An
unseeded run's initialisation therefore varied from one process to the next, and
it is now deterministic at 42. If you were getting replicate spread out of runs
that set no seed, that is where it was coming from: those runs are identical to
each other now, and varying a replicate means setting `training.seed` on
purpose.

Bounds: `[0, 2**32 - 1]` (`set_seed` feeds `numpy.random.seed`, which rejects
anything outside that range), `0` is a legitimate seed, and a YAML `true` is
rejected rather than silently becoming seed 1. `data_seed` is forwarded to
Accelerate's dataloader configuration and needs `accelerate >= 1.1.0`;
below that, transformers warns and ignores it (`seed` is unaffected).

**Scope.** Every task wrapper threads both fields into the `TrainingArguments`
subclass it builds, and applies `seed` before it loads the model, so the LoRA
adapter and any freshly initialised head are drawn at the configured seed rather
than at whatever the process happened to be sitting on (#353). `unlearn` builds
no `Trainer` at all, and its RMU control vector follows `training.seed` too,
staying at 0 when the seed is unset. The `pretrain` and layer-streaming paths
pick `seed` up for their samplers as well.

Through v0.73.0 this reached the **SFT** trainer only, so `training.seed: 7` on
a DPO or GRPO run was accepted and silently trained at 42.

The one path that still ignores both fields is the **MLX backend**
(`backend: mlx`), whose trainers seed nothing at all — MLX has its own RNG
(`mx.random`). Setting either field there now prints a warning naming it
(`MLX backend ignores: training.seed ...`) rather than accepting it in silence,
so an MLX run cannot look seeded while it is not.

**Not a determinism guarantee.** A fixed seed makes the *software* RNG
reproducible. It does not make CUDA kernels bit-reproducible — non-deterministic
atomics, autotuned algorithms and a different GPU or library version can still
move the last digits. For bit-exact reruns you also need
`torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`, which Soup does not set for you.

## Full fine-tuning (`lora.r: 0`)

Train every parameter, no adapter:

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: sft
training:
  quantization: none    # full-FT trains float weights
  lora:
    r: 0                # <- no adapter; the base itself trains
```

`lora.r: 0` is the supported spelling for plain full fine-tuning. It is the one
`soup`'s classifier trainer has read as "no adapter" since v0.71.12, and the one
`soup card` already resolves to a dense model rather than an adapter — so the
model card, the registry entry and the trainer all agree without extra flags. On
a rank of 0 the SFT trainer skips `get_peft_model` entirely: `soup train` prints
`Full fine-tuning: N parameter tensor(s) trainable (lora.r=0, no adapter)`
instead of `LoRA applied`, and the output directory holds a complete model, not
an adapter to merge.

Requirements, each rejected at config load with the reason named:
`task: sft`, `backend: transformers`, `modality: text`, and
`quantization: none` (quantized weights cannot be trained directly — use LoRA
on top of them, i.e. QLoRA). It is mutually exclusive with every LoRA feature
(`use_dora` / `use_vera` / `use_olora` / `use_rslora` / `rank_pattern` /
`alpha_pattern` / `init_strategy` / `moe_lora` / `use_longlora` /
`relora_steps` / `loraplus_lr_ratio`) — a LoRA knob next to `r: 0` is a
contradiction rather than something to silently ignore — and with the other two
"LoRA off" modes, [Spectrum](#spectrum--targeted-training-on-layer-snr-soup-spectrum-scan-v07123)
(`unfrozen_parameters`) and LISA (`lisa_enabled`), since each independently
decides what trains. It cannot be combined with layer streaming: streaming keeps
the decoder on the meta device and trains only the adapter, so there would be
nothing to full fine-tune.

`freeze_layers` / `freeze_ratio` **do** stay legal with `r: 0` — "train
everything above layer N" is a real technique — and the trainer respects
whatever they froze instead of silently unfreezing it. If they leave nothing
trainable the run is refused rather than burning GPU-hours on a no-op.

Pick between the three "LoRA off" modes by how much you want to train:

| Spelling | Trains | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lora.r: 0` | everything | you have the VRAM and want the strongest baseline |
| `unfrozen_parameters` ([Spectrum](#spectrum--targeted-training-on-layer-snr-soup-spectrum-scan-v07123)) | a hand-picked / SNR-ranked set | you want full-FT quality on the layers that matter |
| `lisa_enabled` (LISA) | a rotating random subset | you want full-FT quality at LoRA-like memory |

> Full fine-tuning needs far more memory than LoRA: optimizer state alone is
> ~8 bytes per parameter for AdamW. `batch_size: "auto"` estimates memory from
> a LoRA-shaped model, so on a full-FT run it errs optimistic — set
> `batch_size` explicitly, or start low and raise it. (This is not new to
> `r: 0`; the same is true of the Spectrum and LISA full-FT paths.)

---

## Continual-learning rehearsal (`--replay`)

Fine-tuning on a new task can erase the old one. Rehearsal is the standard
defence: mix a slice of the old data back in.

```bash
soup train --config new_task.yaml --replay old_task.jsonl --replay-ratio 0.1
```

or in `soup.yaml`:

```yaml
data:
  train: new_task.jsonl
  replay: old_task.jsonl
  replay_ratio: 0.1      # fraction of the FINAL mixed set
  replay_seed: 0
```

**The ratio is a share of the final set**, not of the new data:
`n_replay = round(r/(1-r) · n_new)`. At `0.1` over 1000 new rows that is 111
replay rows → 1111 total → exactly 10%. The console reports what it did:

```
Replay: +26 old rows interleaved (30.2% of 86)
```

Three guarantees worth knowing:

- **Interleaved, never appended.** A trailing block of old rows would mean the
  model sees them all in the final steps — a second mini-finetune, which is the
  failure rehearsal exists to prevent.
- **`train` only; validation stays pure new-task**, so your eval still measures
  the task you are learning. Measure old-task retention separately with
  `soup eval custom` / `soup ship`.
- **An undersized pool reports a shortfall rather than repeating rows** — a row
  seen twice per epoch is a different experiment.

The replay file gets its own format detection, so the old set may be alpaca while
the new one is sharegpt.

**Scope (v1):** `sft` and `pretrain` only, and incompatible with
`packing`/`multipack` — those concatenate rows into fixed blocks, so the ratio
stops being meaningful at block boundaries. Both are rejected with a clear error
rather than silently mis-mixing.

**Honest result.** Validated at proof-of-mechanism scale (SmolLM2-135M + LoRA):
training task B from a model that knew task A, replay retained A **7% better than
a no-replay control** (loss 0.565 → 0.526) at a ~5% cost to task B — the expected
trade. But forgetting without replay was only **+4%**, i.e. mild: LoRA on a 135M
model barely drifts. The direction and the mechanism are proven; the effect size
at full fine-tuning or 7B+ is unproven on a 4 GB box.

## Loop Hardening

Six surfaces protect the training loop from the failure modes that cost a real GPU-hour. The schema + math kernels shipped in v0.70.0; the live trainer-callback wiring shipped in **v0.71.11**, validated end-to-end on SmolLM2-135M.

```bash

    --echo-trap-enabled \
    --echo-trap-threshold 0.6 \
    --echo-trap-halt \
    --echo-trap-tokenizer-aware
```

`--echo-trap-tokenizer-aware` switches echo-trap n-grams from whitespace tokens to the active tokenizer's integer ids. This catches subword repetition that punctuation-heavy decoded text can hide, but the score becomes tokenizer-specific rather than vocabulary-agnostic.

### Closed-loop reward-hacking auto-mitigation (v0.71.26)

The detectors above *halt*; `training.reward_hack_mitigation` (or the `--reward-hack-mitigation` flag) makes the trainer *self-correct* mid-run. It requires `reward_hack_detector` on a `grpo`/`ppo` transformers run, and has four modes:

- **`log_only`** — observe only. Appends a per-step `mitigation_log.jsonl` under the run's output dir (the InfoRM/ensemble drop, the OK/WARN/HACK verdict, reward mean/std, completion-length trend, repetition) and provably never mutates β. Run this first to *see* hacking before you let a controller act on it.
- **`kl_control`** — a reversible **bang-bang + hysteresis** controller. When a multi-signal vote (`reward_hack_signals`: the detector drop + `length_trend` + `repetition`) stays above `reward_hack_trip_band` for `reward_hack_dwell_steps`, it multiplies β by `reward_hack_kl_gain` (clamped to `[reward_hack_beta_floor > 0, reward_hack_beta_ceil]`, never crossing 0); after `reward_hack_release_patience` below-band steps it relaxes β back toward the floor. Dwell + release-patience stop it flapping. β is written to **both** `trainer.beta` and `trainer.args.beta` so it takes effect on stock GRPO *and* Soup's GRPO variants (and `trainer.args.kl_coef` on PPO).
- **`pid_lagrangian`** — a **PID-Lagrangian** controller (Stooke et al. 2020) that holds the hacking signal at `reward_hack_signal_target` (Kp/Ki/Kd with integral anti-windup via `reward_hack_integral_clamp`), plus an **escalation ladder**: raise β → after `reward_hack_rollback_patience` persistent-HACK steps roll back to the last-good RL checkpoint (needs `rl_checkpoint_save_every_steps`) → after `reward_hack_max_recovery_attempts` rollbacks, early-stop with a plain-English give-up explanation.
- **Anti-gaming hardening** (any control mode): `reward_hack_signal_smoothing` (`ema`/`median` over `reward_hack_smoothing_window`), `reward_hack_conservative_on_disagreement` (when detectors disagree, keep KL high + guard against a bimodal reward-distribution collapse), and `reward_hack_reward_shaping` (subtract a bounded `reward_hack_shaping_strength` penalty on the gamed proxy — `length`/`repetition`/`sentinel` — over the reward-fn seam).

**Scope:** proof-of-mechanism only. Validated on SmolLM2-135M + a synthetic length-hacking task on a single RTX 3050 (all four modes live, including a real mid-run rollback). PPO ships **BETA** — the buffer + `kl_coef` mutation are wired and unit-tested, but the on-GPU proof is GRPO-only. Whether the loop suppresses hacking without collapsing true reward on 7B+ with a real reward model is an open, community-validatable question. `reward_hack_mitigation ∈ {kl_control, pid_lagrangian}` is mutually exclusive with `ref_model_ema_alpha` (both drive the KL/ref dynamics).

Every detector composes with v0.34 `soup why` (anomaly explainer), v0.32 spike recovery, and the v0.53.11 #127 `GRPOStabilityCallback` so a single GRPO run can have InfoRM + echo-trap + spike-recovery + in-place ref-model EMA all active simultaneously without duplicating trajectory / state collection. The reward-hack and echo-trap callbacks read the per-step rewards through a shared, thread-safe capture buffer (Soup wraps your reward functions so it never has to monkeypatch TRL); `rm_ensemble` needs ≥2 reward functions to compute a divergence. The MiniLLM teacher-mix is an offline distribution-blend analog of the paper's on-policy teacher-mixed *sampling*, and ULD compares the distributions after clamping teacher ids to the teacher vocab (correct for same-family / extended-vocab pairs; a genuinely different tokenization needs a sequence-alignment step). The reference-model EMA (`--ref-model-ema-alpha`) updates in place — no full `state_dict` round-trip — so it is cheap at 70B+ scale.


## Unlearning (`task='unlearn'`, NPO / SimNPO / RMU)

GDPR right-to-be-forgotten + CSAM/PII leak response, productized. Three method backends:

- **NPO** — Negative Preference Optimization (DPO-shaped negative-only loss; needs a reference model).
- **SimNPO** — length-normalised NPO without a ref model (faster, more stable on long sequences).
- **RMU** — Representation Misdirection Unlearning (residual-stream noise on forget inputs).

```yaml
# unlearn.yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: unlearn
data:
  train: traces.jsonl
  forget_set: gdpr_deletion_set.jsonl   # rows to unlearn (messages / prompt+completion / text)
  retain_set: capability_anchors.jsonl  # optional — anchors general capability
training:
  unlearn_method: npo           # or simnpo / rmu
  unlearn_alpha: 0.5            # retain-set weighting [0.0, 10.0]
```

```bash
# Run the unlearn loop (validated on SmolLM2-135M — NPO/SimNPO drive forget loss down).
soup train --config unlearn.yaml --yes

# Score the run on TOFU / MUSE / WMDP (OK / MINOR / MAJOR verdict).
soup eval unlearning <run-id> --benchmark tofu --evidence evidence.json --output report.json
```

`task: unlearn` is live (v0.71.9): it loads a LoRA-wrapped policy, a frozen reference copy (NPO / RMU), and the forget / retain JSONL sets, then optimises the per-method loss — NPO's `(2/β)·mean(-logσ(-β·(π_logp − ref_logp)))` drives the policy's forget-set log-prob below the reference (= forgetting), while the retain set anchors capability. Run NPO/SimNPO **with** a `retain_set` — without one the policy has no utility anchor and Soup warns loudly.

Three orthogonal axes: **Forget Quality** (pre/post forget-loss delta), **Model Utility** (retain-accuracy preserved), **PrivLeak** (membership-inference AUC distance from 0.5). Bundled mini-fixtures for all three benchmarks ship in the box (v0.71.1 added MUSE + WMDP alongside the existing TOFU set), so `--benchmark muse|wmdp` runs without supplying evidence. The WMDP forget-set probes ship **redacted** (placeholder prompts + `REFUSED` responses) — Soup never bundles verbatim hazardous-knowledge content.


## Continued Pre-training

Continue training a model on raw text for domain adaptation:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
task: pretrain

data:
  train: ./data/corpus.jsonl   # {"text": "..."} or plain .txt files
  format: plaintext
  max_length: 4096

training:
  epochs: 1
  lr: 1e-5
  quantization: 4bit
```

```bash
soup init --template pretrain
soup train
```


## Knowledge Distillation

Train a small student model to match a larger teacher's output distribution.

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: distill
modality: text
backend: transformers

data:
  train: ./data/chat.jsonl
  max_length: 2048
  chat_template: chatml

training:
  teacher_model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
  distill_divergence: forward_kl   # kl | forward_kl | reverse_kl | js
  distill_temperature: 2.0
  epochs: 3
  lr: 5e-5
  quantization: 4bit               # quantizes student only
```

Loss = student CE + (T**2) × KL(teacher_logits / T  ||  student_logits / T).
Teacher is loaded once, frozen via `requires_grad_(False)` + `.eval()`, and its
inputs / logits are auto-bridged across CPU / CUDA devices.

Set `distill_mode: sequence` (default `token`) to train on the teacher's **generated
continuations** instead of per-token logit matching — a hard-label, cross-tokenizer-friendly
KD that works when student and teacher do not share a vocabulary. `sequence` mode is mutually
exclusive with the cross-tokenizer `uld_strategy` logit path (they are different objectives over
the same task; the trainer rejects the combination at setup). (v0.71.12)


## Sequence Classification

Train a classifier head on top of any base model — supports single-label,
multi-label, and cross-encoder reranking.

```yaml
base: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
task: classifier              # or `reranker`, `cross_encoder`
modality: text
backend: transformers

data:
  train: ./data/labelled.jsonl   # rows: {"text": "...", "label": "spam"} or {"text": "...", "label": [0, 1, 0]}
  max_length: 256

training:
  num_labels: 3
  classifier_kind: single_label   # or `multi_label`
  label_names: [ham, spam, promo] # required when labels are strings
  epochs: 5
  lr: 2e-5
  batch_size: 32
```

Routes `classifier` / `reranker` / `cross_encoder` through
`AutoModelForSequenceClassification`. Multi-label heads cap at 1024 entries per
row, dedup via set conversion, and reject null bytes in label strings.

Add a `lora:` section to train a **frozen encoder + LoRA adapter** classifier instead of the
full model — the small adapter plus the (freshly-initialised) classification head train, the
encoder backbone stays frozen:

```yaml
training:
  num_labels: 3
  lora:
    r: 16
    alpha: 32
```

(v0.71.12)


## Reasoning Effort + EOT Control

gpt-oss-style reasoning-effort control for instruction tuning.

```yaml
training:
  reasoning_effort: high      # low | medium | high
  train_on_eot: true          # do NOT mask the EOT/EOS token in the loss
```

`reasoning_effort` injects `<|reasoning_effort|>high<|/reasoning_effort|>` into
the system turn (creating one if absent). `train_on_eot=True` makes the model
learn when to stop generating by training on the trailing EOS token instead of
masking it out. Both are gated to the SFT-family of tasks.


## EBFT / GDPO Loss Variants

Entropy-regularised SFT (`ebft_variant: structured | strided`) and generalised
DPO (`gdpo_variant: standard | length_normalized | margin`) — both attach
idempotently via `compute_loss` wrappers and auto-fire when the corresponding
variant field is set on `TrainingConfig`.

```yaml
# SFT with EBFT structured
training:
  ebft_variant: structured
  ebft_temperature: 1.0

# DPO with GDPO length_normalized
task: dpo
training:
  gdpo_variant: length_normalized
  dpo_beta: 0.1
```


## GRPO Objective Variants

Soup ships live math kernels for 6 GRPO objective variants in addition to the
default. Set `grpo_variant` in `training` and the trainer automatically
subclasses `trl.GRPOTrainer` to route `compute_loss` through the matching
kernel:

```yaml
task: grpo
training:
  reward_fn: accuracy
  num_generations: 4
  grpo_variant: gspo         # group-stabilised importance ratio
  # or: dapo / dr_grpo / bnpo / rft / two_sided
  # grpo_delta: 0.2          # required when grpo_variant=two_sided
```

Variants:

- **standard** — DeepSeek-R1-style baseline (delegates to TRL's `compute_loss`).
- **gspo** — group-stabilised importance ratio with per-batch control variate.
- **dapo** — decoupled asymmetric clipping (`eps_lo=0.2, eps_hi=0.28`).
- **dr_grpo** — token-sum without per-sample length normalisation.
- **bnpo** — length-normalised PPO surrogate.
- **two_sided** — symmetric clipping with operator-supplied `grpo_delta`.
- **rft** — rejection-sampling fine-tuning (only positive-advantage tokens contribute).

The stability callback (EMA ref-model update, replay buffer, TIS alert counter)
attaches automatically when any of `ref_model_ema_alpha` / `replay_buffer_size`
/ `tis_threshold` / etc. is set.


## Process Reward Model (PRM)

Train a scalar reward head over stepwise-supervised reasoning chains. Data
format is the v0.42.0 `prm` shape — one row per `{prompt, completions: [step1,
step2, ...], labels: [r1, r2, ...]}`:

```yaml
task: prm
data:
  format: prm
  train: ./prm_train.jsonl
  max_length: 2048
training:
  epochs: 1
  lr: 1.0e-5
```

The trainer loads `AutoModelForCausalLM`, attaches an `nn.Linear(hidden, 1)`
reward head, and computes MSE between predicted scalars at step-boundary tokens
and the per-step labels. The reward head is saved inside the model checkpoint
(`reward_head.*` in `model.safetensors`) and the tokenizer is saved alongside it,
so the resulting directory is loadable standalone.


## PRM-guided GRPO (process-supervised RL)

Use a trained PRM as the **per-step reward** inside GRPO — the o1-era
process-supervision signal. Set `training.prm_reward` to a PRM directory (a
`task=prm` checkpoint) or HF id; the PRM splits each generated completion into
reasoning steps (newline heuristic), scores every step with its reward head, and
folds the per-step scores into one scalar reward that GRPO optimises. It
**replaces** `reward_fn` and rides the existing reward-shaping +
reward-hack-mitigation seam, so the v0.71.26 controller still observes it (TRL
logs it as `rewards/prm_reward`).

```yaml
task: grpo
backend: transformers        # required (the PRM reward runs a transformers forward)
modality: text               # required
data:
  format: chatml
  train: ./grpo_prompts.jsonl
training:
  prm_reward: ./my-prm       # a `soup train task=prm` checkpoint dir (or HF id)
  prm_aggregate: min         # weakest-link (default) | prod | last
  num_generations: 4
  grpo_beta: 0.04
```

`prm_aggregate='min'` (weakest-link, the standard PRM aggregation) is the safe
default; `prod` assumes calibrated `[0,1]` step scores (Soup's PRM head is
trained with unconstrained MSE, so `prod` can blow up on uncalibrated labels).

**Bundled rollout environments.** Three deterministic pure-Python toy
environments seed the openenv rollout path out-of-the-box — pair any of them
with `rollout_backend=openenv`:

```yaml
training:
  rollout_backend: openenv
  rollout_func: soup_cli.envs.calculator:rollout   # or retrieval_qa / guess_number
  reward_fn: verifiable
  verifiable_domain: math
```

Ready-made recipes: `grpo-env-calculator`, `grpo-env-retrieval-qa`,
`grpo-env-guess-number`. The environments are deterministic single-shot
prompt/answer *seeders* (the live openenv contract passes only the seed prompts,
not the model) — not interactive multi-turn episodes.

**Scope:** proof-of-mechanism only — validated on SmolLM2-135M with a tiny
synthetic PRM (the PRM reward scores good completions above bad and drives GRPO's
advantages). Not a production reward-model claim; scale validation is help-wanted
(#286).


## Online DPO (`task='online_dpo'`) — judge in the loop (v0.71.31)

Unlike offline DPO (static `prompt/chosen/rejected` rows), **Online DPO** generates
two completions per prompt **on-policy** each step and asks a *judge* — or a
*reward model* — which is better; the winner becomes `chosen`, the loser
`rejected`. The judge closes the loop. Wraps TRL `OnlineDPOTrainer`; data is
prompt-only (like GRPO). Transformers + text only.

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct
task: online_dpo
data:
  train: ./data/prompts.jsonl      # prompt-only (or any format — prompts are extracted)
training:
  online_dpo_judge: "ollama://llama3.1"   # a pairwise judge (ollama://|https://|http://localhost)
  # OR: reward_model: ./my-reward-model   # exactly one of judge / reward_model
  online_dpo_loss_type: sigmoid           # sigmoid | ipo
  online_dpo_max_new_tokens: 64
  dpo_beta: 0.1
  lora: { r: 8, alpha: 16, target_modules: auto }
```

The judge is Soup's own OpenAI-compatible `JudgeEvaluator` adapted to TRL's
`BasePairwiseJudge` (swap-debiased: a winner is only recorded when both A,B and
B,A orders agree). Recipe: `online-dpo-smollm2-135m`. Proof-of-mechanism was
validated on SmolLM2-135M with a synthetic judge (not a production RLHF claim; #286).


## Weighted Multi-Objective Preference Loss

Mix DPO / SimPO / ORPO / IPO terms in one training run by setting
`preference_loss_weights` (must sum to 1.0):

```yaml
task: preference
training:
  preference_loss_weights:
    dpo: 0.6
    simpo: 0.4
```

The combine wrapper reads policy + reference summed log-probs from the inner
TRL trainer's per-batch inputs and computes a true weighted sum via the
in-tree `compute_dpo_term` / `compute_simpo_term` / `compute_orpo_term` /
`compute_ipo_term` kernels. BCO cannot be mixed with paired losses (data
format incompatible — rejected at config load).


## MoE Model Support

Fine-tune Mixture of Experts models (Mixtral, Qwen3-30B-A3B, DeepSeek V3) with ScatterMoE LoRA — applies LoRA to both attention layers and expert FFN layers:

```yaml
base: Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B
task: sft

training:
  moe_lora: true              # target expert + attention layers
  moe_aux_loss_coeff: 0.01    # router load-balancing loss
  quantization: 4bit
```

Soup auto-detects MoE architectures. Works with all training tasks.

```bash
soup init --template moe
soup train
```


## Vision / Multimodal Fine-tuning

Fine-tune vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-Vision, Qwen2-VL, Pixtral) on image+text data:

```bash
# Install vision support
pip install "soup-cli[vision]"

# Create a vision config
soup init --template vision

# Train
soup train --config soup.yaml
```

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct
task: sft
modality: vision

data:
  train: ./data/vision_train.jsonl
  format: llava
  image_dir: ./data/images
  val_split: 0.1

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-5
  quantization: 4bit
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
```

**Supported vision data formats:**

**LLaVA:**
```json
{"image": "photo.jpg", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "<image>\nDescribe this image."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "A cat on a mat."}]}
```

**ShareGPT4V:**
```json
{"image": "chart.png", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "<image>\nWhat does this show?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Quarterly revenue."}]}
```

`soup data inspect` automatically shows image statistics (count, formats, missing files) for vision datasets.


## Audio / Speech Fine-tuning

Fine-tune audio-language models (Qwen2-Audio, Whisper) on audio+text data:

```bash
# Install audio support
pip install "soup-cli[audio]"

# Create an audio config
soup init --template audio

# Train
soup train --config soup.yaml
```

```yaml
base: Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct
task: sft
modality: audio

data:
  train: ./data/audio_train.jsonl
  format: audio
  audio_dir: ./data/audio
  val_split: 0.1

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-5
  quantization: 4bit
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
```

**Audio data format:**
```json
{"audio": "recording.wav", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Transcribe this audio."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello world."}]}
```

### ASR fine-tuning (`task='asr'`, Whisper) — v0.71.32

Fine-tune Whisper on your accent or domain. whisper-tiny (39M) and base (74M)
train on a 4 GB GPU. Rows are `{"audio": <path>, "text": <transcript>}` under
`data.format='asr'`; audio decodes to 16 kHz mono through the hardened loader.

```yaml
base: openai/whisper-tiny
task: asr
data:
  train: ./data/train.jsonl
  format: asr                 # rows: {"audio": "clip.wav", "text": "hello world"}
  audio_dir: ./data/audio     # audio paths resolve here (containment-checked)
training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-4
  batch_size: 2
  asr_language: en            # optional; sets + persists the decoder prefix
  asr_task: transcribe        # transcribe | translate
  asr_lora: true              # optional LoRA on q/v; default = full fine-tune
  quantization: none
output: ./out
```

```json
{"audio": "clip0.wav", "text": "hello world"}
```

Transcribe + score after training:

```bash
soup infer --task asr --model ./out --input eval.jsonl --output preds.jsonl --audio-dir ./data/audio
# -> preds carry {"transcription", "wer", "cer"} per row + a corpus WER summary
```

Notes: `task='asr'` requires `backend='transformers'` and a Whisper base (a
non-Whisper base is rejected before download). `asr_language`/`asr_task` persist
to an `asr_generation.json` sidecar so `soup infer --task asr` restores them
(override with `--asr-language`/`--asr-task`). WER/CER use a light normalizer —
good for before/after deltas, not leaderboard-comparable absolutes.
`whisper-large-v3-asr` ships parse-only (needs a larger GPU).


## GRPO Plus — Objective Variants, Long-Context RL, Multi-Turn Agents

Soup ships seven GRPO objective variants, between-rollouts vLLM standby, four agent-rollout backends, seven stability/efficiency knobs, plus Process Reward Models and Vision-RL.

```yaml
# soup.yaml — DAPO with replay buffer and TIS truncation masking
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: grpo
data:
  train: ./prompts.jsonl
  format: chatml
training:
  reward_fn: accuracy
  num_generations: 8
  # New: GRPO objective variants
  grpo_variant: dapo                  # one of: gspo / dapo / dr_grpo / bnpo / two_sided / rft / standard
  # grpo_delta: 0.2                   # required when grpo_variant: two_sided
  grpo_fp16: true                     # FP16 RL (unsloth parity)
  # Long-context + memory-efficient RL
  long_context_grpo: true             # wires Tiled MLP when available
  vllm_sleep_mode: true               # between-rollouts vLLM standby — LIVE (vLLM >= 0.7)
  # Multi-turn agent rollout — openenv is LIVE: your function's rows replace the prompt dataset
  rollout_backend: openenv            # one of: art / ruler / nemo_gym / openenv
  rollout_func: my_module:my_rollout  # module:function resolver (openenv; trusted operator code)
  # Stability / efficiency knobs
  ref_model_ema_alpha: 0.99           # EMA sync policy → reference
  replay_buffer_size: 2048
  async_grpo_prefetch: true           # overlap rollout + train
  tis_threshold: 2.0                  # truncated importance sampling
  mask_truncated_completions: true    # paired with tis_threshold
  defer_rerolling: true
  skip_zero_advantage: true
  off_policy_mask_threshold: 0.5
```

Process Reward Models (stepwise-supervised):

```yaml
# soup.yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
task: prm                              # New: Process Reward Model
data:
  train: ./prm_dataset.jsonl
  format: prm                          # stepwise-supervised data shape
training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-5
```

Vision RL on Qwen2-VL / Pixtral / InternVL:

```yaml
# soup.yaml
base: Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
task: grpo
modality: vision
data:
  train: ./vlm_prompts.jsonl
  format: llava
training:
  reward_fn: accuracy
  vision_grpo: true                    # VLM-RL opt-in
```

All flags ship as schema gates in v0.50.0; live loss kernels, vLLM sleep-mode plumbing, ART/RULER/NeMo Gym/OpenEnv launchers, and the PRM trainer wrapper land in v0.50.1 — schema accepts the values now so configs are stable.


## DPO Training

Train with preference data using Direct Preference Optimization:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: dpo

data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo

training:
  epochs: 3
  dpo_beta: 0.1
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```


## Preference Variety — BCO + Unified Dispatcher + KL Variants

Five preference losses live behind one config knob. Pick a loss without
renaming your task, anneal β over training, and periodically refresh the
frozen reference.

### BCO (Binary Classifier Optimization)

Same input format as DPO; rows are split internally to TRL's BCO
unpaired schema (`{prompt, completion, label}`).

```yaml
task: bco
data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo
training:
  bco_beta: 0.1
```

### Unified preference dispatcher

Use `task: preference` + `training.preference_loss` to swap losses
without touching `task`. Hyperparameter sweeps over the loss type
itself become trivial.

```yaml
task: preference
data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo
training:
  preference_loss: dpo   # or simpo, orpo, ipo, bco
```

Legacy `task: dpo` / `task: simpo` / etc. remain first-class — the
unified surface is additive.

### KL-controlled DPO variants

Anneal β over training, periodically refresh the reference model:

```yaml
task: dpo   # or task: preference + preference_loss: dpo, or task: ipo
training:
  dpo_beta: 0.1
  dpo_beta_schedule: linear   # linear | cosine | exponential
  dpo_beta_end: 0.01
  dpo_ref_regen_epochs: 2     # copy student → ref model every 2 epochs
```

Both controls are gated to DPO-family tasks (`dpo`, `ipo`, or
`preference` with `preference_loss in {dpo, ipo}`); transformers
backend only.

### Multi-objective preference loss (schema-only in v0.40.0)

```yaml
task: preference
training:
  preference_loss_weights: {dpo: 0.7, bco: 0.3}
```

Schema validates 2–5 entries summing to 1. Live runtime weighted-loss
combination is wired in v0.40.1; v0.40.0 fails fast with an actionable
`NotImplementedError` if you actually try to train (same stub-then-live
pattern as v0.27.0 MII / v0.37.0 multipack / v0.38.0 quant menu /
v0.39.0 ReLoRA).


## GRPO Training (Reasoning)

Train reasoning models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (DeepSeek-R1 style):

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: grpo

data:
  train: ./data/reasoning_train.jsonl
  format: sharegpt
  max_length: 4096

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 1e-5
  grpo_beta: 0.1
  num_generations: 4
  reward_fn: accuracy   # or 'format', or path to custom .py
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```

```bash
# Create a reasoning config
soup init --template reasoning

# Train
soup train --config soup.yaml
```

**Built-in reward functions:**
- `accuracy` — checks if the final answer matches expected (supports `####` and `\boxed{}` formats)
- `format` — checks for structured `<think>...</think>` reasoning blocks

**Custom reward functions** — point to a Python file:
```python
# my_reward.py
def reward_fn(completions, **kwargs):
    """Score each completion. Return list of floats."""
    return [1.0 if "correct" in c[-1]["content"] else 0.0 for c in completions]
```
```yaml
training:
  reward_fn: ./my_reward.py
```

**Reward ensembles** — list several rewards, comma-separated, and they combine (GRPO only).
This also unlocks the `rm_ensemble` reward-hack detector, which needs ≥ 2 rewards:
```yaml
training:
  reward_fn: "accuracy,format"   # both are scored every step
```

### Synthesize a verifier from your data (`soup reward synth`)

Don't hand-write a verifier — generate one from reference (gold) outputs. Soup infers a
*deterministic* verifier (numeric / JSON-schema / regex / tool-call), writes a readable, editable
`.py`, and **refuses to emit** one that can't tell your references from auto-generated bad answers
(the mandatory calibration report). The emitted file is a normal `reward_fn: reward.py`.

```bash
# infer + calibrate + emit (exit 0 kept, 2 refused, 1 error)
soup reward synth references.jsonl -o reward.py --output-report calib.json

# preview the induced spec without writing anything
soup reward synth references.jsonl --plan-only

# force a family instead of auto-detecting
soup reward synth answers.jsonl -o reward.py --kind numeric --tolerance 1e-6
```

References are a JSONL where each row's gold answer is in an `answer` field (override with
`--field`) or the last assistant turn of a `messages` list. `--min-discrimination` sets how
strongly the verifier must separate references from perturbed negatives before it's emitted.
v1 is deterministic families only — a `\boxed{}`/`####` marker helps the numeric verifier, and
completions are prompted to mark their answer (standard RLVR practice).

### Stress-test a verifier for gameability (`soup reward stress`)

A verifier that passes calibration still might pay out for junk. `soup reward stress` feeds the
verifier deterministic degenerate completions — empty, length-padded, repeated, and
sentinel-spam — scored against your real gold answers, and flags any it **accepts**. It's the
adversarial counterpart to `synth`: calibration proves the verifier tells references from
*friendly* bad answers; `stress` asks whether a reward-hacking model could game it.

```bash
# probe a synthesized verifier (or any reward .py) — exit 0 robust, 2 gameable, 1 error
soup reward stress reward.py --references golds.jsonl --output-report stress.json

# probe a builtin verifier instead of a .py file
soup reward stress verifiable --verifiable-domain math --references golds.jsonl

# tune the attack set / accept threshold / gameability tolerance
soup reward stress reward.py --references golds.jsonl \
    --attacks empty,length,repetition,sentinel --sentinel GOLD \
    --threshold 0.5 --max-gameable 0.0
```

The report shows a per-attack accept-rate and an overall verdict. A gold-requiring verifier probed
with **no** `--references` is a hard error (it can't be measured), never a false "robust". Probing a
`.py` executes its module code, like any custom reward — only stress files you trust.

### Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)

Use `reward_fn: verifiable` with a `verifiable_domain` for deterministic, math-checkable rewards — no judge model, no heuristics. Great for GRPO on math, code, or structured-output tasks.

```yaml
training:
  reward_fn: verifiable
  verifiable_domain: math          # or: code, json_schema
  num_generations: 4
```

Three built-in domains:

| Domain | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `math` | Extracts the final numeric answer (supports `####`, `\boxed{}`) and compares via `float()` equality — no `eval()` on user output |
| `code` | Executes generated Python with a 5s timeout, 512 MB RLIMIT on POSIX, `python -I -S`, socket patch, ephemeral cwd. Output capped at 10KB. Warning panel on first use |
| `json_schema` | Validates output against a JSON Schema provided per-example in the dataset |

> **Note:** `code` domain runs untrusted generations. Soup sandboxes aggressively but never trust it for production-grade isolation — run in a VM or container for public data.


## Tool-Calling Fine-Tuning

Train models to emit structured function calls (OpenAI-style `tool_calls` with JSON arguments).

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: sft

data:
  train: ./data/tool_calls.jsonl
  format: tool-calling

training:
  epochs: 3
  lr: 2e-5
  quantization: 4bit
```

**Tool-calling data format:**
```json
{"messages": [
  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Paris?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [
    {"id": "c1", "type": "function",
     "function": {"name": "get_weather", "arguments": "{\"city\": \"Paris\"}"}}
  ]}
]}
```

Arguments are parsed as JSON only — never `eval()`. `soup eval custom` can score tool-call accuracy (function name + argument JSON equality).

```bash
soup init --template tool-calling
```


## PPO / Full RLHF Pipeline

Train models with the full RLHF pipeline: SFT warmup → Reward Model → PPO alignment.

```bash
# Create an RLHF config
soup init --template rlhf
```

**Step 1: SFT warmup** — fine-tune a base model on your data:
```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: sft
data:
  train: ./data/train.jsonl
  format: alpaca
output: ./output_sft
```

**Step 2: Train reward model** — learn preferences from human feedback:
```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: reward_model
data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo
output: ./output_rm
```

**Step 3: PPO alignment** — optimize the policy using the reward model:
```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: ppo
data:
  train: ./data/prompts.jsonl
  format: chatml
training:
  reward_model: ./output_rm
  ppo_epochs: 4
  ppo_clip_ratio: 0.2
  ppo_kl_penalty: 0.05
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
output: ./output_ppo
```

PPO supports two reward sources:
- **Reward model** (`reward_model`): pre-trained reward model (from step 2)
- **Reward function** (`reward_fn`): callable function (same as GRPO — `accuracy`, `format`, or custom `.py`)


## KTO Training (Unpaired Preferences)

Train with unpaired preference data — no need for chosen+rejected pairs:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: kto

data:
  train: ./data/kto_train.jsonl
  format: kto

training:
  epochs: 3
  kto_beta: 0.1
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```

**KTO data format:**
```json
{"prompt": "What is 2+2?", "completion": "4", "label": true}
{"prompt": "What is 2+2?", "completion": "Fish", "label": false}
```


## ORPO Training (No Reference Model)

ORPO combines SFT and alignment in one step — no reference model needed:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: orpo

data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo

training:
  epochs: 3
  orpo_beta: 0.1
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```


## SimPO Training (Simple Preference)

SimPO uses length-normalized log probabilities as implicit rewards — reference-free:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: simpo

data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo

training:
  epochs: 3
  simpo_gamma: 0.5
  cpo_alpha: 1.0
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```


## IPO Training (Regularized Preference)

IPO is a theoretically grounded DPO variant with stronger regularization:

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
task: ipo

data:
  train: ./data/preferences.jsonl
  format: dpo

training:
  epochs: 3
  ipo_tau: 0.1
  lora:
    r: 64
    alpha: 16
  quantization: 4bit
```


## RAFT — Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning

When you need a model to *cite* the document it's reading instead of hallucinating, RAFT (Stanford 2024) is the canonical recipe. Each training row carries a query, a golden document, a list of distractor documents, and the answer — the model learns to attend to the relevant doc while ignoring the noise.

```yaml
# soup.yaml
data:
  train: ./data/raft.jsonl
  format: raft

training:
  citation_faithful: true        # enable citation precision/recall scoring
  citation_style: bracket        # cite as [doc-1] inline
  citation_recall_threshold: 0.8 # gate final save on recall >= 80%
```

```jsonl
# RAFT JSONL row shape
{"query": "When was Python released?", "golden_doc": "Python was released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.", "distractor_docs": ["Ruby was released in 1995.", "Java was released in 1995."], "answer": "1991 [doc-1]"}
```

```bash
# Ready-made 8B Llama recipe
soup recipes show raft-llama3-8b
soup recipes use raft-llama3-8b
```

Citation scoring is exposed as a pure kernel for the eval gate:

```python
from soup_cli.utils.citation_faithful import score_citations

score = score_citations(
    predicted="The answer is 1991 [doc-1].",
    expected_ids=("doc-1",),
)
# CitationScore(precision=1.0, recall=1.0, f1=1.0, predicted_count=1, expected_count=1)
```

Citation-faithful FT is gated to `task in {sft, pretrain}` + `data.format='raft'` — misconfigured runs fail at config load with a named-field message.

Under the hood, a `format: raft` run trains **answer-only**: each row is composed into a prompt (golden + distractor docs, shuffled deterministically by `data.raft_shuffle_seed`, each labelled `[doc-N]`) followed by the answer; the prompt span is masked out of the loss and — when `citation_faithful: true` — the bracketed `[doc-id]` spans in the answer get a boosted per-token loss weight. Rows whose prompt fills `max_length` (answer fully truncated) are dropped with a warning rather than silently shrinking the dataset.

By default the document order is fixed for the whole run. Set `data.raft_epoch_shuffle: true` to **re-permute** the golden + distractor documents *each epoch* (a per-epoch salt folded into the shuffle seed) so the model can't latch onto a fixed citation slot — useful for multi-epoch runs. `epoch=0` reproduces the legacy single-permutation order exactly, so enabling it never changes the first epoch. (v0.71.17)

Score a trained model's citations from the CLI:

```bash
# {predicted, expected_ids} rows, OR RAFT rows scored against their own golden [doc-N]
soup eval citation preds.jsonl --style bracket
# RAFT rows: pass the train-time shuffle seed so the golden id lines up
soup eval citation raft.jsonl --shuffle-seed 0 --output citation.json
```

`soup diagnose` also gains a `citation` failure mode that flags a model that stopped citing the supporting document.


## RA-DIT — Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning

RA-DIT (Meta 2023) is the two-stage version of RAFT: first train a sentence-transformer retriever (contrastive), then fine-tune the generator on the RAFT-style rows. Two recipes ship paired:

```bash
# Stage 1 — train the retriever (uses Soup's v0.16 embedding trainer)
soup recipes use ra-dit-retriever
soup train

# Stage 2 — train the generator on RAFT data, pointing at the retriever
soup recipes use ra-dit-llama3-8b
soup train
```

The schema enforces stage-task pairing — `ra_dit_stage: retriever` requires `task: embedding`; `ra_dit_stage: generator` requires `task: sft`. A misconfigured recipe fails at config load with a named-field message.

Run both stages in one command with `soup ra-dit`:

```bash
soup ra-dit --retriever-config retriever.yaml --generator-config generator.yaml
# preview the plan + the resolved retriever link without training:
soup ra-dit -r retriever.yaml -g generator.yaml --plan-only
```

It trains the retriever, then **records** that trained retriever as the generator's paired retriever (writing its output dir into the generator's `training.ra_dit_retriever_model`) and trains the generator RAFT-style. The recorded retriever is the one used at deploy/serve time — stage-2 does not fuse the retriever weights. A plain `soup train` of a generator-stage config with no retriever model set **auto-links** the most-recent RA-DIT retriever run from the Registry; pass `--retriever-model <m>` to override.


## Curriculum-Aware Training (BETA)

Layer dynamic re-weighting on top of the static `curriculum` bucketer. Every N steps the trainer aggregates per-sample loss + grad-norm into a per-bucket uncertainty signal, runs it through a softmax (temperature-controlled) with floor (water-filling so no bucket drops below `curriculum_dynamic_floor`), and re-weights the sampler. Empty buckets fall back to the median of populated buckets; degenerate inputs return uniform.

```yaml
training:
  curriculum: true                          # static bucketer (v0.23.0)
  curriculum_buckets: 4
  curriculum_metric: perplexity             # length (default) | loss | perplexity
  curriculum_dynamic: true                  # NEW — dynamic re-weighting
  curriculum_dynamic_recompute_steps: 50    # refresh every 50 global steps
  curriculum_dynamic_floor: 0.05            # min weight per bucket
  curriculum_dynamic_temperature: 1.0       # softmax temp on uncertainty
```

**Bucketing by difficulty percentile (v0.71.5).** When `curriculum_metric` is `loss` or `perplexity`, the dynamic callback assigns each step's sample to a bucket by its *rank* within a rolling 512-step window of the difficulty signal (perplexity = `exp(min(loss, 50))`), instead of the round-robin fallback used for `length`. This keeps the buckets calibrated to the live loss distribution rather than a static length sort. `length` (the default) keeps the round-robin assignment.

Visualise the recorded bucket-weight evolution with `soup runs curriculum-curve <run_id>`.

DDP / grad-accum safety: multi-rank launches must wire an `all_reduce` hook on per-bucket stats (a cross-validator rejects un-coordinated multi-rank runs upfront). Multi-trainer expansion beyond `sft` / `pretrain` is tracked for v0.48.1.


## TTS Fine-Tuning (`task='tts'`, BETA, live in v0.71.20)

Live as of v0.71.20 (lifted from the v0.52.0 schema stub). The five families
(`orpheus`, `sesame_csm`, `llasa`, `spark`, `oute`) are all decoder language
models, so a TTS fine-tune is **next-token cross-entropy over interleaved
`[text][audio-codec-token]` chat sequences** — the same objective the SFT
trainer already runs. `TTSTrainerWrapper` reuses the SFT model/tokenizer/LoRA/CE
machinery and adds two TTS-specific pieces: per-family emotion-control
templating and registration of operator-supplied codec special tokens.

There are two workflows:

**Pre-encoded chat (live, validated).** Run the family's audio codec **offline**
so the assistant turn already contains the discrete codec-token string, then
train with `data.format: chat`. This is plain cross-entropy and runs on any GPU
(validated end-to-end on SmolLM2-135M-Instruct).

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct   # or canopylabs/orpheus-3b-0.1-ft
task: tts
modality: audio_out
data:
  train: ./data/tts_pre_encoded.jsonl   # assistant turns carry codec tokens
  format: chat
  new_special_tokens: ["<|codec_0|>", "<|codec_1|>"]   # your codec vocab
training:
  tts_family: orpheus
  tts_emotion: neutral   # Orpheus + Oute only
  lora: true
```

Operator-supplied `data.new_special_tokens` are registered (deduplicated, only
tokens not already in the vocab) and the embedding matrix is resized through the
(possibly PEFT-wrapped) model so the codec-token ids have rows. Orpheus + Oute
support emotion conditioning via `training.tts_emotion` from a per-family
allowlist (Orpheus: neutral / happy / sad / angry / excited / calm / whisper /
laugh; Oute: neutral / happy / sad / angry / calm / excited) — the wrapper
prepends the family's emotion control string to the first user turn.

**Live-codec (hardware/dependency-gated).** Setting `data.format: audio` asks
the trainer to encode raw audio into codec tokens **at train time**, which needs
the family's heavyweight codec package (`snac` for Orpheus, `moshi` for
Sesame-CSM, `xcodec2` for Llasa, `sparktts` for Spark, `outetts` for Oute). The
**Orpheus** path is live — install `pip install snac` and a 24 kHz mono wav is
encoded to SNAC codec tokens end-to-end (audio is duration- and byte-capped and
read through an `O_NOFOLLOW` fd). The other four families still surface a
friendly per-family `RuntimeError` naming the required `pip install` and are not
yet validated on the maintainer's box — use the pre-encoded workflow above for a
runnable fine-tune with those.

Five ready-made recipes ship: `orpheus-tts-sft`, `sesame-csm-tts`, `llasa-tts`,
`spark-tts`, `oute-tts` — copy with `soup recipes use <name>`. Cross-validators
reject the `mlx` backend, `modality != audio_out`, and emotion tags outside the
per-family allowlist.


## Classifier / Reranker / Cross-Encoder Training (BETA, v0.52.0)

Three new task types build on the existing embedding trainer: `task: classifier` (single-label or multi-label sequence classification), `task: reranker` (pointwise retrieval scoring), `task: cross_encoder` (paired-input scoring). Schema-only; live trainer wrapper in v0.52.1.

```yaml
base: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5
task: classifier
data:
  train: ./data/classification.jsonl
training:
  num_labels: 3
  classifier_kind: single_label
  label_names: [negative, neutral, positive]
```

`num_labels` is bounded `[1, 1024]` with explicit bool-before-int rejection; `label_names` (optional) must be unique, ≤128 chars each, and match `num_labels` in length when set.


## Knowledge Distillation (BETA, v0.52.0)

New `task: distill` with `training.teacher_model` (HF id or local path), `training.distill_divergence` (`kl` / `forward_kl` / `reverse_kl` / `js` — `kl` canonicalises to `forward_kl`), and `training.distill_temperature` (bounded `[0.05, 100.0]`, finite-only). Schema-only; live loop in v0.52.1.

```yaml
base: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B
task: distill
data:
  train: ./data/distill.jsonl
training:
  teacher_model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
  distill_divergence: forward_kl
  distill_temperature: 2.0
```

The cross-validator rejects `task='distill'` without `teacher_model`, and rejects `teacher_model` / `distill_*` fields when `task` is anything other than `distill`.


## EBFT + GDPO (BETA, v0.52.0)

Energy-Based Fine-Tuning (axolotl) lands as `training.ebft_variant ∈ {structured, strided}` + `training.ebft_temperature` (bounded `[1e-4, 100.0]`). Gated to `task: sft`. Generalized DPO lands as `training.gdpo_variant ∈ {standard, length_normalized, margin}` — gated to `task ∈ {dpo, preference}`. Live loss kernels in v0.52.1.


## gpt-oss `reasoning_effort` + `train_on_eot` (v0.52.0)

`training.reasoning_effort: low | medium | high` injects a system-prefix token at training time for gpt-oss models; `training.train_on_eot: true` includes explicit EOT/EOS control tokens in the SFT loss (axolotl `train_on_eot`). Both are gated to the SFT-family task set (`sft` / `pretrain` / `distill` / `classifier` / `reranker` / `cross_encoder`) — setting them on DPO / GRPO / PPO / etc. fails at config load. Live formatter wiring in v0.52.1.


## MoLE — Per-Token Adapter Routing (`task='moe_lora_routing'`)

Train a small **gating network** that routes each token to a weighted blend of N frozen task
LoRAs (Mixture of LoRA Experts, Wu et al. 2024). The base model and every task adapter stay
frozen — only the router learns which adapter(s) each token should use.

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: moe_lora_routing
modality: text
backend: transformers

data:
  train: ./data/chat.jsonl
  max_length: 512

training:
  mole_task_adapters:        # 2-64 LoRA adapter paths (HF ids or local dirs)
    - ./adapters/math
    - ./adapters/code
    - ./adapters/chat
  mole_top_k: 2              # 1 <= top_k <= len(mole_task_adapters)
  mole_temperature: 1.0      # [1e-6, 100.0]
  epochs: 1
```

The gate is the only trainable parameter; it is saved as `mole_gate.pt` alongside the run.
`compute_loss` runs N+1 forwards per step (base + each adapter under `torch.no_grad()`, blended
by the per-token gate weights) so step time scales with the number of task adapters. Training
only — there is no serve-time MoLE path yet. (v0.71.12)


## Architecture Knobs — Mixture-of-Depths, LLaMA Pro, LongLoRA

Three architecture transforms that were schema-only are now live for SFT / Pretrain on
Llama / Qwen / Mistral (LongLoRA also covers Phi). All apply at trainer setup:

```yaml
training:
  # Mixture-of-Depths (arXiv 2404.02258): route only the top-k tokens through each
  # block. capacity_factor is the fraction of tokens that get the residual update.
  use_mod: true
  mod_capacity_factor: 0.125

  # LLaMA Pro: append zero-initialised identity decoder blocks and train only the new
  # ones (freeze_trainable_layers freezes the originals).
  expand_layers: 4
  freeze_trainable_layers: 4

  # LongLoRA S²: shifted-sparse attention on the Q/K projections for long-context tuning.
  use_longlora: true
```

`use_mod` / `expand_layers` attach AFTER `get_peft_model` so the new routers / blocks are
trainable. Unsupported architectures warn + skip (MoD, block expansion); `use_longlora` is
rejected at the schema gate for non-supported arches and for `use_ring_attention` / FlashAttention-3.
Pick one of MoD / LLaMA Pro / LongLoRA per run. (v0.71.12)


## Spectrum — Targeted Training on Layer SNR (`soup spectrum scan`, v0.71.23)

Spectrum (arXiv:2406.06623) fine-tunes only the layers with the most signal. `soup spectrum scan`
streams a model's `.safetensors` shards **one tensor at a time** — there is no model load, so it
runs on a CPU box even for very large models — and computes a singular-value signal-to-noise ratio
per weight matrix with a Marchenko-Pastur noise threshold. It ranks the layers within each
module-type group and prints the top `--top-percent` as a ready-to-paste config block:

```bash
soup spectrum scan --model HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M --top-percent 25 --modules mlp,attn -o patch.yaml
```

```yaml
# patch.yaml — paste into your soup.yaml
training:
  unfrozen_parameters:
  - model.layers.0.mlp.down_proj
  - model.layers.29.self_attn.v_proj
  # ...
```

Then train with the patch — the SFT trainer freezes **every** parameter and unfreezes only the
matched set (full fine-tuning, LoRA off):

```yaml
base: HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M
task: sft
training:
  quantization: none        # Spectrum trains float weights — quantization off
  unfrozen_parameters:
  - model.layers.0.mlp.down_proj
  - model.layers.29.self_attn.v_proj
```

`unfrozen_parameters` entries are regex patterns matched against parameter names. It requires
`task: sft`, `backend: transformers`, `modality: text`, and `quantization: none`, and is mutually
exclusive with LoRA features (`use_dora` / `use_vera` / `moe_lora` / `relora_steps` / …) and the
other freezing knobs (`freeze_layers` / `freeze_ratio` / `train_router_only` / `expand_layers`) —
a conflicting combo is rejected loudly at config load. Scans cache under `~/.soup/spectrum/`
(override with `SOUP_SPECTRUM_CACHE_DIR`); `--no-cache` skips it. `--modules mlp,attn` (vs the
`all` default) is recommended for very large models — it skips the giant embedding/lm_head matrices.
The SNR kernel is pure-numpy and transpose-invariant, so GPT-2 `Conv1D` weights score the same as
Linear weights. (v0.71.23)
