"""Synthetic reward-hacking task for the v0.71.26 closed-loop mitigation demo.

These reward functions are the reusable GPU-experiment fixture for the
reward-hacking auto-mitigation controller. They implement a *gameable* proxy
reward that is deliberately decoupled from a held-out *true* quality score, so
a policy can visibly "hack" the proxy while the true score stagnates or drops.

Use one of the proxies as the training reward and log ``true_score`` alongside
it to see the divergence:

    soup train --config examples/reward_hacking/grpo_length_hack.yaml

Reward-function signature (TRL GRPO/PPO): ``fn(prompts, completions, **kwargs)
-> list[float]``. ``completions`` are plain strings (non-conversational) or
lists of ``{"role", "content"}`` message dicts (conversational).
