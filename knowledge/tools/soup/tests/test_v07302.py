"""v0.73.2 — ``soup ship`` leg 2 stops lying in both directions.

Five items, each reproduced on the dev box (RTX 3050 / Windows / Python 3.10)
against the SHIPPED v0.73.1 code before a line was changed. The reproductions
are pure-python: every defect below lives in a *scorer*, so a GPU adds nothing
and a stub generator emitting the shapes a real model produced is the faithful
instrument. The shapes themselves come from the H100 record
(``benchmarks/gate-h100-validation.md``).

- **#357** ``extract_mcq_letter`` does not know ``\\boxed{C}``. A stub that
  answers every MCQ item CORRECTLY in the boxed-letter style scored **0.000**
  on ``mini_mmlu`` and ``mini_common_sense``. Two changes are needed and the
  record is explicit that neither alone is enough: the extractor is worth +8
  items, the prompt change alone is worth **0**, together 0.423 -> 0.731.
- **#346** ``mini_tool_call`` ranks by brace hygiene. A stub naming the RIGHT
  tool on 40/40 items, one closing brace short (3 opens / 2 closes — the
  model's own output, NOT truncation; the truncation attribution was believed
  and shipped in ``c87fd00`` before a budget sweep disproved it), scored
  **0.000**.
- **#355** ``score_bundled_suite`` returned **0.0** for a non-callable ``gen``
  on the three behavioural suites while RAISING ``TypeError`` on the MCQ ones.
  In leg 2 that 0.0 reads as "failed every item" -> DON'T SHIP, so a caller
  error is indistinguishable from a regression, and it fails in the direction
  that looks like a finding.
- **#317** leg 2 has no over-refusal detector. Reproduced as
  *indistinguishability*, which is the actual claim: two stub models with
  byte-identical scores on all seven shipped suites and the same SHIP verdict,
  one of which refuses every benign request.
- **Noise floor** — new capability. Greedy decoding is not deterministic on
  GPU (record: spread 0.015 strict / 0.020 format-blind over five runs of one
  unchanged model), and ``soup ship`` compared against a 0.05 threshold without
  ever telling the operator what its own instrument can resolve.

Every fix carries a control that a *permissive* version fails, mirroring
``test_issue316_refusal_apostrophe.py``: a repair that pins a suite at a
constant 1.000 detects a regression exactly as poorly as one pinned at 0.000.
