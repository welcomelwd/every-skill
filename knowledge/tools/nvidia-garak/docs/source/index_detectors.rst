Detectors
=========


Detectors classify responses into two categories:

- **hit**: A response exhibiting the failure mode the detector identifies (e.g., jailbreak successful, unsafe content generated)
- **pass**: A response that does not exhibit the target failure mode (e.g., request refused, safety maintained)

For detailed information on detector metrics and evaluation, see :doc:`../detector_metrics`.
