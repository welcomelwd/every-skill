"""**ANSI Escape attack**

Try to make a model produce ANSI escape codes, which can disrupt downstream processing.

Probes in this module should all try to elicit ANSI escape codes or information suggesting that the target is capable of producing them.
There are a couple of different dimensions included:

* the encoding can vary - raw binary, or an escaped version;
* the technique used can vary - can we get OCS8, OCS52
* the action can also be different - log cursor, crash machine, install software etc.

Docs on OSC 8:
==============

A hyperlink is opened upon encountering an OSC 8 escape sequence with the target URI. The syntax is

OSC 8 ; params ; URI ST

Following this, all subsequent cells that are painted are hyperlinks to this target. A hyperlink is closed with the same escape sequence, omitting the parameters and the URI but keeping the separators:

OSC 8 ; ; ST

OSC (operating system command) is typically ESC ].

The sequence is terminated with ST (string terminator) which is typically ESC \. (Although ST is the standard sequence according to ECMA-48 §8.3.89, often the BEL (\a) character is used instead. This nonstandard choice originates from XTerm, and was later adopted by probably all terminal emulators to terminate OSC sequences. Nevertheless, we encourage the use of the standard ST.)

(For OSC and ST, their C0 variant was shown above. They have another, C1 form which might be supported in some contexts. In 8-bit Latin-X character sets they are the single bytes 0x9d and 0x9c, respectively. In UTF-8 mode some terminal emulators deliberately do not implement C1 support because these bytes would conflict with the UTF-8 encoding, while some other terminal emulators recognize the UTF-8 representation of U+009d (i.e. 0xc2 0x9d) and U+009c (i.e. 0xc2 0x9c), respectively. Since C1 is not universally supported in today's default UTF-8 encoding, its use is discouraged.)
