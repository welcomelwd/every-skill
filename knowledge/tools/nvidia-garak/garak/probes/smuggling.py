"""**Token Smuggling**

Probes that attempt to bypass filters via obfuscation of contentious terms.

This module is suitable for probes that work using token/ASCII smuggling.

Token smuggling attacks attempt to hide malicious content among benign text, in a way that bypasses alignment but is still reacted to by the target. This might involve swapping letters out for unusual unicode representations of the same letters, including meta-tokens like a zero-width space in order to break up the malicious text, or other encoding tricks.

    Programmatically replaces Latin characters in payload strings with
    visually similar Unicode homoglyphs from other scripts (Cyrillic,

    'a' in 'jailbreak', making the token sequence different while the
    text remains human-readable.

    The replacement map is configurable via the ``homoglyph_map``
    parameter, allowing the set of substitutions to be expanded or
    reduced for different resiliency testing scenarios.

    Note: this probe uses ``mitigation.MitigationBypass`` as its primary
    detector, which assumes English-language denial responses. Some
    targets respond in the same script as the obfuscated input (e.g.,
    Russian text for Cyrillic substitutions), which can produce false
    positives. A follow-up PR adds a ``ModelAsJudge``-based detector
    configured for this probe's goal to close that gap. See discussion
