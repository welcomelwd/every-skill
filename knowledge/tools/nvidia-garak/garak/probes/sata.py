"""**Simple Assistive Task Linkage**

Attacks here replace potentially violating or "harmful" text with a string
that should be converted to a [MASK] token then, links the masked query
with a simple assistive task to bypass safeguards and guardrails.

Probes in this module should implement SATA or a variant of it.

Our version uses the same instruction template as the original paper but
instead of using OpenAI GPT models, uses NLTK for speed and efficiency.
The original implementation can be found at https://github.com/xndong/SATA.

Payloads are a subset of entries from HarmBench, some of which have been gently modified.
