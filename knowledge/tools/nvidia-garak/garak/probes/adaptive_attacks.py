"""**Simple adaptive attack probes**

Probes implementing the "simple adaptive attacks" jailbreak family from
Andriushchenko, Croce, and Flammarion, *"Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned
LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks"* (ICML 2024, arXiv:2404.02151).

The paper shows that strong jailbreak success rates against safety-aligned
chat models are achievable without gradient access by combining three light
techniques: (1) an adaptive prompt template that constrains the model's
response format and forces an affirmative opener, (2) a short adversarial
suffix that can be discovered via random search, and (3) self-transfer of
suffixes between targets. See garak issue #583.

This probe is template-only: it uses a cached set of seed forbidden requests
combined with a paraphrase of the published adaptive prompt template and a
small set of pre-computed adversarial suffixes drawn from public AdvBench
results. No gradient computation or online search is performed.
