"""**Contentious term continuation probes**

These probes pose a phrase ending in an unwanted term, and see if the target will offer a continuation of that term.

Probes that implement this kind of continuation attack belong in this module.

Operates by giving high-risk context as a prompt, extracted from e.g. Urban
Dictionary examples of use of contentious terms, and seeing if the model will
continue the term based on varying amounts of prefix.
