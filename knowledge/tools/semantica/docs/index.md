```bash
pip install semantica
```

Your AI agent just made a decision. Now someone needs to explain it.

*What did it know at the time? Which facts shaped the outcome? Where did those facts come from? Has it made the same call before: and did that go well?*

If your stack can't answer those questions with a traceable record, you have a gap. Not a capability gap: an **accountability gap**. It's the reason AI hasn't landed at scale in healthcare, finance, legal, and government. And it's why teams building for those markets keep rebuilding the same guardrails from scratch.

**Semantica closes that gap.** It's the context and accountability layer that sits beneath your existing agent framework: not a replacement for LangChain or LlamaIndex, but the infrastructure that makes their outputs trustworthy.


## The Problem Every Production AI Team Hits

Powerful agents aren't automatically trustworthy ones. Five structural blind spots make modern AI systems impossible to deploy in regulated environments:

**No memory structure** — agents store embeddings, not meaning
- No way to ask *why* a fact was recalled
- No link from a recalled fact back to its source document
- Context is a black box that resets on every run

**No decision trail** — agents act continuously but record nothing
- No history to hand to a regulator or auditor
- No way to replay or reproduce a past decision
- Debugging means re-running, not reviewing

**No provenance** — outputs can't be traced to source facts
- In healthcare, finance, and legal: this is a hard compliance blocker
- No lineage from inference back to the original document
- Impossible to demonstrate what the agent actually relied on

**No reasoning transparency** — black-box answers with no explanation
- Impossible to validate the reasoning path
- Impossible to contest a specific conclusion
- No basis for improving or correcting future behavior

**No conflict detection** — contradictory facts silently coexist in vector stores
- No detection when two sources disagree
- Outputs become inconsistent and unpredictable over time
- Silent failures compound as the knowledge base grows

<Note>
  These aren't edge cases. They're why enterprise AI pilots stall: and why your compliance team keeps saying *not yet*.
</Note>


## What Semantica Adds to Your Stack

Semantica gives every agent the infrastructure it needs to be accountable. Drop it into your existing setup in minutes:

**Context Graphs** — a structured, queryable graph of everything your agent knows, decides, and reasons about
- Persistent across agent runs: no context loss between sessions
- Queryable with SPARQL and full graph algorithms
- Temporal model with `valid_from` / `valid_until` on nodes and edges
- Point-in-time snapshots of the full knowledge state

**Decision Intelligence** — every decision is a first-class object in your system
- `record_decision()` captures full lifecycle and causal chain
- Hybrid precedent search over past decisions for consistency
- `analyze_decision_impact()` shows downstream consequences
- Causal chain visualization from trigger to outcome

**Full Provenance** — every fact links to its source document and ingestion event
- W3C PROV-O compliant lineage across all modules
- Full traceability from raw input to final inference
- `recorded_at` stamping with OWL-Time export
- Audit-ready for HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, FDA 21 CFR Part 11

**Reasoning Engines** — explainable reasoning paths, not black boxes
- Forward chaining, Rete, deductive, abductive
- SPARQL query-based inference over RDF graphs
- Datalog with recursive Horn clause rules
- Every conclusion backed by a traceable derivation path

**Temporal Intelligence** — your graph knows not just *what*, but *when*
- Allen interval algebra: all 13 temporal relations
- Point-in-time queries over historical graph states
- Temporal provenance stamping on every fact
- OWL-Time export for standards-compliant archiving

**Ontology Hub** — full ontology lifecycle in the browser
- Visual editor for schema design and editing
- SHACL Studio for constraint authoring and validation
- Alignment authoring across multiple ontologies
- Health dashboard and version control built in

<Tip>
  Works alongside any LLM provider and any agent framework: add it to an existing stack without changing your architecture.
