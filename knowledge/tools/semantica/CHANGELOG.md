## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Embedded Oxigraph backend for `TripletStore`** (#838, closes #834) by @Linxiushen
  - Added `OxigraphStore` (`semantica/triplet_store/oxigraph_store.py`), an in-process SPARQL 1.1 store via the optional `pyoxigraph` dependency — no external server (Blazegraph/Jena/RDF4J/Anzo) required, fixing the confusing plain connection-error failure `TripletStore` previously produced with no server running (no local Docker daemon, no Java, CI, or a fresh laptop)
  - Runs fully in memory by default, or persists to a local directory via `TripletStore(backend="oxigraph", path=...)`; reopening the same directory resumes existing data
  - Full CRUD, native batch loading (`Store.extend`), named-graph scoping (`graph=` on add/query), and SPARQL SELECT/ASK/CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE result mapping matching the existing backend contract; reuses `sparql_escaping.py` for datatype-IRI resolution instead of reimplementing it, and preserves RDF literal datatype/language metadata across writes, reads, and query results
  - New optional `semantica[tripletstore-oxigraph]` extra (`pyoxigraph>=0.5.0`), included in the `all` extra; the import is lazy, so `TripletStore` and the rest of Semantica keep working without `pyoxigraph` installed
  - Wired into `TripletStore` (`backend="oxigraph"`, added to `SUPPORTED_BACKENDS` and `NAMED_GRAPH_CAPABLE_BACKENDS`) and exported from `semantica.triplet_store`; README, module reference, glossary, and usage guide updated with install/configuration examples
  - **Fixed along the way**: a missing `pyoxigraph` install surfaced as a generic wrapped `ProcessingError` instead of the underlying `ImportError` and its install hint, because `TripletStore._initialize_store_backend()`'s broad `except Exception` caught and rewrapped it; `ImportError` is now re-raised as-is so the `pip install "semantica[tripletstore-oxigraph]"` hint reaches the caller
  - New integration tests in `tests/triplet_store/test_oxigraph_store.py` covering persistence/reopen, named-graph isolation, SELECT/ASK/CONSTRUCT result shapes, and the missing-dependency error message; skipped automatically when `pyoxigraph` isn't installed, and not yet exercised in CI since it doesn't install the optional extra or run the Python test suite

- **PROV-O trust blockers and general spec completeness for `ProvenanceManager`** (#825) by @KaifAhmad1
  - **Invalidation instead of hard delete**: new `ProvenanceManager.invalidate(entity_id, agent_id, reason=None)` tombstones an entry — archives its pre-invalidation state under a stable versioned key, then appends the invalidated entry (`invalidated`, `invalidated_at_time`, `invalidated_by`, `invalidation_reason`) — instead of mutating or deleting it, so an audit can prove a fact existed, was reviewed, and was retracted. `ProvenanceManager.clear()` remains the bulk dev/test store-reset utility it always was; it was not repurposed
  - **Hash-chained integrity**: every entry now carries `sequence_id`/`previous_checksum`, chaining it to the entry immediately before it in insertion order. New `ProvenanceManager.verify_chain()` walks the chain and reports any break, including a row hard-deleted directly from the underlying table — something a lone per-row SHA-256 checksum can never detect on its own. `compute_checksum()` now also covers `agent_id`/`agent_type`, the lineage-link fields, and the invalidation fields, closing several fields that previously weren't tamper-evident
  - **Typed Agent/Activity**: `agent_id` was a dead field — no `track_*` method read it from kwargs, so it was always the `"semantica"` default regardless of what callers passed; fixed, and paired with new `AgentRecord(id, agent_type, is_automated)` / `ActivityRecord(id, activity_type, started_at_time, ended_at_time)` dataclasses (pass via `agent=`/`activity=` kwargs) so a human reviewer, an LLM call, and an automated pipeline stage are now distinguishable, and activities carry real start/end timing. Wired through all 18 `*_provenance.py` wrapper modules and `track_entity`/`track_relationship`/`track_chunk`/`track_property_source`
  - **Versioning vs. derivation split**: new `previous_version_id` ("this corrects a prior version of the same fact") and `derived_from_id` ("this was derived from a different source entity") fields, additive alongside the legacy combined `parent_entity_id` so existing readers are unaffected
  - **Downstream lineage traversal**: new `get_descendants()`/`trace_descendants()` (reverse BFS in both `InMemoryStorage` and `SQLiteStorage`), closing the gap flagged in `semantica/explorer/routes/provenance.py` where `direction="downstream"` was dead code with no reverse lookup to feed it; the Explorer's `/api/provenance` lineage response now merges both directions
  - **W3C PROV-O qualified relations**: `export_prov()` now emits `prov:qualifiedAssociation`/`hadRole` (distinguishing "approved by" from "generated by" for sign-off workflows), `qualifiedGeneration`/`Generation`, `qualifiedUsage`/`Usage`, `qualifiedDerivation`/`Derivation`, `qualifiedInvalidation`/`Invalidation`, `wasAssociatedWith` (Activity→Agent), `actedOnBehalfOf` (Agent→Agent delegation), and `wasInformedBy` (Activity→Activity, via a new `informed_by=[...]` kwarg), alongside the existing plain triples
  - **Bitemporal + Bundle support**: `revision_type`/`supersedes`/`valid_from`/`valid_until` fields (plain caller-supplied passthrough, matching the deprecated `kg.ProvenanceTracker`'s actual contract) plus new `revision_history()` and `query_recorded_between()` methods, closing the two "no direct equivalent yet" rows in `docs/migration/kg-provenance-tracker.md`; `bundle_id` emits `prov:Bundle`/`hadMember` membership triples to partition provenance by source/dataset/ingestion-run
  - **Configurable, interlinked namespace**: `export_prov(base_uri=...)` / `--base-uri` CLI flag, defaulting to a new `ProvenanceManager.DEFAULT_BASE_URI` (`https://semantica.dev/ns#`) that `RDFExporter`'s `NamespaceManager` and `OWLExporter`'s default `ontology_uri` now both reuse, so KG-exported, OWL-exported, and PROV-exported URIs for the same `entity_id` co-resolve instead of three independently-hardcoded placeholder domains
  - New CLI commands: `semantica provenance invalidate|verify-chain|descendants`
  - **Fixed along the way**: `track_entities_batch()` silently absorbed batch-level typed kwargs (`agent_id`, `entity_type`, `activity_id`) into the opaque `metadata` JSON blob instead of forwarding them, so the documented banking example in `docs/guides/provenance.md` never actually worked as written
  - **Fixed along the way**: `compute_checksum()` had to exclude `entity_id` itself from the hash — `track_entity()`'s versioning archives a prior value by copying it to a new key (`"X"` → `"X:v:<timestamp>"`), and hashing `entity_id` meant that legitimate relabel permanently orphaned any other entry that had already chained its `previous_checksum` from the pre-relabel value, surfacing as a false-positive "broken chain." Archival and invalidation are now always a pure relabel (unchanged checksum/sequence position) followed by a fresh chained append, never an in-place mutation of an already-chained entry
  - **Fixed along the way**: `InMemoryStorage.get_chain_head()` ignored the already-committed chain head whenever the current transaction had staged any entries, understating the head and corrupting the next append's chain link
  - **Fixed along the way**: several new `ProvenanceEntry` fields were initially wired into the dataclass and `export_prov()` but not into `SQLiteStorage`'s DDL/INSERT/row-mapping — `InMemoryStorage` stores the dataclass directly so it masked the gap. Added a permanent regression test (`test_all_fields_round_trip_through_sqlite`) asserting every field survives a SQLite round trip, to catch this class of bug for any future field additions
  - Flagged, not fixed (separate, pre-existing issues independent of #825): `semantica/pipeline/pipeline_provenance.py` imports a nonexistent module and wraps a `Pipeline` dataclass with no `run()` method, so `PipelineWithProvenance` has never worked; most of the 18 wrapper modules' backing classes are themselves missing or incomplete (e.g. `context.context_manager`, `deduplication.deduplicator`, `normalize.normalizer` don't exist; `EmbeddingGenerator` exists but has no `.embed()`); `kg_provenance.py` passes `entity_type` inside its `metadata={}` dict instead of as a top-level `track_entity()` kwarg across most of its ~30 call sites, so it never actually populates the real field
  - Extensive new test coverage across `tests/provenance/test_manager.py`, `test_schemas.py`, and `test_storage.py` (invalidation, hash-chain verification including a simulated hard-delete-detection case and an interleaved-chaining stress test, agent/activity typing, versioning/derivation split, downstream lineage, qualified export triples, bitemporal methods, Bundle export, and namespace interlinking)

- **Altair Anzo triplet store backend** (#813) by @KaifAhmad1
  - Added `AnzoStore` (`semantica/triplet_store/anzo_store.py`), a fourth peer to `BlazegraphStore`/`RDF4JStore`/`JenaStore` speaking plain SPARQL 1.1 over HTTP — no new dependency, since Anzo has no official Python SDK but needs none
  - The one structural difference from the existing backends: Anzo addresses data by a dataset/graphmart **URI** (`dataset_uri`, required) rather than a short namespace/repository name, so the endpoint path (`<endpoint>/sparql/<store_type>/<url-encoded_dataset_uri>`) percent-encodes it; `store_type` defaults to `"graphmart"` and can be set to `"dataset"`
  - Reuses the shared `sparql_escaping.py` literal-escaping, datatype-IRI resolution, and CONSTRUCT-detection helpers rather than reimplementing them, matching `BlazegraphStore`'s CONSTRUCT/bindings `execute_sparql` contract exactly
  - Wired into `TripletStore` (`backend="anzo"`, added to `SUPPORTED_BACKENDS` and `NAMED_GRAPH_CAPABLE_BACKENDS`) and `config.py` (`TRIPLET_STORE_ANZO_ENDPOINT` env var / `anzo_endpoint` config key), and exported from `semantica.triplet_store`
  - 32 new tests in `tests/triplet_store/test_anzo_store.py` (mocked HTTP, no live Anzo instance needed), including dataset-URI percent-encoding cases that don't apply to the other backends
  - Bulk loading uses SPARQL `INSERT DATA` (the same approach `BlazegraphStore` uses) rather than Anzo's separate HTTP Client Interface, keeping the `bulk_load()` contract identical across backends

- **Comprehensive unit and security test suite for the `/api/sparql` Explorer route** (#773) by @Sameer6305
  - Added `tests/explorer/test_sparql_route.py` (34 tests) covering the SPARQL Explorer route (`semantica/explorer/routes/sparql.py`), which executes arbitrary SPARQL queries against an in-memory rdflib projection of the live graph and previously had zero test coverage
  - Verified read-only allowlist enforcement against write and mutation queries (`INSERT DATA`, `DELETE DATA`, `DELETE WHERE`, `DROP ALL`, `CLEAR ALL`, `LOAD`, `CREATE GRAPH`, `MODIFY`, comments, and multi-statement injections like `SELECT ... ; DROP ALL`), confirming rejected queries short-circuit before any graph is built or queried
  - Verified resource-limiting behavior, confirming row capping (`_SPARQL_MAX_ROWS`) truncates results and sets `truncated: true`, query timeout (`_SPARQL_TIMEOUT_S`) returns a clean error message without crashing, and concurrency semaphore (`_SPARQL_MAX_CONCURRENT`) prevents thread starvation under load
  - Verified RDF projection fidelity for node properties and edge relationships, and error formatting for malformed SPARQL syntax with line and column extraction
  - Follow-up review fixes (#805): extracted the duplicated row-cap-and-truncate loop (previously copy-pasted between the `CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE` and `SELECT` branches) into a shared `_cap_rows()` helper so the `_SPARQL_MAX_ROWS` cap is enforced identically by both; added `test_row_cap_truncates_construct_results`, since the truncation path for `CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE` results had no direct test coverage even though `SELECT` truncation did

- **Global default persistent storage for `ProvenanceManager`, plus a working `provenance` CLI** (#795, #802) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - Every ingestion/processing module (`kg_provenance.py`, `pipeline_provenance.py`, and 20+ other call sites) instantiated its own `ProvenanceManager()` with no `storage_path`, so all of them silently fell back to `InMemoryStorage` and the SQLite audit trail was never actually written. `ProvenanceManager.set_default_storage_path(path)` now sets a class-level default that every no-arg instantiation picks up, and `Semantica.__init__` wires `config.provenance.storage_path` into it automatically during orchestrator init
  - Added the thread-safe `default_storage_path(path)` context manager (`semantica.provenance.default_storage_path`) for test isolation — it stacks nested overrides and guarantees restoration of the previous default on exit, even on exception, so tests can't leak global state into each other
  - Fixed `ProvenanceManager.__init__` raising `TypeError` on the CLI's `config=` kwarg, and implemented the four methods the CLI already called but that didn't exist on the class: `lineage()`, `audit_log()`, `export_prov()` (W3C PROV-O turtle/ntriples/jsonld via `rdflib`), and `check()` — unblocking `semantica provenance lineage|audit|export|check` end-to-end
  - Follow-up review fixes: `track_entity` no longer aliases a caller-supplied `used_entities` list (it copied the reference and later mutated it in place via `.append()`, which could corrupt a list the caller still held); removed dead fallback branches in `orchestrator.py`/`manager.py` left over from not realizing `Config.get()` already resolves dotted paths; added a `--dry-run` option to `provenance audit` to match `provenance export` (previously only the global `--dry-run` flag worked, not a local one); and `provenance check --strict` no longer prints a green "✓" success line immediately before failing — a failing check now renders as a warning before the `ClickException` is raised

- **Markdown round-trip export/import for `AgentMemory`** (#765, #786) by @SaurabhScripts and @Sameer6305
  - `AgentMemory.export(format="markdown")` and `import_data(format="markdown")` add a human-editable, diff-friendly alternative to the existing JSON/dict serialization: one Markdown file per memory item, with `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `type`/`kind` in required YAML frontmatter and the memory content as the Markdown body
  - Exporting without a `destination` returns a single memory as a Markdown string; exporting a set requires a destination directory and writes one stable, content-hashed filename per memory ID, so re-exporting an unchanged set is byte-for-byte idempotent
  - Importing upserts by ID: unknown IDs create new memories, known IDs replace them atomically (local state and vector store are only mutated after the whole batch validates cleanly), and unchanged re-imports are a deterministic no-op
  - Malformed frontmatter, duplicate IDs within an import batch, and duplicate YAML keys are all rejected before any memory is mutated, with actionable error messages
  - Export refuses to overwrite symbolic links and replaces files atomically; import safely compares timezone-aware and timezone-naive timestamps so retention, recency sorting, and date filters stay correct across both
  - Entities and relationships round-trip as memory-local provenance only — Markdown import intentionally does not write into `ContextGraph`, matching the MVP scope agreed on in #765
  - Documented the file contract and workflow in `docs/reference/context.md`; 43 new tests in `tests/context/test_agent_memory_markdown.py` cover round-trip losslessness, idempotency, validation errors, rollback on failure, and vector-store sync ordering

### Fixed

- **`VectorStore.search_vectors()` returned inconsistent result shapes across backend implementations** (#853, closes #845) by @Sameer6305, reviewed by @KaifAhmad1
  - Every built-in backend (FAISS, Milvus, pgvector, Pinecone, Qdrant, SQLite-vec, Weaviate, in-memory) now returns the same canonical `SearchResult` shape (`id`, `score`, `metadata`, `vector`, `distance`), instead of some backends omitting `vector`/`metadata`/`distance` or, for Weaviate, returning a backend-specific `properties` key instead of `metadata`
  - Added a `SearchResult` `TypedDict` (`semantica/vector_store/vector_store.py`, exported from `semantica.vector_store`) documenting the contract; `metadata` now always defaults to `{}` rather than being absent, and `id` accepts `Union[str, int]` to accommodate Milvus/Qdrant's native integer IDs without casting
  - **Review fix**: the score-normalization formula added for Pinecone and Qdrant (`1.0 / (1.0 + max(0.0, 1.0 - score))`) clamped every raw score `>= 1.0` to an identical `1.0`, silently collapsing result ranking whenever the raw score could exceed 1 — which happens routinely for dot-product-metric indexes (unbounded), as opposed to cosine (bounded to `[-1, 1]`). Replaced with `(score / (1 + |score|) + 1) / 2`, which is strictly monotonic and bounded in `(0, 1)` for any real input, so ranking order is preserved regardless of metric or vector normalization
  - Added `test_qdrant_unbounded_dot_product_scores_preserve_ranking` and `test_pinecone_unbounded_dotproduct_scores_preserve_ranking` (`tests/vector_store/test_search_result_schema.py`) asserting normalized scores stay strictly ordered and bounded for raw scores well above 1.0, the case the original formula silently collapsed and the existing tests (which only used scores `< 1`) never exercised
  - Left out of scope, per the original PR: Weaviate's `similarity_search()` still isn't wired into `VectorStore.search_vectors()`'s backend dispatch; Milvus's collection schema still has no metadata column so its results always return `metadata: {}`; and `include_vectors` support (populating the `vector` field) is not yet implemented for any backend

- **`DecisionEmbeddingPipeline.find_similar_decisions()` crashed with `AttributeError` for any `VectorStore` backend other than `inmemory`** (#842, closes #839) by @Sameer6305
  - `_get_candidate_embeddings()` iterated `VectorStore.vectors`/`VectorStore.metadata` directly, internal dicts only populated for `backend="inmemory"`; every persistent backend (FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant, Milvus, ...) raised `AttributeError`. It now fetches candidates via the backend-agnostic `VectorStore.search_vectors()`, reading metadata via a `res.get("metadata") or res.get("payload")` fallback for backends that key it differently
  - Backends such as FAISS don't return the raw vector for each hit; `find_similar_decisions()` and `_find_semantic_similar()` now fall back to the search-provided score (normalized from `distance` when present) as the semantic similarity for those candidates instead of computing cosine similarity against a zero placeholder vector
  - `get_decision_statistics()` had the identical bug iterating `store.metadata.values()`; it now returns a limited stats payload with an explanatory `warning` field for backends that don't expose a full in-memory metadata dict, instead of crashing
  - **Fixed along the way**: `_get_candidate_embeddings()`'s expand-and-retry loop (which widens the search pool when post-filtering leaves too few matches) discarded every candidate it had found once the pool hit its cap (`limit * 10`) without ever collecting `limit` matches or getting a short page back from the backend — the loop fell through without executing the branch that assigns results, silently returning `[]` even when matching candidates existed. It now falls back to the last batch collected instead of dropping it
  - Added end-to-end regression tests against real `inmemory` and `faiss` backends (no mocks) plus a targeted unit test for the expand-and-retry loop's fallback behavior

- **`QdrantStore.search_vectors()` returned results keyed by `"payload"` instead of `"metadata"`** (#841, closes #840) by @divyankshah
  - `QdrantCollection.search_points()` built its result dicts as `{"id", "score", "payload"}`, while `PineconeStore.search_vectors()` and every other backend consumed by `HybridSearch` use `"metadata"`. This silently dropped Qdrant metadata from results and made `HybridSearch.filter_by_metadata()` reject every candidate whenever a filter was applied, since it looks up `result["metadata"]` and got nothing back
  - Normalized `search_points()` to return `"metadata"` instead of `"payload"`, matching the existing convention; no other module reads the old key, so the rename is a straight fix rather than a partial one
  - Extended `tests/vector_store/test_vector_store_deepdive.py::test_qdrant_store` to assert the returned key is `"metadata"` (not `"payload"`) and that `HybridSearch.filter_by_metadata()` correctly matches against Qdrant results end-to-end

- **Explorer Temporal panel never rendered after clicking the toolbar button** (#830, #836) by @Sameer6305
  - The panel stayed permanently stuck on "Loading temporal…" in `npm run dev`, with repeating "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors in the browser console. Two independent render loops were responsible:
  - **Diagnostics state churn**: `handleDiagnosticsChange` unconditionally called `setGraphDiagnosticsState` on every invocation. `buildEffectAvailability` (inside `GraphCanvas`'s diagnostics `useEffect`) always returns a new object, so each call scheduled a re-render that immediately retriggered the effect. Fixed by comparing the incoming snapshot field-by-field against the last accepted value via `lastDiagnosticsRef` before calling `setState`
  - **scrubberTime churn**: React 18 concurrent mode re-ran `TimelinePanel`'s `useEffect` with a structurally-new `Date` object for the same timestamp when speculative renders discarded `useMemo` caches, causing repeated `setScrubberTime` calls that propagated into `temporalState` churn and retriggered the diagnostics effect. Fixed by deduplicating by millisecond value via `onTimeChange`/`lastScrubberMsRef`
  - **Bonus**: `temporal-overlay`'s `shouldLoad` predicate was changed to gate strictly on `panelState["temporal-panel"]`, removing the `|| temporalState?.currentTime` branch that caused eager loading on every scrubber update and continuously cancelled in-flight `load()` completions
  - **Bonus**: `temporalState` removed from the plugin-loading `useEffect` dependency array; predicates extracted into `pluginRegistryPredicates.ts` and wired through `GraphWorkspace.tsx` so regression tests exercise the production code rather than a local copy
  - The `scrubberTime`-churn fix was also applied to the equivalent (but currently unused/unmounted) `GraphWorkspaceShell.tsx`, which shares the same `TimelinePanel` integration pattern but does not have the diagnostics-churn code path
  - **Follow-up review fix**: the diagnostics dedup's `structureLayer` comparison now also covers `disabledReason`, `curveCount`, `bridgeCurveCount`, and `backboneCurveCount` (previously only `cacheKey`/`lastDrawAt`/`enabled` were compared, so a pure `disabledReason` transition could leave the dev-only diagnostics panel stale)
  - **Follow-up review fix**: `test:graph-store`, `test:graph-workspace`, and the new `test:plugin-registry` regression test are now run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — previously none of the Explorer frontend's `node --test` suites executed anywhere in CI, only `npm run build`, so this fix's own regression coverage (and all prior frontend test coverage) provided no protection against silent regressions
- **`HybridSearch.search()` crashed with `AttributeError` for any `VectorStore` backend other than `inmemory`** (#833, #837) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `HybridSearch.search()` read `self.vector_store.vectors` directly, an internal dict `VectorStore` only populates for `backend="inmemory"`; every other backend (faiss, weaviate, qdrant, milvus, pinecone, pgvector, sqlite) raised `AttributeError`, making `HybridSearch` unusable against any real store. It now delegates to `VectorStore.search_vectors()` (the backend-agnostic public API) for non-inmemory backends, applies `metadata_filter` as a post-filter over the returned candidates, and normalizes results to a consistent `{id, score, distance, metadata}` shape
  - **Fixed along the way**: `vector_ids` could stay `None` when callers passed explicit `vectors`/`metadata` without `vector_ids`, crashing downstream list indexing — now defaulted to generated positional IDs
  - **Fixed along the way**: a `query_vector` passed as a plain list crashed backend stores (e.g. `FAISSStore.search_similar`) that call `.ndim` on it — now normalized to a numpy array up front
  - **Fixed along the way**: `VectorStore.store_vectors()` silently dropped metadata for FAISS (and any `add_vectors`-only backend) because it called `add_vectors(vectors, **options)` without forwarding `metadata`, even though `FAISSStore.add_vectors()` accepts it — this blocked `HybridSearch`'s metadata filtering from ever matching anything on FAISS
  - **Follow-up review fixes**: the legacy `top_k` kwarg was read but left in `options`, then forwarded via `**options` into `VectorStore.search_vectors()`, colliding with backends (sqlite, pgvector) that pass an explicit `top_k=k` to their own `search()` and raising `TypeError: got multiple values for keyword argument 'top_k'` — now popped instead of just read; `VectorStore.search_vectors()`'s dispatch only recognized backend methods named `search`/`search_similar`, so delegation still hit `NotImplementedError` for qdrant/milvus/pinecone, which name their method `search_vectors()` with a differently-named count parameter (`limit` vs `k`) — added a third dispatch branch that binds the count positionally so it works regardless of the backend's parameter name; a missing `distance` in backend-delegated results defaulted to the raw `score`, silently reusing the local path's cosine-similarity convention (`distance = 1 - score`) even for backends using unrelated metrics (L2, inner product) — now left as `None` instead of a fabricated, metric-inconsistent value
  - Verified across all 7 supported backends: `inmemory`/`faiss`/`sqlite` work live end-to-end; `pgvector`'s dispatch reaches `PgVectorStore.add()`/`.search()` (blocked only by no Postgres server in the verification sandbox); `qdrant`/`milvus`/`pinecone` now reach their real `search_vectors()` method instead of crashing, though their storage side (`store_vectors()`) still doesn't recognize `insert_vectors`/`upsert_vectors`, and `weaviate` remains entirely unwired (`add_objects`/`query_vectors`) on both sides — both are separate, pre-existing gaps independent of this fix, left for a follow-up

- **`VectorStore.store_vectors()` silently dropped metadata for FAISS (and any `add_vectors`-only) backend** (#832, #835) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `store_vectors()` fell into a branch that called `self._backend_store.add_vectors(vectors, **options)` without `metadata` whenever the backend exposed `add_vectors()` but neither `add()` nor `store_vectors()` — true for `FAISSStore`, the backend most real usage configures for genuine ANN search. Every caller that stores vectors with metadata (e.g. `AgentMemory._store_memory_vector()`, used internally by `AgentContext.store()`) lost that metadata once it reached FAISS, with no error or warning
  - Downstream, `ContextRetriever._retrieve_from_vector()` recovers a result's text via `metadata.get("content", "")`, which was always `""` for any vector stored this way; `_rank_and_merge()` then embedded that empty string, tripping `TextEmbedder.embed_text()`'s empty-text rejection and masking the real bug as a spurious `TextEmbedder` failure recorded by the progress tracker
  - `store_vectors()` now forwards `metadata` to `add_vectors()`, but only when the backend's `add_vectors()` signature actually accepts it (checked via `inspect.signature`, accepting either an explicit `metadata` parameter or a `**kwargs` catch-all), so a future/custom backend with a stricter signature raises no `TypeError`
  - **Follow-up review fix**: the `inspect.signature()` probe is wrapped in `try/except (ValueError, TypeError)`, consistent with the identical pattern already used in `ProvenanceManager.trace_lineage()`, so signature introspection failing on an unusual callable can no longer abort `store_vectors()` before it even attempts to call the backend

- **`AgnoDecisionKit.check_policy` silently treated unevaluable policy rules as compliant** (#778, #822) by @Sameer6305
  - `_eval_rule()` previously `return`ed `True` when a rule referenced a field missing from the decision payload, or when the rule string didn't match the expected `<field> <op> <value>` format — the docstring's claim that exceptions never silently return `compliant=True` didn't cover this, since neither path raised
  - Both cases now raise `ValueError` instead, which routes through `check_policy`'s existing exception handler and records a `warnings` entry (e.g. `"Could not evaluate rule 'minimum_score >= 0.9': rule references undefined field 'minimum_score'"`) instead of disappearing with no signal
  - `violations`/`compliant` are unaffected — an unevaluable rule is not counted as a violation, since it's genuinely unknown whether it would have passed; this matches the existing `compliant`/`violations`/`warnings` shape already used by `ContextGraph.enforce_decision_policy`
  - This is additive: `warnings` was already part of the return contract and populated for other exception cases, so no caller that only checks `compliant` is affected, and no existing test asserts `warnings == []` for a payload that hits either of these paths
  - **Follow-up review fix**: `check_policy` decoded `policy_rules` with `json.loads` and iterated the result without checking it was actually a list; a JSON-encoded bare string (e.g. `policy_rules='"confidence >= 0.7"'`) decodes to a `str`, so iterating it evaluated one "rule" per character — combined with the fix above, an 18-character rule string produced 17 warnings instead of being treated as the single rule it was meant to be. A decoded string is now wrapped as a single-element rule list; any other non-list shape (number, object, etc.) or non-string list element now produces exactly one `warnings` entry instead of silently misbehaving or being iterated character-by-character
  - **Follow-up review fix**: `_eval_rule` used `data.get(field) is None` to detect a missing field, which can't distinguish a genuinely absent key from a key explicitly present with a JSON `null` value — both produced the same "undefined field" warning, misdiagnosing nullable fields. Field presence is now checked with `field not in data` first; a present-but-`null` value now raises a distinct `"field {field!r} is null — cannot evaluate rule"` message instead of the misleading "undefined field" one
  - **Follow-up review fix**: `check_policy` only checked that `decision_data` was valid JSON, not that it decoded to an object. When it decoded to a list, `field not in data` silently became list-*membership* testing instead of a key check (e.g. `"confidence" not in ["confidence", 0.95]` is `False`), so a matching rule fell through to `data["confidence"]`, which raised a raw, confusing `TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str` instead of any meaningful diagnostic; numbers/strings/bools produced similarly opaque `TypeError`s. `check_policy` now rejects any `decision_data` that doesn't decode to a JSON object upfront with a single clear `violations` entry, the same way it already rejects malformed JSON
  - Added 15 tests to `tests/integrations/agno/test_decision_kit.py` covering the missing-field case (the issue's traced example), the malformed-rule-string case, the bare-JSON-string `policy_rules` amplification case, non-list/non-string `policy_rules` shapes, the missing-key-vs-null-value distinction, non-object `decision_data` shapes (list/number/string/bool/null), and regression checks confirming normal rule evaluation on present fields is unchanged

- **No cycle detection for SKOS concepts at write time** (#774, #819) by @mikemikimike, reviewed by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - Added cycle detection (`validate_skos_hierarchy`) for `skos:broader` and `skos:narrower` relationships in `ContextGraph.add_edge()` and `ContextGraph.add_edges()`, preventing direct 2-node cycles, self-loops, and multi-hop hierarchy cycles
  - Added `GraphSession.add_nodes_and_edges()` to validate SKOS hierarchy edges upfront under lock before node insertion, preventing partial-write leaks where nodes remain after a cyclic edge is rejected
  - Updated vocabulary, ontology (`/api/ontology/load`, `/api/ontology/create`), and JSON/CSV import routes to use `add_nodes_and_edges()` and return HTTP 422 with actionable error messages when a cycle is detected
  - Follow-up fix by @KaifAhmad1: `validate_skos_hierarchy()` previously re-walked *every* SKOS hierarchy edge already in the graph on each write, so one pre-existing cycle anywhere (e.g. legacy data) blocked all unrelated future writes; it now only traverses concepts touched by the edges being written, while still checking against existing edges for cycles that span old and new data
  - Follow-up fix by @KaifAhmad1: in `/api/ontology/load`, `except HTTPException: raise` was unreachable because a broader `except Exception` clause above it already matched `HTTPException`, so a 422 raised after a successful `OntologyIngestor` parse was silently swallowed and reprocessed via the fallback RDF parser; reordered the clauses so the deliberate 422 always propagates
  - Follow-up fix (#775): `/api/ontology/{uri}/refresh` was missed by the original sweep and still called `session.add_nodes()` then `session.add_edges()` as two independent operations, so a cyclic SKOS edge rejected by `add_edges()` left the nodes from the preceding `add_nodes()` call committed to the graph; switched to `session.add_nodes_and_edges()` with the same `except ValueError` → HTTP 422 handling already used by `/api/ontology/load` and `/api/ontology/create`. Audited every other `add_nodes()`/`add_edges()` pairing in the repo (`GraphStore`, `graph_builder.py`, `agent_memory.py`, `context_graph.py.load()`, `enrich.py`) — none share `GraphSession`'s SKOS-cycle-validation write path, so none were changed

- **Agno `_AgentScopedStore.upsert_memory` silently swallowed decision recording failures** (#779)
  - `upsert_memory()` now logs `logger.warning("[%s] record_decision failed: %s", self._role, exc, exc_info=True)` when `record_decision()` fails, matching the error-logging convention used for `store()` in the same method with traceback context preserved
  - Preserves graceful fallback behavior: `record_decision()` remains optional and `upsert_memory()` continues without propagating the exception
  - Added regression coverage in `tests/integrations/agno/test_shared_context.py` for both `store()` and `record_decision()` warning paths

- **`AgnoDecisionKit`/`AgnoKGToolkit` silently swallowed Agno tool registration failures** (#780, #818) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - Removed the `try/except: pass` wrapped around `self.register(fn)` in both toolkits' `__init__`; when Agno is installed, a registration failure now propagates immediately instead of leaving the toolkit half-registered with no signal to the caller
  - Graceful degradation when Agno isn't installed (`AGNO_AVAILABLE=False`) is unchanged — `_tools` is still populated so callers can introspect available tools without the package
  - Fixed a related duplicate-entry bug: `self._tools` was appended to unconditionally *before* `register()` ran, which could double-count a tool when Agno's own `Toolkit.register()` also tracks it in `self._tools`
  - This is a behavior change for callers that construct these toolkits expecting instantiation to always succeed — audited: no in-repo call site relies on the old silent-failure behavior
  - Expanded `tests/integrations/agno/test_decision_kit.py` and `test_kg_toolkit.py` with coverage for registration invocation counts, failure propagation, graceful degradation, and no-duplicate-`_tools` assertions

- **`ProvenanceManager` tracking methods silently swallowed failures without logging and returned fabricated entries** (#783)
  - `track_relationship()`, `track_chunk()`, and `track_property_source()` now return `Optional[ProvenanceEntry]` (`None` on storage failure, consistent with #782's `track_entity` fix) instead of a fabricated populated object
  - `_save_entry()` now always logs on any storage failure, including previously-silent per-item batch failures
  - `track_entities_batch()` and `track_chunks_batch()`'s rare block-level transaction failures are now logged too
  - `source_tracker.py`'s `track_sources_batch()` no longer counts failed tracking calls in its stats

- **MCP `handle_get_causal_chain` returned an empty-but-valid-looking response when both `CausalChainAnalyzer` and the graph fallback were unavailable** (#781, #817) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - Returns an explicit `{"error": "Causal chain analysis is not supported on this graph backend", "chain": []}` instead of `{"chain": [], "count": 0, "direction": ...}`, letting clients distinguish "unsupported" from a legitimately empty chain
  - The fallback path now introspects `graph.get_causal_chain`'s signature to forward `direction`/`max_depth` (or a `depth` kwarg, or nothing, depending on what the backend accepts) instead of always calling with just `decision_id`, matching the primary analyzer path's behavior
  - Hardened input handling: non-dict `args`, non-string `decision_id` (previously a latent `AttributeError` on `.strip()`), and `max_depth` clamped to `(0, 100]` with a safe default on invalid input
  - Added `tests/test_mcp_decisions_causal_chain.py` (11 tests) covering the unsupported-backend, fallback-forwarding, and validation/exception paths across multiple backend signature shapes
  - **Follow-up review fix**: the signature-detection try/except previously caught the *actual call*'s exceptions in the same block used for introspection failures, so a genuine bug inside a backend's `get_causal_chain` (raising an unrelated `TypeError`) was misread as a signature mismatch and the backend was invoked a second time with identical arguments before the real error surfaced. Signature introspection and the resulting call are now split into separate try/excepts so a successfully-introspected call is made exactly once; added `test_internal_typeerror_calls_backend_only_once` to lock this in

- **`ProvenanceManager.track_entity` persisted partial history and returned fabricated entries on storage failure** (#782, #816) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - `track_entity()`'s two-step write (history archive + primary update) is now atomic — if either write fails, the whole operation rolls back via the existing #807 `transaction()` mechanism, instead of silently persisting a partial state
  - `track_entity()`'s return type is now `Optional[ProvenanceEntry]`: on failure it returns a safe deep copy of the pre-failure existing entry (if one existed) or `None` (if this was a brand-new, never-successfully-tracked entity) — never a fabricated object claiming values that were never actually persisted
  - This is a behavior change for callers that inspect the return value without checking for `None` first — audited: 0 of 47 production call sites in the repo currently dereference the return value, so this is safe today, but any NEW caller must handle `None`
  - `InMemoryStorage` gained real transactional rollback (staging-buffer based) to match this guarantee — previously `transaction()` was a no-op

- **`ProvenanceManager` duplicated the same checksum/persist/exception-swallow block across 4 tracking methods** (#784, #815) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - Consolidated the repeated `entry.checksum = compute_checksum(entry)` / `try: self.storage.store(entry) except Exception: pass` block used by `track_entity`, `track_relationship`, `track_chunk`, and `track_property_source` into a single `ProvenanceManager._save_entry()` helper, preserving the existing graceful-failure behavior and the batch `_conn`/re-raise semantics from #807
  - Added 4 regression tests (`tests/provenance/test_manager.py`) covering storage-failure swallowing for each of the four tracking methods, none of which had coverage for this path before
  - **Follow-up review fix**: the initial refactor of `track_entity`'s exception fallback (the branch that runs when a failure happens *before* the entry is built, e.g. a retrieve error inside the atomic transaction) routed through `_save_entry()`, which made a new `self.storage.store(entry)` call outside the already-failed transaction — a real behavioral change from the original code (which only computed a checksum on that path) that could have reintroduced the exact race #807's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction serialization was meant to prevent. Reverted that branch to only compute the checksum, and added `test_track_entity_pre_build_failure_fallback_skips_store` asserting `storage.store` is never called on that path

- **`SQLiteStorage` and `ProvenanceManager` connection churn, non-atomic writes, and batch tracking overhead** (#807) by @Sameer6305
  - Scoped a single SQLite connection to the full duration of each public storage method call (`track_entity()`, `store()`, `retrieve_all()`, `clear()`) instead of opening independent connections per internal SQL statement, reducing connection churn by ~67% while closing the handle before the public method returns to preserve Windows filesystem unlink safety
  - Implemented the `SQLiteStorage.transaction()` context manager with Write-Ahead Logging (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`), `busy_timeout=5000`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, and immediate write transactions (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`), ensuring concurrent read-modify-write sequences (including history version ID generation) are serialized without lock contention or data loss
  - Added block-level transaction sharing to `track_entities_batch()` and `track_chunks_batch()`, reducing SQLite commit overhead by ~99.9% for large batches and deferring `tracked_count` increments until successful commit so rolled-back items are never reported as successes
  - Preserved 100% backward compatibility for custom storage backends overriding `trace_lineage(self, entity_id)` by inspecting signatures dynamically before passing `max_depth`, and optimized BFS lineage queries with batched IN-clause lookups per frontier level
  - **Follow-up fix**: `retrieve()` and `trace_lineage()` were initially routed through `transaction()` too, so plain reads took the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` writer lock as read-modify-write calls, serializing every read behind every other read/write and defeating the WAL concurrency this PR was meant to add. They now use a dedicated `_read_connection()` (configured, no explicit `BEGIN`) so reads no longer contend for the writer lock
  - **Follow-up fix**: `track_entity()`/`track_chunk()` caught all internal storage exceptions unconditionally, so when called from `track_entities_batch()`/`track_chunks_batch()`'s shared per-block transaction, a single item's storage failure (e.g. non-JSON-serializable metadata) was swallowed inside the call and never surfaced to the batch loop's per-item `except`, inflating `tracked_count` for entries that were never persisted. Both methods now re-raise when invoked with a shared `_conn` (batch context) while still degrading gracefully on standalone calls, so batch counts match what's actually committed
  - Added 8 dedicated regression tests in `tests/provenance/test_sqlite_storage_performance_807.py` covering PRAGMA configuration, Windows unlink safety, batch transaction sharing, BFS `max_depth`, rollback count accuracy, custom storage backward compatibility, concurrent read-modify-write serialization, and connection cleanup guards on configuration error

- **Closed remaining `ProvenanceManager` storage-failure test-coverage gaps identified by a #785 audit** (#785)
  - An audit of `tests/provenance/` (filed against a claim that zero tests exercised `storage.store()` failures) found #782/#783/#784/#807 had already closed most of the gap, but two residual surfaces had no test: `track_relationship()`, `track_chunk()`, and `track_property_source()`'s storage-failure-swallowing contract (returns `None`, logs, persists nothing) was only verified against `InMemoryStorage`, never `SQLiteStorage`; and `track_chunks_batch()` had no test for per-item `_save_entry` failure logging or for the block-level transaction-failure log message, even though `track_entities_batch()` had both
  - No production code changed — #782/#783/#784/#807 already implemented the correct behavior; this closes the coverage gap proving it holds on both backends
  - Added `test_track_relationship_storage_error_swallowed_sqlite`, `test_track_chunk_storage_error_swallowed_sqlite`, `test_track_property_source_storage_error_swallowed_sqlite`, `test_chunks_batch_logs_per_item_failure_memory`, and `test_track_chunks_batch_block_level_transaction_failure_logs` to `tests/provenance/test_manager.py`
  - Read-path failure coverage (`get_lineage()`/`trace_lineage()`/`get_provenance()`/`clear()` propagating a raised storage exception) remains untested and is a candidate for a follow-up issue, since none of those methods currently wrap the underlying storage call in a try/except

- **Explorer's Provenance UI used a naive 2-hop graph traversal instead of the audit-grade `ProvenanceManager` backend** (#792, #809) by @Sameer6305
  - `semantica/explorer/routes/provenance.py` never imported or called `ProvenanceManager` (`semantica/provenance/manager.py`); `/api/provenance` and `/api/provenance/report` built their lineage response entirely from a naive 2-hop networkx traversal over the live graph instead of querying the SQLite-backed, checksummed audit log. Both endpoints now query `session.provenance_manager.get_lineage(node_id)` first, and a new `_transform_audit_lineage()` maps the W3C PROV-O entries into the exact `{"nodes": [...], "edges": [...]}` shape `LineageDiagram.tsx` already expects — no frontend changes required
  - Falls back to the original 2-hop traversal, never a 500: no audit records for a node, a `ProvenanceManager` storage failure (corrupted DB, permissions), or a failed SHA-256 integrity check on any entry in the lineage chain all degrade cleanly to the naive path. A new `source: "audit" | "graph_traversal"` field on the response discloses which path actually served the data
  - `ProvenanceManager.get_lineage()` now returns `integrity_verified`, computed by re-verifying every entry's checksum before it's trusted; a single tampered or corrupted entry anywhere in the lineage chain now falls the *entire* response back to graph traversal rather than serving partially-verified audit data
  - Replaced an initial classmethod-based `ProvenanceManager.set_default_storage_path()` approach (caught in review before merge — it would have let any two sessions/apps in the same process silently share and overwrite each other's storage path, including across unrelated test runs) with `provenance_storage_path` threaded through `GraphSession.__init__` and `create_app(...)`, so each session's `ProvenanceManager` is independently scoped
  - Disclosed limitation: `ProvenanceManager.trace_lineage()`/`get_lineage()` only walk `parent_entity_id`/`used_entities` backward, so the audit path currently surfaces upstream lineage only — the naive fallback remains the only source for downstream/descendant relationships until `ProvenanceManager` gains a reverse lookup
  - New `tests/explorer/test_provenance_manager_wiring.py` (8 tests): the audit path via a real multi-hop `track_entity()` chain, empty-record fallback, simulated storage-failure degradation (asserts `200`, not `500`), checksum-tamper fallback, evidence-field preservation, `create_app()` storage-path wiring, and cross-session storage isolation, confirmed order-invariant across `tests/explorer/` and `tests/provenance/` in both execution orders

- **`POST /shacl/validate` and the `/health` SHACL dimension never ran live SHACL validation** (#772, #804) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - `/shacl/validate` had no data graph to validate submitted shapes against — only a Turtle syntax check. Added `_data_graph_turtle_for_uri()`, which serializes the loaded ontology's nodes/edges into an RDF/Turtle instance graph (CURIE resolution across owl/rdfs/skos/dct/dc, arbitrary node-property projection, typed individuals) and wires both `/shacl/validate` and the `/health` SHACL dimension to `OntologyEngine.validate_graph()` via pySHACL, returning real `conforms`/violations instead of a hardcoded `status="unavailable"` stub
  - Fixed a cross-ontology namespace leak in `_node_belongs_to_ontology`: its prefix fallback (`_extract_namespace()`) split only on the last `/`, so sibling ontologies sharing a domain (e.g. `.../onto-a` and `.../onto-b`) could match entities across ontologies that shouldn't be related; fixed by comparing against the full URI stem via the new `_ontology_namespace()` helper
  - Added resource guardrails to `/shacl/validate` to close a DoS risk flagged in review: a submitted-Turtle byte cap (`SEMANTICA_MAX_SHACL_TURTLE_BYTES`, default 256 KB), a parsed-triple cap (`SEMANTICA_MAX_SHACL_TRIPLES`, default 1,000), a validation timeout (`SEMANTICA_MAX_SHACL_TIMEOUT`, default 15s), and a global concurrency semaphore (`SEMANTICA_MAX_SHACL_CONCURRENCY`, default 4)
  - Fixed `HealthDimension.status` being set to `"error"` on a real (non-`ImportError`) validation exception, which isn't a valid value on that model — Pydantic construction raised and turned the whole `/health` endpoint into a 422 on any real bug; now reports `status="critical"` (already a valid value) with a regression test forcing this exact path
  - Follow-up review fixes: reverted an unrelated regression that had crept into this PR — `POST /api/ontology/create` had gone back to silently swallowing `OntologyEngine.from_data`/`from_text` failures into a near-empty "minimal" ontology instead of raising `HTTPException(500)`, undoing the earlier #770/#787 fix for the same endpoint (and breaking `TestOntologyCreateFailures`, which wasn't run before this PR's initial merge request); `sh:Warning`/`sh:Info`-severity pySHACL results were silently dropped from the `/shacl/validate` response — a shape using non-`Violation` severities could report `conforms=False` with an empty `violations` list and no explanation, so warnings/infos are now folded into the response's `violations` array; and `/health` was independently re-fetching and re-truncation-checking the same ontology's nodes/edges once for the generated SHACL shapes and once for the data graph — both now share a single fetch via `_fetch_analysis_graph()`
  - New regression tests: `TestOntologyCreateFailures` (pre-existing, now passing again), `test_shacl_validate_surfaces_warning_severity_results`, `test_health_dedupes_node_edge_fetch`, plus the existing 26-test `tests/explorer/test_ontology_subissue3.py` suite (28/28 passing) and the pre-existing `tests/ontology/` suite (83/83 passing)

- **Neptune cookbook CloudFormation stack exposed the database port to the entire internet and had no network audit trail** ([code scanning alert #28](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/28), [#26](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/26), [#27](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/27), `AC_AWS_0276`/`AC_AWS_0369`/`AC_AWS_0148`) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `cookbook/introduction/neptune-setup.yaml`'s security group let anyone on `0.0.0.0/0` reach the Neptune Bolt/OpenCypher port (8182); it now requires a `ClientCidr` parameter (CIDR-validated, no default) so the stack can't be created without the deployer explicitly scoping access to their own IP or VPN/office range
  - Added `AWS::EC2::FlowLog` plus a dedicated CloudWatch Logs group and IAM role so all traffic in the stack's VPC is now logged
  - Left the account-wide IAM password policy check (`AC_AWS_0148`) unimplemented as a stack resource on purpose: `AWS::IAM::AccountPasswordPolicy` is an account singleton, and wiring it into a disposable per-learner tutorial stack would mean creating or deleting this stack also mutates or removes the account's real password policy — suppressed with a documented `ts:skip=AC_AWS_0148` explaining why, rather than "fixed"
  - Updated `21_Amazon_Neptune_Store.ipynb`'s `aws cloudformation create-stack` instructions, prerequisites, and cost table to match the new required `ClientCidr` parameter and flow-log line item

- **Follow-up to the knowledge-explorer Helm chart default-namespace/seccomp scanner findings reopening** ([code scanning alert #846](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/846), [#847](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/847), [#848](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/848), [#68](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/68), [#63](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/63), `CKV_K8S_21`/`AC_K8S_0086`/`AC_K8S_0080`) by @KaifAhmad1
  - The `checkov.io/skip1` metadata annotation added previously (see the `CKV_K8S_21` entry below) evidently isn't being honored by the Microsoft Defender for DevOps scan — the same finding reopened under new alert numbers on the current `main`. Added the more standard `# checkov:skip=CKV_K8S_21` and `# ts:skip=AC_K8S_0086` inline comments at the top of `templates/deployment.yaml`, `templates/service.yaml`, and `templates/configmap.yaml` as a second suppression path (matching the convention already used in `deploy/gcp/cloudrun-service.yaml`), plus `# ts:skip=AC_K8S_0080` on `templates/deployment.yaml` for the seccomp finding, which trips for the same root cause: terrascan's static template scan never resolves `{{ toYaml .Values.podSecurityContext }}`, even though `values.yaml` sets `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault` correctly
  - Confirmed the `deploy/kubernetes/*` (non-Helm) manifests already had TLS and seccomp configured correctly, so no code change was needed there for the corresponding alerts (#61 and the non-Helm seccomp finding) — expected to close on the next scan
  - Documented both suppression mechanisms and the reasoning in `.checkov.yaml`
  - Residual risk: this environment could not run checkov/terrascan locally to confirm the inline comments are actually honored during a Helm-rendered scan; if the alerts are still open after the next scan, the reliable fallback is splitting the CI checkov/terrascan invocation so `deploy/helm/` is scanned with these specific checks excluded via `--skip-check` instead of relying on in-file suppression

- **`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` cascading renders across 12 Explorer workspace files** (#769, #796) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - Replaced synchronous `setState` calls inside `useEffect` bodies with React's recommended "adjust state during render" pattern (`if (x !== prevX) { setPrevX(x); ...setState... }`) across `OntologyWorkspace`, `ManageWorkspace`, `LineageWorkspace`, and `GraphWorkspace`, and inlined async data-fetching effects with `ignore` flags to prevent race conditions and stale writes after unmount
  - Fixed a regression the inlining itself introduced: `AlignmentsTab.tsx`, `KGOverviewTab.tsx`, `OntologyManager.tsx`, and `VersionsTab.tsx` each duplicated their existing fetch callback (`reload` / `fetchOverview` / `fetchRegistry` / `loadVersions`+`loadProposals`) into a second, inline copy for the mount effect, and the copy silently dropped the `setError`/`flashMsg` calls the original had — re-introducing, on the very first page load, the exact error-swallowing behavior that #767/#790 had already fixed for these same files. The inline copies now mirror the original's error handling (including `207` partial-success messages) exactly
  - Fixed `LineageDiagram.tsx` only clearing the previously-rendered nodes/edges when the new `activeId` was falsy instead of on every id change, so switching directly between two lineage views briefly kept showing the *previous* view's stale diagram instead of clearing before the new fetch resolved
  - `GraphWorkspace.tsx` and `GraphLoadingOverlay.tsx` still have unrelated `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` violations outside this PR's 12-file scope (confirmed via `npx eslint .`); left as follow-up work rather than expanding this PR further

- **Checkov flagged the knowledge-explorer Helm chart for using the default Kubernetes namespace** ([code scanning alert #779](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/779), [#778](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/778), [#777](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/777), `CKV_K8S_21`) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `templates/service.yaml`, `templates/deployment.yaml`, and `templates/configmap.yaml` all already set `metadata.namespace` to `{{ .Release.Namespace }}`, which is only bound at `helm install`/`helm template` time; Checkov's helm framework renders the chart without a namespace override, so it always resolves to `default` and trips `CKV_K8S_21` even though the chart is namespace-agnostic by design
  - Added a `checkov.io/skip1: CKV_K8S_21` metadata annotation to each of the three files to suppress the scanner artifact false-positive properly in Helm templates, and documented the reasoning in `.checkov.yaml`

- **No React error boundaries around lazy-loaded Explorer workspaces — a single render error crashed the whole app** (#768, #794) by @Sameer6305
  - Added an `ErrorBoundary` class component (`explorer/src/ErrorBoundary.tsx`) and wrapped each lazy-loaded workspace's `<Suspense>` block in `App.tsx` with it, keyed on the active sub-view so navigating away from and back to a crashed tab remounts it cleanly
  - Failed retries are capped at 3 before the fallback UI switches from "Try Again" to a "Reload Application" dead-end, preventing infinite retry loops on deterministic crashes; raw error/stack details are logged via `console.error` only and never rendered into the fallback UI
  - Fixed the retry counter so it resets after a retry actually succeeds and stays error-free for a few seconds, instead of never resetting (which could permanently exhaust the retry budget on unrelated, individually-recoverable transient errors) or resetting on the very next commit (which could fire prematurely while `Suspense` was still showing its fallback)

- **Explorer frontend workspaces silently swallowed network/server errors** (#767, #790) by @Sameer6305
  - `ShaclStudio.tsx`, `VersionsTab.tsx`, `SKOSVocabularyManager.tsx`, `EntityResolutionTab.tsx`, `LineageDiagram.tsx`, `DecisionWorkspace.tsx`, `KGOverviewTab.tsx`, `OntologyManager.tsx`, `OntologySearch.tsx`, `ReasoningWorkspace.tsx`, and `SparqlWorkspace.tsx` now render a visible error banner instead of only `console.error()`-ing failed fetches
  - Added explicit `response.status === 207` (Multi-Status) handling across these workspaces so partial backend failures surface a warning instead of reading as a full success (`response.ok` is `true` for all 2xx codes, including 207)
  - Added defensive JSON parsing so an unexpected non-JSON (e.g. HTML 500) response body no longer crashes the app with `SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON`
  - Fixed `KGOverviewTab.tsx` dropping the `/api/graph/nodes` partial-success warning whenever `/api/graph/stats` also returned 207 — both warnings are now shown (appended) instead of one being silently discarded
  - Fixed `HealthTab.tsx`'s registry load still using a bare `.catch(() => {})` that swallowed errors identically to the pattern fixed elsewhere in this same folder; failures now populate the existing error banner
  - Fixed `AlignmentsTab.tsx`'s `reload()` using `Promise.allSettled` but never handling the `"rejected"` branches for the registry/alignments fetches, so both failures previously vanished with no error surfaced and no logging

- **`tests/explorer/test_explorer_api.py` failed with `TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'app'` on current httpx** (#788, #789) by @Sameer6305
  - `httpx>=0.28.0` removed the `app=` kwarg that Starlette's `TestClient` relies on to wrap a FastAPI app for testing; `httpx` wasn't pinned anywhere in `pyproject.toml`, so different environments could independently resolve an incompatible transitive version and hit the same break
  - Added an explicit `httpx<0.28.0` constraint to the main `[project.dependencies]` array (not just a dev extra), so it applies globally across production, dev, and CI installs
  - Without the pin, the full test suite fails to even complete collection (fails immediately on `tests/explorer/test_vocabulary.py` with the same `TestClient` error); with it, `tests/explorer/test_explorer_api.py` goes from 7 failed/12 passed/58 errors to 77 passed, 0 errors

- **Explorer backend routes returned HTTP 200 with error/empty bodies on failure, defeating frontend error handling** (#770, #787) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - `GET /api/temporal/patterns` now raises `HTTPException(500)` on a genuine computation failure instead of silently returning an empty-but-valid `TemporalPatternResponse`; the `ImportError` fallback (optional `kg` extra not installed) is unchanged and still degrades gracefully to an empty list
  - `POST /api/ontology/create` now raises `HTTPException(500)` when ontology generation fails in either the `sample_data` or `schema_text` mode, instead of silently falling back to a partial/minimal ontology with a misleading `nodes_added` count
  - `GET /api/analytics` sets `response.status_code = 207` (Multi-Status) when some, but not all, of the requested metrics fail, and raises `HTTPException(500)` when every requested metric fails — a plain 2xx (including 207) reads as success to callers that only check `response.ok`, so an all-failed request now surfaces as a hard error rather than a body full of `{"error": ...}`
  - Added regression tests covering all three failure paths (`test_patterns_failure_returns_500`, `test_analytics_partial_failure_returns_207`, `test_analytics_total_failure_returns_500`, and two `TestOntologyCreateFailures` cases)

### Security

- **CI/CD supply-chain hardening against mutable-tag Action compromise (LiteLLM/Trivy-class attack)** (#824) by @KaifAhmad1
  - Every third-party GitHub Action across all 8 workflows is now pinned to a full commit SHA instead of a mutable tag (`@v7` → `@3d3c42e... # v7`), closing the exact vector used against LiteLLM in March 2026 (a compromised Trivy Action tag stole a long-lived publishing token)
  - Added `verify-action-pins.yml` + `.github/scripts/verify-action-pins.sh`: a CI check that fails closed on any `uses:` reference that isn't a full SHA (catching a newly introduced mutable tag, not just auditing existing pins) and re-verifies every pin against the GitHub API on each workflow change, on push to `main`, and weekly; an unresolvable API lookup is treated as a failure rather than a silent skip
  - `release.yml`: scoped `permissions` to the job level (workflow default is now `contents: read`), added a `concurrency` group so simultaneous tag pushes can't race the publish job, and added SLSA build provenance attestation (`actions/attest-build-provenance`) for every released wheel
  - Created a protected `pypi` GitHub Environment (required reviewer, restricted to `v*` tag deployments) and enabled branch protection on `main` (required PR review with stale-approval dismissal, required status checks, no force-push/deletion, required conversation resolution) — PyPI publishing already used Trusted Publishing (OIDC) with no long-lived token
  - Grouped Dependabot's `github-actions` updates into a single PR

- **`security-scan.yml`'s Safety dependency-vulnerability check was silently non-functional** (#824) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `safety check --json --output safety-report.json` is invalid in Safety 3.x (`--output` now selects a console format, not a file path); the command errored on every run, swallowed by `|| true`, so no report was ever produced and the job always fell back to a generic "scan completed" message with the vulnerability count hardcoded to 0
  - Switched to `--save-json`, the correct flag for writing a JSON report to disk; also fixed `vuln.package` → `vuln.package_name` and Semgrep's `issue.rule_id` → `issue.check_id` (both produced `undefined` in the PR comment)
  - The job never installed Semantica's own dependencies before scanning, so Safety was auditing the scanner tools' own transitive deps, not the project's; added `pip install -e ".[llm-litellm]"` so the actual dependency tree — including the LiteLLM extra — is what gets scanned
  - Rewrote the PR-comment builder: every line previously used `\\n` inside JS template literals, which renders as the literal text `\n` rather than a newline, producing an unreadable wall of text; now builds real line arrays and collapses long finding lists into a `<details>` block
  - Added the `pull-requests: write` permission the comment-posting step was missing (silently failing via its own try/catch on every prior run)

- **`pypdf2==3.0.1` removed (CVE-2023-36464)** (#824) by @KaifAhmad1
  - Surfaced by the Safety fix above: PyPDF2 is a discontinued project (merged into `pypdf`) permanently frozen at the vulnerable 3.0.1 with no patched release possible. `grep -rn "import PyPDF2"` found zero real usages anywhere in the codebase — it was only referenced in docstrings describing a `PyPDF2.PdfReader()` fallback for PDF parsing that was never actually implemented (`pdfplumber` does the real work). Removed the dependency and corrected the stale docstrings in `parse/__init__.py`, `parse/methods.py`, `parse/pdf_parser.py`, and `ingest/email_ingestor.py`

- **10 Bandit B324 false positives suppressed (non-cryptographic MD5 use)** (#824) by @KaifAhmad1
  - Surfaced by the same Safety fix restoring a working CI gate: Bandit's HIGH-severity check was blocking on 10 pre-existing `hashlib.md5()` calls, all generating short deterministic cache keys, entity IDs, or IRI suffixes from non-secret input — none used for passwords, tokens, or verifying untrusted data
  - Bandit's own message suggests `usedforsecurity=False`, but that keyword argument needs Python 3.9+ and `pyproject.toml` declares `requires-python = ">=3.8"`; used a targeted `# nosec B324` with a one-line justification instead, which suppresses only this check with no runtime behavior change on any supported Python version

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Named-graph support for `JenaStore` via `Dataset` migration** (#756, #757) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - `JenaStore` now backs onto `rdflib.Dataset(default_union=False)` instead of `rdflib.Graph`, closing #756 and fully closing out the #754/#756 cross-backend named-graph parity effort across Blazegraph, RDF4J, and Jena
  - `default_union=False` is explicitly set so existing `execute_sparql()`/`get_triplets()` calls that don't pass `graph=` keep seeing only the default graph, not a union across all named graphs
  - `add_triplets()` accepts a `graph=` option: when supplied, triples are written to that named graph (4-tuple add via `Dataset.graph(uri)`); when omitted, behavior is unchanged (3-tuple add routes to the default graph)
  - Fixed a pre-existing bug where the remote-endpoint path instantiated the read-only rdflib `SPARQLStore` instead of `SPARQLUpdateStore`, so every `add_triplets()` call against a remote Fuseki endpoint silently failed (`TypeError` swallowed, `success=True`/`added=0` returned); also fixed a constructor bug where `self.endpoint` was always `None` regardless of how `JenaStore` was called, making the remote path unreachable in practice
  - `serialize()` now logs a warning instead of silently dropping named-graph content when the requested format (`turtle`, `xml`, `n3`, …) can only serialize the default graph; use `format="trig"` or `format="nquads"` to include all graphs
  - `create_model()`'s `triplet_count` now documented as counting across all graphs (default + named), not just the default graph, matching the `Dataset`-wide semantics
  - `delete_triplet()` remains scoped to the default graph only (named-graph parity for delete is an explicit follow-up, matching the maintainer's scoping of this migration to `add_triplets`); the removal is passed `self.graph.default_graph` explicitly as its context, since `Dataset.remove()` on a bare 3-tuple resolves to a wildcard context internally and would otherwise delete matching triples out of every named graph too — a follow-up fix to the initial PR #757 for a bug that had no test coverage
  - 9 new tests covering `Dataset` construction, `default_union=False` confirmation, named-graph write isolation, `serialize()` warning behavior, and `delete_triplet()`'s default-graph scoping

- **SPARQL CONSTRUCT query templates** (#752, #322, #755, #754) by @Sameer6305
  - Added parameterized, injection-safe `CONSTRUCT` templates (`ConstructTemplate`, `ParameterDescriptor`, `ConstructTemplateRegistry`)
  - Extended CONSTRUCT execution support from Blazegraph-only to the RDF4J and Jena backends (#755), closing #754
    - `RDF4JStore.execute_sparql` gains a CONSTRUCT-aware path (`Accept: text/turtle`, rdflib Turtle parsing, the same `(s, p, o, metadata)` 4-tuple contract) and named-graph writes via RDF4J's REST `context` parameter
    - `JenaStore.execute_sparql` gains the equivalent CONSTRUCT-aware path over its in-process `rdflib.Graph`
    - `_CONSTRUCT_QUERY_RE` moved to `sparql_escaping.py` as a shared, backend-agnostic constant used by all three backends
  - Added pipeline integration via the `construct_template` step type

- **Databricks Connector (Unity Catalog + Delta Lake ingestion)** (#747) by @KaifAhmad1
  - Added `DatabricksIngestor` (`semantica/ingest/databricks_ingestor.py`), mirroring `SnowflakeIngestor`'s structure and public API shape: a `DatabricksConnector` connection handler, a `DatabricksData` dataclass, and an optional-import guard for `databricks-sdk`/`databricks-sql-connector`
  - Supports personal access token and OAuth M2M (service principal `client_id`/`client_secret`) authentication, configurable via constructor args or `DATABRICKS_*` environment variables
  - `ingest_table()`/`ingest_query()` run against a SQL warehouse or cluster via `databricks-sql-connector`, with `where`/`order_by`/`limit`/`offset` support and the same identifier-escaping and unsafe-`ORDER BY` rejection as `SnowflakeIngestor`; each call closes the SQL connection it opened unless one is already open (e.g. via the `with DatabricksIngestor(...)` context manager), which reuses and closes it exactly once instead of leaking a second connection per call
  - `get_table_schema()`, `list_catalogs()`, `list_schemas()`, and `list_tables()` introspect Unity Catalog via `databricks-sdk`'s `WorkspaceClient`, validating both catalog and schema are resolved before calling the SDK; `get_table_lineage()` calls Unity Catalog's table-lineage REST API for upstream/downstream `Table --DEPENDS_ON--> Table` dependencies, plus an opt-in `include_column_lineage=True` that resolves per-column lineage via the column-lineage API
  - `export_as_documents()` converts ingested rows into Semantica document dicts for KG construction, matching `SnowflakeIngestor.export_as_documents()`'s shape
  - Registered as a lazy export in `semantica.ingest` (`DatabricksIngestor`, `DatabricksData`, `DatabricksConnector`) and as the `db-databricks` optional extra (`pip install "semantica[db-databricks]"`) in `pyproject.toml`, included in `db-all`
  - New `docs/integrations/databricks.md` page modeled on `docs/integrations/snowflake.md`, plus a `DatabricksIngestor` section and table row in `docs/reference/ingest.md` and cross-links between the two integration pages
  - 35 unit tests in `tests/test_databricks_ingestor.py` covering both auth methods, table/query ingestion, connection lifecycle (including reuse under the context manager), pagination, unsafe `ORDER BY` rejection, catalog/schema validation, schema/catalog/table listing, table and column lineage, document export, and the missing-dependency error path, closing #747

- **SQLite Vector Store Backend (`sqlite-vec`)** (#726) by @Luffy2208 and @KaifAhmad1
  - Added `SQLiteVecStore` (`semantica/vector_store/sqlite_vec_store.py`), a disk-backed local vector store using the `sqlite-vec` extension's `vec0` virtual tables, closing #240
  - Supports Cosine and L2 distance metrics, dynamic JSON metadata filtering, read-only mode, and an in-memory (`:memory:`) mode
  - Registered as the `"sqlite"` backend in `VectorStore.SUPPORTED_BACKENDS`, with `db_path`/`sqlite_path` config and a `VECTOR_STORE_SQLITE_PATH` environment variable
  - Batched `add`/`delete`/`get` and `executemany`-based `update` to avoid per-row round trips; optional `use_wal=True` enables `journal_mode=WAL` + `synchronous=NORMAL` for improved write concurrency
  - Lazy-imports `sqlite-vec` so the dependency stays fully optional (`pip install semantica[vectorstore-sqlite]`); table names and metadata filter keys are validated against a strict identifier pattern before SQL interpolation
  - Fixes `VectorStore.update_vectors`/`delete_vectors` to delegate to the active backend store instead of only mutating in-memory state, correcting existing behavior for all non-`inmemory` backends
  - 25 unit and integration tests in `tests/vector_store/test_sqlite_vec_store.py` covering init, add, search, get, update, delete, read-only mode, and stats

### Fixed

- **`kg.ProvenanceTracker` compatibility wrapper out of sync with `ProvenanceManager`, causing 9 pre-existing test failures** (#744, #751) by @Sameer6305 and @KaifAhmad1
  - `kg.ProvenanceTracker` was a standalone in-memory implementation that never delegated to the unified `ProvenanceManager` backend; its own test suite asserted the existence of `get_lineage`, `track_relationship`, `track_entities_batch`, `get_provenance`, and `_use_unified`, none of which were ever implemented, plus a stale `get_all_sources()` assertion expecting `"timestamp"` instead of the actual `"recorded_at"` key
  - Rather than completing the abandoned compatibility layer, `kg.ProvenanceTracker` and its remaining supported methods (`track_entity`, `get_all_sources`, `query_recorded_between`, `revision_history`, `export_audit_log`) now emit `DeprecationWarning`s pointing callers to `semantica.provenance.ProvenanceManager`
  - Removed/rewrote the 9 tests that only exercised the never-implemented compatibility methods to instead verify the observable behavior of the still-supported API, and corrected the stale `get_all_sources()` assertion
  - Added the previously-missing `docs/migration/kg-provenance-tracker.md` migration guide referenced by every new deprecation warning, with a method-mapping table to `ProvenanceManager` and a before/after example, closing #744

- **`ProvenanceManager.track_entity` silently overrides an explicit `parent_entity_id`/`derived_from` on re-track** (#742) by @Sameer6305
  - `track_entity()` resolved `parent_id` via a documented precedence chain (`parent_entity_id` kwarg > `metadata["derived_from"]` > source-as-known-entity-id fallback), but the history-preservation block that runs afterward unconditionally overwrote that resolved value with an auto-generated `f"{entity_id}:v:{existing.last_updated}"` history pointer whenever the entity was being re-tracked, discarding whatever parent the caller had just explicitly supplied with no warning
  - `track_entity()` now records whether the precedence chain already resolved an explicit parent (`parent_entity_id` kwarg, `metadata["derived_from"]`, or the source-as-known-entity-id fallback) before the history block runs, and only falls back to the auto-generated history pointer when the caller supplied no explicit parent on that call
  - The archived history entry for the previous version is still kept reachable in `get_lineage()` via `used_entities` (BFS-traversed by `InMemoryStorage.trace_lineage()`) even when an explicit parent is supplied, so re-tracking with a new parent no longer orphans the prior version from the lineage chain; when no explicit parent is supplied, `used_entities` is left alone since `parent_entity_id` already points at the same history id, avoiding a duplicate self-reference
  - Added `test_retrack_with_explicit_parent_overrides_history_link`, `test_retrack_without_explicit_parent_still_uses_history_link`, `test_retrack_with_derived_from_overrides_history_link`, and `test_retrack_history_reachable_via_used_entities` regression tests, closing #742

- **`ProvenanceManager.get_lineage` does not link entities that share a source URL** (#735) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `track_entity()`'s only auto-linking logic looked up `source` as if it were an existing entity's `entity_id`, so passing the same real URL/DOI as `source` for two conceptually linked entities (e.g. a document and a decision derived from it) never produced a parent link, leaving `get_lineage()` returning a chain of length 1
  - `metadata["derived_from"]` was preserved and echoed back in the output JSON but was never consulted by any linking or traversal code, so the caller's explicit relationship was silently inert
  - `track_entity()` now treats `metadata["derived_from"]` as an explicit parent link (unless `parent_entity_id` was already passed directly), so `InMemoryStorage.trace_lineage()`'s existing BFS over `parent_entity_id` picks it up for free
  - `metadata["derived_from"]` is now recognized on any `collections.abc.Mapping`, not just a concrete `dict`, so e.g. `types.MappingProxyType` metadata still creates the parent link
  - `get_lineage()`'s metadata aggregation now applies the queried entity's own metadata last so it wins over ancestor metadata on conflicting keys, matching the documented "most recent entry's metadata takes precedence" behavior — previously `trace_lineage()`'s BFS order caused ancestor metadata (now reachable via `derived_from` chains) to silently overwrite the queried entity's own values
  - Added 9 regression/edge-case tests in `tests/provenance/test_manager.py` covering the happy path, explicit `parent_entity_id` precedence over `derived_from`, precedence over the `source`-as-known-entity-id fallback, a `derived_from` pointing at a never-tracked entity, non-string/empty-string `derived_from` values being ignored, a self-referencing `derived_from` not hanging traversal, multi-hop `derived_from` chains, metadata precedence between a queried entity and its ancestors, and non-`dict` `Mapping` metadata, closing #735

- **`Reasoner.add_rule` had no deduplication, doubling rules and silently emptying `forward_chain()` on rerun** (#732) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `add_rule()` unconditionally appended to `self.rules`, so re-running the same setup code on an existing `Reasoner` instance (e.g. re-executing a Jupyter cell) duplicated every rule; since `forward_chain()` only records a conclusion if it isn't already in `self.facts`, the second run's duplicated rules matched but produced no new results, with no error or warning
  - `add_rule()` now compares an incoming rule's `rule_type`, `conditions`, and `conclusion` against existing rules and returns the existing `Rule` instead of appending a duplicate, keeping repeated `add_rule()` calls with the same definition idempotent
  - Added `test_add_rule_deduplicates_identical_rule`, `test_add_rule_deduplication_is_idempotent_across_forward_chain`, and `test_add_rule_does_not_dedupe_distinct_rules` regression tests

- **`InferenceResult.premises` always empty from `forward_chain`/`backward_chain`** (#739) by @Sameer6305
  - `_match_rule()` discarded matched facts and returned only instantiated conclusions, so `ExplanationGenerator` always produced empty premises lists regardless of which facts actually satisfied a rule, closing #733
  - `_match_rule()` now returns `(conclusion, matched_facts)` tuples; `forward_chain()` threads those facts into `InferenceResult(premises=...)`, merging premises when the same conclusion is derived more than once within a pass
  - `_prove_goal()`'s base cases (goal already a known fact; goal matched via pattern unification) now return `premises=[goal]`/`premises=[fact]` instead of `[]`
  - Facts are matched against a `sorted()` snapshot instead of the raw `set` so rule matching and premise selection are deterministic
  - Added `test_forward_chaining_premises` regression test mirroring the existing backward-chaining premises test

- **Missing `shacl` optional-dependency extra** (#736) by @Sameer6305
  - `pip install semantica[shacl]` referenced no matching extra in `pyproject.toml`, so `pyshacl` was never installed despite being documented as the fix in `ontology_validator.py`'s `ImportError` message, the Explorer API, the healthcare cookbook notebook, and the changelog
  - Added `shacl = ["pyshacl>=0.25.0"]` to `[project.optional-dependencies]` and folded `shacl` into the `all` extra

- **`NodeEmbedder` `AttributeError` masked in `ContextGraph.analyze_graph_with_kg`** (#734) by @Sameer6305
  - `analyze_graph_with_kg()` called a non-existent `NodeEmbedder.generate_embeddings()`, and the surrounding broad `except Exception` swallowed the resulting `AttributeError`, silently returning `{"error": "Graph analysis failed due to an internal error"}` from `get_causal_chain()`'s supporting analytics and `get_decision_insights()`
  - Rewired the call site to the real `NodeEmbedder.compute_embeddings(graph_store, node_labels, relationship_types)` API, deriving `node_labels`/`relationship_types` from `self.node_type_index`/`self.edge_type_index`
  - Added a dedicated `except AttributeError` branch that logs distinctly and re-raises, so a broken internal method call surfaces as a diagnosable error instead of being indistinguishable from a legitimately empty analysis result

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Apache Arrow & Feather File Ingestion** (#705) by @Luffy2208
  - Added `ArrowIngestor` (`semantica/ingest/arrow_ingestor.py`) for reading `.arrow`, `.feather`, and `.ipc` files via PyArrow
  - Supports Arrow IPC File format (random-access), Arrow IPC Stream format, Feather v1 and v2
  - Selective column reads, optional row limits, and batch-aware iteration that stops early without scanning the full file
  - `extract_schema()` and `extract_metadata()` convenience methods for schema/metadata inspection without reading row data
  - `_ArrowReaderWrapper` provides a unified interface across all three reader types, preventing stream exhaustion during schema inspection
  - `ingest_arrow()` convenience function and `ingest(..., source_type="arrow")` unified dispatch
  - Automatic Arrow format detection in `ingest()` by file extension (`.arrow`, `.feather`, `.ipc`) and by Arrow IPC magic bytes (`ARROW1\x00\x00`) in `FileTypeDetector`
  - Registry integration under the `arrow` task namespace with `file`, `schema`, and `metadata` methods
  - Lazy-import exports of `ArrowIngestor`, `ArrowData`, and `ingest_arrow` from `semantica.ingest`
  - Optional dependency group: `pip install semantica[ingest-arrow]`; included in `pip install semantica[all]`
  - 34 tests covering schema extraction, metadata inspection, row limits, column selection, multi-batch reading, IPC stream format, Feather ingestion, empty datasets, null values, magic-byte detection, and failure modes

- **Knowledge Explorer Deployment Templates** (#684) by @ZohaibHassan16 and @KaifAhmad1
  - Added `deploy/` directory with ready-to-use templates for 7 platforms, closing #681
  - **Docker** — fixed `Dockerfile` path (was broken on clean checkout), added non-root user, `HEALTHCHECK`, `.dockerignore`; fixed `docker-compose.yml` to start Explorer alongside FalkorDB on a shared network; added `docker-compose.dev.yml` with source volume-mounts for hot-reload (`docker compose up` brings up the full stack in one command)
  - **Railway** — `deploy/railway/railway.toml` with Dockerfile builder, healthcheck path, restart policy, and env vars wired from the Railway Redis plugin
  - **Render** — `deploy/render/render.yaml` Blueprint provisioning the web service and a Redis instance together with cross-linked env vars
  - **Fly.io** — `deploy/fly/fly.toml` with region, 512 MB VM, auto-stop, HTTP healthcheck, and a short README with four `flyctl` commands to deploy from zero
  - **GCP Cloud Run** — `deploy/gcp/cloudbuild.yaml` (build → push → deploy pipeline) and `deploy/gcp/cloudrun-service.yaml` (scale-to-zero, Secret Manager env vars, liveness probe)
  - **Azure Container Apps** — `deploy/azure/azure.yaml`, `main.bicep` (Container App + managed environment, HTTP ingress, HPA min 0 / max 10, liveness probe), and `main.parameters.json`; deployable with `azd up`
  - **Kubernetes + Helm** — raw manifests (`namespace`, `configmap`, `secret.example`, `deployment` with 2 replicas + rolling update, `service`, `ingress` with cert-manager TLS, `kustomization`); Helm chart with `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `values.prod.yaml`, HPA template, and `helm lint`-passing templates; all templates carry `namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}`
  - Added `/api/health` endpoint returning `{"status": "ok"}` used by all platform healthchecks
  - Wired `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `FALKORDB_HOST`, and `FALKORDB_PORT` from environment variables in `semantica/explorer/app.py`
  - Security hardened: non-root containers, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `NetworkPolicy` with explicit ingress/egress selectors, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`, capabilities dropped; secrets via `secret.yaml.example` templates only — no committed credentials

### Fixed

- **Arrow ingestion double full-scan on every data read** (#705) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `ingest_file` previously called `_file_metadata` (a full batch scan) before `_read_batches`, meaning every read scanned the entire file twice; for a `limit=1` read on a large file the metadata pass visited every batch while the data pass read only one; replaced with a single-pass `_read_batches_with_info` that collects batch metadata as a side effect of the data read; `_file_metadata` is now only invoked for `include_data=False`

- **Dead `num_record_batches` property on `_ArrowReaderWrapper` materialised all table batches** (#705) by @KaifAhmad1
  - The property was never called by production code but its `is_table` branch called `to_batches()` purely to take `len()`, materialising the entire table in memory just for a count; property removed

- **Arrow `_open_file` chained the wrong exception** (#705) by @KaifAhmad1
  - The fallback cascade (IPC file → IPC stream → Feather) raised `from feather_err`, surfacing the least diagnostic error in the Python traceback chain; changed to `from file_err` so the IPC file open error — the most informative signal for unrecognised formats — appears as `__cause__`

- **Neo4j Bulk CSV Export** (#665) by @Luffy2208
  - Added `Neo4jCSVExporter` for generating Neo4j bulk-import CSV files compatible with `neo4j-admin database import`
  - Produces deterministic `nodes.csv` and `relationships.csv` with stable node IDs — reuses existing graph IDs or derives reproducible SHA-256 content-based IDs when none are present
  - Multi-label support via Neo4j `:LABEL` convention with configurable `label_separator` (default `;`)
  - Alphabetically sorted property columns and deterministic row ordering for reproducible output across permuted inputs
  - Relationship endpoint resolution: aliases (`name`, `text`, `label`) automatically mapped to stable node IDs
  - Nested property serialisation to canonical JSON; flat scalar values written directly
  - `dry_run()` method for pre-flight CSV validation without writing files
  - `validate_export()` for post-write integrity checks (unique `:id`, consistent column widths, valid endpoint references)
  - `export_nodes()` and `export_relationships()` for partial exports
  - `strict=True` mode raises `ValidationError` on unresolved relationship endpoints
  - `export_neo4j_csv()` convenience function and `format="neo4j_csv"` / `format="neo4j-csv"` dispatch in `export_knowledge_graph()`
  - Registry integration under the `neo4j_csv` task namespace
  - Documentation added to `semantica/export/export_usage.md` with usage examples, mapping assumptions, and `neo4j-admin` import command
  - 13 tests covering headers, node/relationship CSV structure, multi-label, missing properties, deterministic output, CSV quoting/escaping, Unicode, empty graphs, dry-run, duplicate ID detection, ambiguous alias handling, nested property serialisation, and `KnowledgeGraph` integration

### Fixed

- **Neo4j CSV exporter `_write_csv` crashed with `TypeError` on dialect kwargs** (#665) by @KaifAhmad1
  - Passing `delimiter=`, `encoding=`, or any caller kwarg to `export_neo4j_csv` caused `csv.writer` to receive unknown or duplicate keyword arguments; `_write_csv` now whitelists only valid `csv.writer` dialect params (`quotechar`, `doublequote`, `skipinitialspace`, `escapechar`, `strict`)

- **`export_neo4j_csv` double-passed kwargs to both the constructor and `export()`** (#665) by @KaifAhmad1
  - Constructor-level settings (`node_file_name`, `relationship_file_name`, `encoding`, `delimiter`, `label_separator`, `strict`) were merged into config for the constructor then re-forwarded as `**kwargs` to `export_knowledge_graph`, causing dialect params to collide; kwargs are now split into `init_kwargs` and `call_kwargs` before forwarding

- **Dead `node_id_lookup` dict removed from `_prepare_export`** (#665) by @KaifAhmad1
  - The `{original_index → stable_id}` mapping was built on every export but never consumed; removed to avoid misleading future readers

- **Dropped ambiguous `format="neo4j"` alias from `export_knowledge_graph` dispatch** (#665) by @KaifAhmad1
  - `"neo4j"` is used throughout the codebase to identify the live Bolt/Cypher graph store backend; routing it silently to the offline bulk-CSV exporter would have confused callers; only `"neo4j_csv"` and `"neo4j-csv"` are accepted

- **`export_usage.md` documented non-existent constructor and function parameters** (#665) by @KaifAhmad1
  - Examples showed `node_label_sep` (correct: `label_separator`), `strict_validation` (correct: `strict`), and `nodes_path`/`rels_path` kwargs that do not exist; all three examples corrected to match the actual API

- **Public API Ingestion Support** (#602) by @Luffy2208
  - Added `PublicAPIIngestor` class built on top of `RESTIngestor` for credential-free REST endpoints
  - Added `PublicAPIExample` and `PublicAPIExamples` catalog with 6 pre-configured no-auth examples:
    - `jsonplaceholder_posts`, `jsonplaceholder_users`, `jsonplaceholder_todos` — fake REST resources for testing
    - `rest_countries_all` — country reference data
    - `data_gov_datasets` — Data.gov CKAN catalog search
    - `open_meteo_forecast` — weather forecast (Berlin sample)
  - Added `PublicAPIDetection` dataclass for endpoint-level public/no-auth detection
  - Endpoint-level public API detection via `detect_public_api()` (informational, never raises)
  - No-auth validation: rejects `Authorization`, `X-Api-Key`, and all common auth headers before sending the request
  - Auth credential detection in URL query strings (`api_key=`, `token=`, `access_token=`, etc.)
  - Polite rate limiting with per-request and per-ingestor `rate_limit_delay` controls
  - Response parsing for JSON, CSV, and XML with `response_format="auto"` content-type detection
  - HTML response guard — `text/html` responses are never misclassified as XML
  - Nested `record_path` dot-notation extraction (e.g. `"result.results"` for Data.gov envelope)
  - `_to_records` normalization with automatic envelope unwrapping for `items`, `data`, `results`, `records` keys
  - `batch_public_apis()` for multi-endpoint ingestion with optional `fail_fast`
  - `ingest_examples()` for bulk example ingestion
  - `sample_response()` fixtures on `PublicAPIExamples` for mocked unit tests without live network calls
  - `ingest_public_api()` convenience function and `ingest(..., source_type="public_api")` unified dispatch
  - `source_type="api"` alias supported in `ingest()`
  - Registry integration: `public_api` and `api` task namespaces with `endpoint`, `example`, `detect`, `batch`, `examples` methods
  - Lazy-import exports of `RESTIngestor`, `APIData`, `PublicAPIIngestor`, `PublicAPIExample`, `PublicAPIExamples`, `PublicAPIDetection` from `semantica.ingest`
  - Documentation: updated `docs/reference/ingest.md`, `docs/modules.md`, and `semantica/ingest/ingest_usage.md` with full usage examples
  - 18 mocked tests covering JSON/CSV/XML parsing, nested record extraction, auth rejection, detection, string boolean config, batch dispatch, and unified `ingest()` routing
  - 3 optional-import tests covering `defusedxml` fallback path and import isolation without web-scraping backends

### Fixed

- **Public API XML parsing hardened against malicious payloads** (#602) by @Luffy2208
  - Replaced stdlib `xml.etree.ElementTree` with `defusedxml.ElementTree` (XXE/entity-expansion safe); falls back to a hardened `lxml` parser (`resolve_entities=False`, `no_network=True`, `load_dtd=False`, `huge_tree=False`) when `defusedxml` is not installed
  - Added regression test asserting XXE entity payloads raise `ProcessingError`

- **`validate_no_auth` config value not honoured when passed as a string** (#602) by @Luffy2208
  - `bool("false")` evaluated to `True`, making `validate_no_auth=False` impossible via config files or environment variables; replaced with explicit `_coerce_bool()` that maps `"false"`, `"0"`, `"no"`, `"off"` → `False` and rejects unrecognised strings with `ValidationError`

- **Auth credential detection extended to URL query strings** (#602) by @Sameer6305
  - `detect_public_api()` and `ingest_public_api()` now scan the endpoint URL itself for auth parameters (`api_key`, `token`, `access_token`, etc.) via `urllib.parse.parse_qs`, not only request headers and explicit `params=` dicts
  - Added regression tests for URL auth rejection (3 parametrized cases)

- **`ingest_examples` and `batch_public_apis` mutable options mutation** (#602)
  - Shared `**options` dict was passed by reference across loop iterations; mutable values such as `params` dicts were silently mutated after the first call, causing subsequent calls to receive a different (partially modified) options set; fixed by deep-copying options on each iteration

- **`rate_limit_delay` forwarded twice in `ingest_public_api` method dispatcher** (#602)
  - `rate_limit_delay` was consumed by the `PublicAPIIngestor` constructor via `config` but also leaked into `request_kwargs` forwarded to the ingestor method; added to the `config_only_key` strip list so it is consumed once at construction time only

- **XML File Ingestion Support** (#560) by @Luffy2208
  - Added `XMLIngestor` class with `lxml` backend for parsing local XML files
  - Nested element hierarchy and flat element list extraction
  - Namespace and prefix extraction with collision handling
  - Attribute and element metadata extraction
  - Optional XSD schema validation with detailed error reporting
  - Optional DTD validation (internal and external)
  - Secure-by-default parser (`resolve_entities=False`, `no_network=True`) blocking XXE attacks
  - `ingest_xml()` convenience function and `ingest_file(..., method="xml")` support
  - Unified `.xml` auto-detection via `ingest("file.xml")`
  - Directory ingestion with recursive scanning and `fail_fast` support
  - `ingest_string()` for in-memory XML bytes/str ingestion
  - Comprehensive test coverage (8/8 tests passing)

### Fixed

- **NERExtractor LLM method returning pattern-based output on custom gateways** (#554, PR #556) by @KaifAhmad1

  `NERExtractor(method="llm")` silently fell back to regex/pattern extraction when used with OpenAI-compatible enterprise or self-hosted gateways (Qwen, LLaMA proxies, internal routing layers). Returned entities carried `extraction_method='pattern'` even though the LLM itself was producing correct tool-call output. Three root causes fixed:

  - **Silent exception swallowing** — `exc_info=True` was missing from the method-failure `WARNING` in `NERExtractor.extract_entities`. The full gateway-rejection traceback was invisible in logs even with `DEBUG` level enabled, making the failure impossible to diagnose without reading source code.

  - **`response_format=json_object` sent to incompatible gateways** — `OpenAIProvider.generate_structured` unconditionally included `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` in every API call. Custom/enterprise gateways frequently reject this parameter, causing both the `instructor` path and the manual repair loop to fail with the same error on every retry, eventually triggering `_extract_fallback` (pattern extraction).

  - **No fallback in the `generate_typed` manual repair loop** — when `generate_structured` itself raised (due to gateway rejection), the repair loop retried the identical failing call up to `max_retries` times before giving up. There was no path to recover via plain `generate()` + JSON parsing.

  **Additional fixes applied during PR review:**

  - Mode.JSON retry in `generate_typed` now strips `response_format` from `create_kwargs` before forwarding to the retry client, preventing incompatible kwargs from being sent to a client configured for a different instructor mode.
  - `exc_info=True` added to the `generate_structured` fallback warning in the manual repair loop for consistent observability across all failure paths.
  - Removed dead duplicate `is_available` definition in `GroqProvider` — Python silently kept only the second definition; the first was unreachable.
  - `OpenAIProvider._init_client` now validates `base_url` scheme at construction time. Non-HTTP(S) schemes (`file://`, `ftp://`, `javascript:`, etc.) raise `ValueError` immediately, preventing SSRF if `base_url` originates from configuration rather than hardcoded values.

  **17 regression tests** added in `tests/test_issue_554_fixes.py` covering all bug paths, including harshalizode's exact gateway configuration.

### Security

- **GitHub Actions workflow permissions hardened** — added explicit `permissions: contents: read` + `security-events: write` block to `defender-for-devops.yml`, resolving CodeQL alert [actions/missing-workflow-permissions](https://github.com/semantica-agi/semantica/security/code-scanning/25) (CWE: principle of least privilege).

- **DOMPurify upgraded to 3.4.0+ via npm overrides** — `monaco-editor` pinned `dompurify` at 3.2.7; added `overrides` in `explorer/package.json` to force `^3.4.0` (resolved to 3.4.10). Fixes 6 Dependabot alerts:
  - Prototype pollution → XSS bypass via `CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING` fallback (CVE-2026-41238 / GHSA-v9jr-rg53-9pgp)
  - Mutation-XSS via re-contextualization into raw-text wrappers (GHSA-h8r8-wccr-v5f2)
  - `SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES` bypass in `RETURN_DOM` mode (CVE-2026-41239 / GHSA-crv5-9vww-q3g8)
  - `ADD_TAGS` function-predicate bypasses `FORBID_TAGS` (GHSA-39q2-94rc-95cp / GHSA-h7mw-gpvr-xq4m)
  - `ADD_ATTR` predicate skips URI validation, allowing `javascript:` URLs (GHSA-cjmm-f4jc-qw8r)
  - `USE_PROFILES` prototype pollution allows event handlers (GHSA-cj63-jhhr-wcxv)

- **`uuid` upgraded to 13.0.1+ via npm overrides** — bumped from 13.0.0 to 13.0.2, fixing missing buffer bounds check in `v3`/`v5`/`v6` APIs that allowed silent partial writes into caller-provided buffers (CVE-2026-41907 / GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq).

- **Vite upgraded from 5.x to 6.4.3** — resolves path traversal in optimised-deps `.map` handling (CVE-2026-39365 / GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9) and the esbuild dev-server CORS issue (GHSA-4w7w-66w2-5vf9). Bundled esbuild updated from 0.21.5 → 0.25.12.

- **esbuild forced to 0.28.1+ via npm override** — vite 6.4.3 bundles esbuild 0.25.12 which is vulnerable to missing binary integrity verification in the Deno distribution module (GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr); added `"esbuild": "^0.28.1"` to `overrides` in `explorer/package.json`. `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities (Dependabot #15).

- **Leaked Groq API keys removed from cookbook notebooks** — 6 hardcoded `GROQ_API_KEY` values (`gsk_...`) stripped from configuration cells in `supply_chain/01`, `intelligence/01`, `cybersecurity/01`, `cybersecurity/02`, `finance/01`, and `blockchain/02`; fallback replaced with empty string (secret scanning alerts #1–#6). Keys were already publicly exposed — rotate them in the Groq console.

- **Leaked Groq API keys removed from additional cookbook notebooks** — 6 distinct hardcoded `GROQ_API_KEY` values stripped from 4 additional notebooks: `advanced_rag/01_GraphRAG_Complete`, `advanced_rag/02_RAG_vs_GraphRAG_Comparison`, `blockchain/01_DeFi_Protocol_Intelligence`, and `biomedical/01_Drug_Discovery_Pipeline` (secret scanning alerts #1–#6). Affected keys: `gsk_SLLE0...`, `gsk_S4dBVJ...`, `gsk_SLOv6...`, `gsk_lR6Qcj...`, `gsk_ToJis6...`, `gsk_LmbQBr...`; all publicly exposed since Dec 2025 — revoke in the Groq console and close the GitHub secret scanning alerts as "Revoked" in the Security tab.

- **Node distance semantics in path responses** (closes #472) — `PathResponse` gains `hop_count` and `distance_band` ("direct"/"near"/"mid-range"/"distant"); `classify_path_distance()` in `semantica/utils/helpers.py`; `KGVisualizer.visualize_network(highlight_path)` with band-scaled edge rendering.
- **Native `KnowledgeGraph` type support in `KGVisualizer`** (closes #471) — formal `KnowledgeGraph` dataclass (`entities`, `relationships`, `metadata`); `_normalize_graph()` duck-types input; raises clear `ProcessingError` on unknown types. 21 tests added.
- **Indexed search for large graphs** (PR #481, @ZohaibHassan16) — purpose-built inverted index with exact/token/prefix lookup tiers; LRU cache (128 slots); O(log n) mutation sync via `bisect.insort`; warm-query time 24 ms → 0.004 ms on 118 k-node graph.
- **Provenance traversal multi-hop fix** (PR #480, @Sameer6305) — undirected ego-graph expansion so upstream ancestors at depth ≥ 2 are no longer silently excluded; `ProvenanceEdge.direction` field (upstream/downstream/lateral); grouped markdown report under `## Upstream/Downstream/Lateral` sections.
- **TripletStore ontology namespace** (PR #447, @KaifAhmad1) — `_resolve_iri()` applies `base_uri` before `urn:` fallback; W3C prefix expansion table (owl/xsd/rdf/rdfs/skos) expands to canonical IRIs regardless of `base_uri`.
- **Blazegraph literal serialization** (PR #448, @KaifAhmad1) — `_format_object_for_sparql()` selects IRI/typed-literal/language-tagged-literal/plain-literal token; `_resolve_datatype_iri()` with prefix expansion; RFC 5646 language-tag validation; `_escape_literal()` for string escaping.
- **DeepSeek provider via OpenAI SDK** (PR #482, @liling) — `_init_client` rewritten using `openai.OpenAI(base_url=self.base_url)` instead of defunct `deepseek` package; `verbose_mode` assignment fix; `pyproject.toml` updated to `openai>=1.0.0`.

- **`DuplicateDetector` result limiting and ranking** (issue #534, by @KaifAhmad1):
  - `max_results` — hard global cap on returned candidates; applied after sorting. `None` means no limit.
  - `top_k_per_entity` — keep at most *k* candidates per entity (by the sort field) so no single entity floods the output. `None` means no per-entity limit.
  - `min_similarity` — extra similarity floor on top of `similarity_threshold`; candidates below it are dropped before ranking. `None` means no extra floor.
  - `sort_by` — ranking field before limits are applied; accepts `"confidence"` (default) or `"similarity_score"`. Invalid values raise `ValueError` at construction time.
  - All four options are applied by the new `_apply_result_limits` helper and are respected by both `detect_duplicates()` and `incremental_detect()`.
  - 15 new tests in `TestResultLimiting` covering each option in isolation and in combination.
  - **Follow-up Qodo review fixes** (by @KaifAhmad1):
    - `top_k_per_entity` now uses OR semantics — a candidate is kept if *either* entity is still under quota, preventing high-quality pairs from being silently dropped when a popular counterpart saturates its limit.
    - `max_results` and `top_k_per_entity` now validated at construction time; negative or non-integer values raise `ValueError`.
    - `min_similarity` now validated in `[0.0, 1.0]` at construction; out-of-range values raise `ValueError`.
    - Added `_normalize_entity_id` helper (always returns `str`) used consistently in both `_apply_result_limits` and `_build_duplicate_groups`, eliminating `int` vs `str` ID key mismatches.
    - Updated `detect_duplicates` and `incremental_detect` docstrings to reflect the configurable `sort_by` field.

### Fixed

- **Fix: `ConflictDetector.detect_conflicts()` raises `AttributeError` when called with `method=` or `property_name=` kwargs** (issue #533, PR conflicts, by @KaifAhmad1):
  - `detect_conflicts` was defined twice in `conflict_detector.py`; Python silently overwrote the first (dispatcher) definition with the second (comprehensive), which accepted no `method` or `property_name` parameters — causing `AttributeError` or `TypeError` for any caller using those kwargs.
  - Removed the first (dead) definition and merged its dispatcher logic into the surviving method. New signature: `detect_conflicts(entities, method="all", property_name=None, entity_type=None, **kwargs)`.
  - Supported `method` values: `"all"` (default, comprehensive), `"value"`, `"property"`, `"type"`, `"relationship"`, `"temporal"`, `"logical"`, `"entity"`. Unknown values raise `ValueError`.
  - Fixed `method="relationship"` silently defaulting `relationships` to the entities list, which caused entity dicts to be iterated as relationship dicts producing silent wrong results (`None_None_None` keys). Now defaults to `[]` with dict normalization.
  - Removed unreachable dead code (`for field_name in fields_to_check` loop after `try/except raise`) in `detect_entity_conflicts`.
  - **Follow-up Qodo review fix** — hardened `method="relationship"` normalization: when `relationships` kwarg is a dict whose `"relationships"` value is itself a non-list (or the key is absent), the value is now always wrapped in a list before being passed to `detect_relationship_conflicts`, guaranteeing `List[Dict]` input in all cases.

- **Fix: `semantica[all]` installation fails on Windows due to `faiss-gpu` dependency** (issue #532, PR #utlis, by @KaifAhmad1):
  - `[all]` bundled the `[gpu]` extra (`faiss-gpu>=1.7.0`, `cupy>=10.0.0`), which has no Windows builds, causing `pip install "semantica[all]"` to fail with `No matching distribution found for faiss-gpu>=1.7.0`.
  - Removed `gpu` from both `[all]` lines in `pyproject.toml` — `[all]` now installs only cross-platform dependencies. Users on Linux who need GPU acceleration can install `semantica[gpu]` explicitly.

- **Fix: Progress tracker crashes with `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows cp1252 consoles** (issue #531, PR #utlis, by @KaifAhmad1):
  - `ConsoleProgressDisplay.update()` had 5 direct `sys.stdout.write()` calls that bypassed the existing `_safe_write()` guard, causing `UnicodeEncodeError` when emoji characters (`🧠`, `📊`) were written to cp1252-encoded consoles during any progress-tracked operation.
  - All 5 calls replaced with `self._safe_write()`, which catches `UnicodeEncodeError` and re-encodes output with `errors="replace"` so progress output never crashes the process.
  - Added `TestProgressTrackerEncoding` regression class (3 tests) covering `_safe_write` safety, pipeline header write, and auto emoji-disable on cp1252 stdout.

- **Fix: Break circular import in `semantic_extract`; address Qodo review bug** (issue #528, PR #536, by @ZohaibHassan16, review fixes by @KaifAhmad1):
  - **Root cause** — `ner_extractor.py` imported `get_entity_method` from `methods.py`, while `methods.py` imported `Entity` from `ner_extractor.py`, creating a circular import that raised `ImportError: cannot import name 'Entity' from partially initialized module` on any import of `semantica.semantic_extract`.
  - `semantica/semantic_extract/types.py` (new) — shared `Entity`, `Relation`, and `Triplet` dataclasses extracted into a dedicated module that neither side of the old cycle imports, so both `ner_extractor`, `relation_extractor`, `triplet_extractor`, and `methods` can import from it freely.
  - `semantica/semantic_extract/__init__.py` — lazy-loads package-level exports so core extractor imports do not pull in optional modules (e.g. the YAML-backed semantic network extractor); added `TripleExtractor` as a compatibility alias for `TripletExtractor`; legacy re-exports from the individual extractor modules preserved for backward compatibility.
  - `semantica/semantic_extract/methods.py` — updated to import shared types from `types.py`; extractor-specific imports moved to function scope where needed to prevent re-introducing the cycle.
  - Added regression tests (`tests/semantic_extract/test_imports.py`) covering import order independence (methods-before-extractors and extractors-before-methods), legacy type import compatibility, `TripleExtractor` alias, and that core imports do not require `yaml`.
  - **Review fix (Qodo — Py3.8 test import crash)**: `test_imports.py` annotated `_run_python` as `-> subprocess.CompletedProcess[str]`, which is not subscriptable at runtime on Python 3.8 (generic subscript on built-in types requires 3.9+). Added `from __future__ import annotations` (PEP 563) so all annotations are lazy strings never evaluated at import time, restoring compatibility with the declared `requires-python = ">=3.8"` without any behaviour change on 3.9+.
- **Fix: Lazy-load optional ingest backends; address Qodo review bugs** (issue #527, PR #535, by @ZohaibHassan16, review fixes by @KaifAhmad1):
  - `semantica/ingest/__init__.py` — core exports (`FileIngestor`, `ingest_file`, config, registry) remain eagerly imported; all optional backends (`WebIngestor`, `FeedIngestor`, `RepoIngestor`, `EmailIngestor`, `StreamIngestor`, `DBIngestor`, `MCPIngestor`, `OntologyIngestor`, `SnowflakeIngestor`) are now deferred behind a module-level `__getattr__`, so `from semantica.ingest import FileIngestor` no longer fails when GitPython or BeautifulSoup4 are absent.
  - `semantica/ingest/methods.py` — backend imports relocated into their respective ingestion functions (`ingest_web`, `ingest_feed`, `ingest_repository`, `ingest_email`) with helper `_missing_optional_dependency()` / `_is_missing_dependency()` for consistent, actionable error messages.
  - **Review fix (Bug 1 — overbroad missing-dep detection)**: replaced `except ImportError` with `except ModuleNotFoundError` in all four function-level import guards and in `__getattr__`. `ImportError` catches failures thrown by code *inside* a successfully found module, masking real bugs with a misleading "package not installed" message; `ModuleNotFoundError` (its subclass) is specific to absent modules. Simplified `_is_missing_dependency` to rely solely on `exc.name` now that `ModuleNotFoundError` always sets it.
  - **Review fix (Bug 2 — expected errors logged as failures)**: added `except ConfigurationError: raise` before the blanket `except Exception` handlers in `ingest_web`, `ingest_feed`, `ingest_repository`, and `ingest_email`. Missing optional dependencies are expected user-configuration issues and must not produce error-level log entries.
  - **Review fix (Bug 3 — test blocker not setting `exc.name`)**: `OptionalDependencyBlocker.find_spec` now sets `err.name = root_name` on the manually constructed `ModuleNotFoundError`, matching what Python's import machinery does, so `_is_missing_dependency` correctly identifies the missing package in tests.
  - Added regression tests (`tests/ingest/test_optional_imports.py`) that block the `git` and `bs4` modules via a custom meta path finder and assert core imports succeed and backends raise `ConfigurationError` with an actionable message.
- **Fix: Ontology Hub post-review bug fixes and security hardening** (follow-up to #518, closes security advisory #23, by @KaifAhmad1):
  - **Broken registry filters** — `fetchRegistry` was sending toolbar filter values (`owl`, `skos`, `internal`, `external`) to the backend as the `status` query param, which only accepts `published|draft|external`, causing those filters to return empty lists. Removed the spurious `status` param; all format/kind filtering is now applied client-side via `filteredEntries`, which already had the correct logic.
  - **Toggle/refresh URI corruption** — `toggle_ontology` and `refresh_ontology` applied `.removesuffix("/toggle")` / `.removesuffix("/refresh")` to the captured path parameter, which would silently corrupt any ontology URI that legitimately ends with those strings. Starlette's route regex (`/{uri:path}/toggle`) already strips the literal suffix via backtracking, so the `removesuffix` calls were removed and the raw `ontology_uri` parameter is used directly.
  - **SSRF in URL fetch** — `_fetch_url_sync()` accepted arbitrary user-supplied URLs and called `requests.get()` with no validation, enabling server-side request forgery against internal services. Added `_validate_fetch_url()` which rejects non-`http`/`https` schemes and resolves the hostname via `socket.getaddrinfo`, blocking loopback, private, link-local, reserved, and multicast addresses.
  - **File upload format misdetected** — the file picker accepted `.xml` and `.json` but `fmtMap` had no entries for those extensions, causing them to default to `turtle`. Added `xml: "xml"` and `json: "json-ld"` mappings. Changed the unknown-extension fallback from `|| "turtle"` to `?? ""` (empty string), and omit the `format` key from the request body when empty so the backend `_detect_format()` runs instead of receiving a forced incorrect value. Also added `.n3` to the accepted extension list and dropzone hint.
  - **Inconsistent XML hardening** — `_parse_rdf_sync()` called `rdflib.Graph().parse()` directly, bypassing the `defusedxml`-based XXE protection already present in `semantica/explorer/utils/rdf_parser.py`. Now routes through `_safe_parse_rdf()` from that module, applying consistent protection for all RDF/XML parse paths.
  - **Search scans whole graph** (`GET /api/ontology/search`) — the endpoint fetched up to 999 999 nodes and performed a linear Python substring scan on every request. Replaced with `session.search(q, limit * 6)` which uses the `GraphSearchIndex`; results are then post-filtered by `_SEARCHABLE_TYPES` and `entity_type` before being returned up to the requested limit.
  - **ReDoS in format detector** (security advisory #23, CodeQL `py/polynomial-redos`, CWE-1333/730/400) — `_detect_format()` used `re.match(r"_:\w+|<[^>]+>\s+<[^>]+>", ...)` to detect N-Triples content. The `<[^>]+>\s+<[^>]+>` alternative was flagged as a polynomial regular expression on uncontrolled data. The URI-subject branch was already unreachable (strings starting with `<` return `"xml"` two lines above), so the entire regex was replaced with two O(1) string operations: `stripped.startswith("_:")` and `" <" in stripped`. `import re` removed as now unused.
- **OWLExporter Turtle syntax** (closes #478) — invalid multi-block output fixed via `_ttl_block()`; data properties no longer silently dropped; `_escape_ttl_str()` applied to all label/comment/version sites. 43 tests added.
- **OWLGenerator schema compatibility** (Issue #446) — label-first IRI fallback, list-typed datatype ranges, per-call namespace consistency, `subClassOf`/`subclassOf` parity.
- **TripletStore IRI regressions** (PR #447 follow-up) — non-string IDs coerced to `str()`; W3C prefix expansion now correct regardless of `base_uri`.
- **`KGVisualizer` accepts `KnowledgeGraph` objects** (closes #458) — `_normalize_graph()` duck-types input; raises clear `ProcessingError` on unknown types. 21 tests added.
- **Semantic Distance UI slash-safe routes** (PR #515, @ZohaibHassan16) — query-param routes `/api/graph/semantic-neighborhood?node_id=` and `/api/graph/path?source=&target=` bypass FastAPI's `%2F` pre-decode; legacy path-segment routes kept as deprecated aliases.
- **Explorer Distance Intelligence rendering** (PR #513, @ZohaibHassan16) — distance state flows through Sigma reducer/theme pipeline instead of mutating raw graph attributes; `restoreNodeColors()` race eliminated by merging ego/heatmap `useEffect` hooks.
- **Distance Intelligence code review regressions** (PR #502 follow-up, @KaifAhmad1) — `top_k` param name fix; `include_distance_metadata` gated behind `False` default; `weakest_link` key standardized; temporal sampling uses `timedelta` not `timetuple`; O(E×L) decay replaced with O(E) index; `AgentContext._apply_proximity_metadata` stores `graph_node_id` separately; sweep animation `sweepGeneration` counter fix; HTTP 413 for >200 node subsets; upper-triangle distance matrix.
- **Knowledge Explorer blockers** (PR #420, @ZohaibHassan16):
  - `Dockerfile`: renamed `DockerFile` → `Dockerfile`; fixed `CMD` module path; added `app = create_app()` at module level.
  - CORS: default origins narrowed from `"*"` to `localhost:5173` only.
  - `get_ws_manager()` now raises HTTP 503 instead of unhandled `AttributeError`.
  - SPARQL: read-only enforcement — `INSERT`/`DELETE`/`UPDATE`/`LOAD`/`DROP` rejected.
  - Vocabulary: 10 MB upload cap; JSON-LD format auto-detection for `.jsonld`/`.json-ld`/`.json`.
  - Annotation `O(1)` lookup via `GraphSession.get_annotation(id)`.
  - Self-loop guard in `batchMergeEdges` prevents Graphology crash.
  - Static build artifacts removed from git; `semantica/static/` added to `.gitignore`.
- **Ontology Hub post-review hardening** (PR #518 follow-up, @KaifAhmad1):
  - Registry filter: `status` param removed from `fetchRegistry`; filtering applied client-side.
  - Toggle/refresh URI: removed `.removesuffix()` calls that corrupted URIs ending with those strings.
  - Format detector: `_detect_format()` ReDoS eliminated — `re.match` replaced with two O(1) string ops.
  - Broken `fmtMap` entries: added `xml`/`json` mappings; unknown-extension fallback changed from `|| "turtle"` to `?? ""`.
  - XML hardening: `_parse_rdf_sync()` now routes through `_safe_parse_rdf()` for consistent defusedxml XXE protection.
  - Search: replaced O(999 999) linear scan with `GraphSearchIndex`-backed `session.search()`.

### Security

  - **[HIGH — CWE-346/200]** Missing security headers in `server.py`: `CORSMiddleware`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, HSTS, generic 500 handler.
  - **[HIGH — CWE-346/400]** Overpermissive CORS in `explorer/app.py`: methods/headers narrowed; 64 KB WebSocket frame cap.
  - **[MEDIUM — CWE-20]** Algorithm param unconstrained in `graph.py`: enum-validated `bfs|dijkstra` only.
  - **[MEDIUM — CWE-434]** RDF upload without extension check in `vocabulary.py`: `.ttl/.rdf/.owl/.xml/.jsonld` allowlist enforced.
  - **[MEDIUM — CWE-1336]** Prompt injection in `llm_extraction.py`: user-supplied content wrapped in `json.dumps()`.
  - **[MEDIUM — CWE-95]** Dynamic `__import__()` in `pipeline_validator.py`: replaced with proper module-level import.
  - **[MEDIUM — CWE-1333]** ReDoS in `enrich.py`: whitespace-normalize then split on literal `" AND "`.
  - **[LOW — CWE-22]** Path traversal in `server.py` SPA route: `Path.resolve().relative_to()` guard; 400 on escape.
  - **[LOW — CWE-400]** Unbounded SPARQL in `sparql.py`: 5 000-row cap, 30 s `asyncio.wait_for` timeout, `Semaphore(4)` concurrency cap; `SparqlResponse.truncated` field added.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

**Temporal Intelligence** (@KaifAhmad1, PRs #396–#402)

- **Core Temporal Data Model** (PR #396) — `semantica.kg.temporal_model` with shared parsing/normalization/serialization helpers; `TemporalBound` and `BiTemporalFact` exported from `semantica.kg`; valid-time and transaction-time filtering; `TemporalValidationError` on invalid inputs; history-preserving revisions in `TemporalVersionManager.apply_revision()` with supersession semantics.
- **Point-in-Time Query Engine** (PR #397) — `TemporalGraphQuery.reconstruct_at_time(graph, at_time)` builds consistent point-in-time subgraphs without mutating source; `TemporalConsistencyReport` detects inverted intervals, relationships outside entity lifetimes, overlapping same-type relationships, and temporal gaps; sequence/cycle pattern detection; calendar-aligned evolution bucketing via `temporal_granularity`; causal ordering controls on `find_temporal_paths()` (strict/overlap/loose).
- **Deterministic Temporal Reasoning Engine** (PR #398) — `semantica.kg.temporal_reasoning`; full Allen interval algebra via `IntervalRelation` (all 13 relations); `TemporalReasoningEngine` with interval merging, gap analysis, coverage calculation, timelines, retroactive coverage; zero LLM calls; circular import risk between `semantica.reasoning` and `semantica.kg` eliminated.
- **Temporal Awareness in ContextGraph** (PR #399) — `Decision` dataclass gains `valid_from`/`valid_until`; superseded decisions remain in graph (immutable history); `find_precedents_by_scenario(include_superseded, as_of)`; `ContextGraph.state_at(timestamp)` serializable snapshot; `CausalChainAnalyzer.trace_at_time(event_id, at_time)`; `AgentContext.checkpoint(label)`, `diff_checkpoints()`, `flush_checkpoint()`.
- **Temporal Metadata Extraction from Text** (PR #400):
  - `extract_relations_llm(extract_temporal_bounds=True)` — each `Relation` gains `valid_from`, `valid_until`, `temporal_confidence` (0.0–1.0), `temporal_source_text`; default `False` is 100% backward-compatible.
  - Calibrated confidence anchors: 1.00 = full ISO date → 0.00 = no temporal signal.
  - `TemporalNormalizer` (zero LLM calls, pure regex + dateutil): `normalize(value)` → UTC datetime tuple or `None`; `normalize_phrase(phrase)` → metadata dict or `None`; 13-domain default phrase map; `TemporalAmbiguityWarning` for ambiguous DD/MM/YYYY inputs (never silently guesses locale).
- **Temporal Provenance & OWL-Time Export** (PR #401):
  - `ProvenanceTracker.track_entity()` auto-stamps `recorded_at` on every new record.
  - `query_recorded_between(start, end)`, `revision_history(fact_id)`, `export_audit_log(fact_ids, format)` (JSON/CSV).
  - `RDFExporter.export_to_rdf(include_temporal=True, time_axis="valid|transaction|both")` — emits OWL-Time triples for all temporally-annotated relationships.
  - `create_snapshot()` stamps `"format_version": "1.0"`; `validate_snapshot()` and `migrate_snapshot()` for stable snapshot lifecycle.
- **Temporal GraphRAG Integration** (PR #402) — `TemporalGraphRetriever` filters retrieved context to a point in time; `ContextRetriever.query_with_reasoning(at_time, header_template)` prepends structured temporal header; `TemporalQueryRewriter` extracts temporal intent (before/after/at/during/between) from natural language; regex-only by default, optional LLM-assisted mode.

**Ontology** (@KaifAhmad1 @ZohaibHassan16)

- **SHACL Shape Generation & Validation** (PR #318) — `SHACLGenerator` derives SHACL node/property shapes from any ontology dict; three quality tiers (basic/standard/strict); Turtle/JSON-LD/N-Triples output; iterative multi-level inheritance propagation, cycle-safe; `OntologyEngine.to_shacl()`, `export_shacl()`, `validate_graph(explain=True)`; `SHACLValidationReport` with plain-English explanations for all 7 constraint types. `pip install semantica[shacl]`.
- **SKOS Vocabulary Module** (PR #319) — `TripletStore.add_skos_concept()` / `get_skos_concepts(scheme_uri)`; `OntologyEngine.list_vocabularies()`, `list_concepts()`, `search_concepts()`; `NamespaceManager.get_skos_uri()` / `build_concept_scheme_uri()`; SPARQL injection hardened.
- **Ontology Alignment API** (PR #361) — `OntologyEngine.create_alignment()`, `get_alignments()`, `list_alignments()`; OWL/SKOS standard predicates (`owl:equivalentClass`, all five `skos:*Match`); `ReuseManager.suggest_alignments()`; `QueryEngine.expand_entity_uri(use_alignments=True)` with SPARQL `VALUES` clause injection; SPARQL injection hardened.
- **Ontology Diff & Migration** (PR #367) — `VersionManager.diff_ontologies()` covering classes/properties/individuals/axioms; `ChangeLogAnalyzer.analyze()` classifying CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/INFO impact; `ImpactReport`, `generate_change_report()`; `OntologyEngine.compare_versions()` end-to-end orchestrator with optional validation and graph-instance checks.

**Knowledge Explorer API** (@ZohaibHassan16 @KaifAhmad1)

- **Full FastAPI backend** (PR #384) — `semantica.explorer` package with graph, analytics, decisions, temporal, enrichment, export/import, annotations routes; 12 export formats; WebSocket progress for import; 99 integration tests. `pip install semantica[explorer]`; CLI: `semantica-explorer --graph my_graph.json`.
- **Thread safety** (PR #385) — `ContextGraph` and `GraphSession` protected with `threading.RLock`; 8 analytics components lazily initialized under lock.
- **In-memory fallbacks** (PR #386) — All 7 `DecisionQuery` and 4 `DecisionRecorder` methods have `ContextGraph` fallback paths for in-memory usage without a graph DB.
- **Snapshot schema compatibility** (PR #393) — accepts both `nodes`/`edges` and `entities`/`relationships` snapshot schemas transparently; metadata counts always accurate.
- **Audit trail & rollback protection** (PR #394) — mutation-level audit tracking, named version tags, `restore_snapshot()` requires explicit confirmation, `get_node_history()`, `diff()` Git-like alias.
- **SKOS Vocabulary REST API** (PR #426) — `GET /api/vocabulary/schemes`, `GET /api/vocabulary/hierarchy?scheme=<uri>` with cycle detection, `POST /api/vocabulary/import` (.ttl/.rdf/.owl; HTTP 422 on invalid).
- **O(N) → O(limit) Pagination** (PR #431) — `find_nodes`/`find_edges` use `itertools.islice` on generators; ghost-node fix (accepts `source_id`/`target_id` and `source`/`target` key names); deterministic page boundaries via `sorted()`; `stats()` applies same validity filters as pagination.
- **Named graph support** (PR #432, @Sameer6305) — `enable_named_graphs` flag forwarded correctly through `TripletStore.execute_query()`; duplicate `FROM`/`FROM NAMED` clauses prevented; graph URIs percent-encoded in DROP statements.

**Integrations**

- **Agno Agentic Framework** (Issue #249, @KaifAhmad1) — 5 components, all degrading gracefully when `agno` is not installed:
  - `AgnoContextStore` — graph-backed agent memory implementing `agno.memory.db.base.MemoryDb`.
  - `AgnoKnowledgeGraph` — multi-hop GraphRAG knowledge base implementing `agno.knowledge.base.AgentKnowledge`.
  - `AgnoDecisionKit` — 6 decision-intelligence tools (record_decision, find_precedents, trace_causal_chain, analyze_impact, check_policy, get_decision_summary).
  - `AgnoKGToolkit` — 7 KG pipeline tools (extract_entities, extract_relations, add_to_graph, query_graph, find_related, infer_facts, export_subgraph).
  - `AgnoSharedContext` — team coordinator with single shared `ContextGraph`; `bind_agent(role)` returns role-scoped view; thread-safe via `RLock`.
  - 110 integration tests; 3 cookbook notebooks. `pip install semantica[agno]`.
- **Novita AI Provider** (PR #374, @Alex-wuhu) — OpenAI-compatible; default model `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2`; `NOVITA_API_KEY`; `create_provider("novita")`.

**Reasoning**

- **Native Datalog Reasoning Engine** (PR #371, @ZohaibHassan16) — pure-Python bottom-up semi-naive fixpoint with guaranteed termination; recursive Horn clause rules (e.g. `ancestor(X,Y) :- parent(X,Z), ancestor(Z,Y).`); O(1) delta-index lookup; `load_from_graph(ContextGraph)`; `query("pred(?X, ?Y)")` with optional `bindings=`; `DatalogReasoner`, `DatalogFact`, `DatalogRule` exported from `semantica.reasoning`.

### Fixed

- **Pattern Matcher restored** (PR #387, @ZohaibHassan16) — dead code silently overwrote `_match_pattern` regex (pre-bound variable embedding, repeated-variable backreferences) with `re.escape`, breaking transitivity/symmetry/self-join rules; removed. `re.error` now surfaced instead of swallowed.
- **OllamaProvider base_url ignored** (PR #408, @AlexeyMyslin) — `ollama.Client(host=self.base_url)` instead of raw module assignment; remote Ollama servers now reachable.
- **spaCy runtime fallback** — `NERExtractor` now catches runtime initialization failures, not just missing-model errors.
- **CentralityCalculator crash** — `_build_adjacency()` handles both ContextGraph dataclass edges (`source_id`/`target_id`) and plain dicts.
- **`find_path` always used BFS** (PR #384) — algorithm query param now correctly dispatched to `dijkstra_shortest_path` or `bfs_shortest_path`.
- **Event loop blocked in `/api/enrich/links`** (PR #385) — `score_link` scoring loop wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`.
- **Temp file leak in `export_graph`** (PR #384) — `try/finally` cleanup for all error paths.
- **`ChangeCategory` enum typo** (PR #367) — `"potenitally_breaking"` → `"potentially_breaking"`.
- **DecisionQuery/DecisionRecorder fallbacks** (PR #386) — `type()` guard instead of `isinstance()` for Mock safety; flat property storage in `_store_decision_node`; spurious `properties={}` kwarg removed; tz-aware/naive datetime mismatch resolved; `find_edges()` hoisted out of BFS loop (O(nodes×edges) → O(1) per call).
- **Snapshot schema** (PR #393) — silent restore failures when `nodes`/`edges` schema didn't match legacy `entities`/`relationships` expectations.
- **Context explainability** (@KaifAhmad1) — decision nodes now store full `scenario`/`reasoning` text; causal/precedent reconstruction returns enriched `Decision` objects; `PolicyEngine.get_affected_decisions()` consistent across Cypher and fallback branches.

### Security

- **CWE-312/359/532** — Removed `api_key` debug `print` blocks from `relation_extractor.py` and `triplet_extractor.py`.
- **CWE-20** — URL sanitization: `"url" in urls` replaced with `any(url == "url" for url in urls)`, eliminating substring match.
- **CI overpermissions** — `permissions: contents: read` added to `benchmark.yml` and `security.yml`.
- **SHACL path traversal** (PR #318) — replaced `len < 500 and "\n" not in s` heuristic with `os.path.exists()`.
- **SHACL inheritance mutation** (PR #318) — `_propagate_inheritance` uses `dataclasses.replace()` instead of appending parent `PropertyShape` objects by reference.
- **SPARQL injection** (PR #361) — `search_concepts`, `list_alignments`, `build_values_clause` fully hardened.

---

### Performance

- ~1.89× speedup via parallel extraction (Groq `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, standard datasets).
- Optimized entity matching: exact/substring/word-boundary fast paths before embedding similarity.

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed

- **LLM Output Stability** (Bug #176) — correct `max_tokens` propagation; automatic chunk-halving and retry on context/output limit errors.
- Removed hardcoded `max_length` constraints from `Entity`, `Relation`, `Triplet`.
- Orchestrator lazy property initialization and configuration normalization.
- `AssertionError` in orchestrator tests (mock alignment).
- Pinned `protobuf>=5.29.1,<7.0`, `grpcio>=1.71.2`; added `GitPython` and `chardet` to `pyproject.toml`.

### Changed

- Increased default `max_text_length` to 64 000 characters for all major providers.
- Standardized Groq defaults: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, 64 k context, native `max_tokens`/`max_completion_tokens`.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- **Amazon Neptune Support** — `AmazonNeptuneStore` via Bolt/OpenCypher; `NeptuneAuthTokenManager` with AWS IAM SigV4 signing; retry/backoff. `pip install semantica[graph-amazon-neptune]`.
- **Docling Integration** — `DoclingParser` for PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/HTML/image parsing; OCR support; Markdown/HTML/JSON export.
- **Robust Extraction Fallbacks** — ML/LLM → Pattern → Last Resort chains across all extractors.
- **Provenance & Tracking** — `batch_index` and `document_id` metadata on all extracted items.
- **Semantic Extract** — auto-chunking for long text; `silent_fail` parameter; JSON parsing with 3-attempt exponential backoff.
- End-to-end KG pipeline integration tests; `TextEmbedder` model switching tests.

### Changed

- Removed internal dedup logic from extractors (deferred to `semantica/conflicts`).
- Standardized batch processing across all extractors using unified `extract`/`analyze`/`resolve` pattern.
- Clarified weighted confidence scoring (50% Method Confidence + 50% Type Similarity).

### Fixed

- `NameError` in `extraction_validator.py` (missing `Union` import).
- Extractors returning empty lists for valid input when primary methods fail.
- Model switching bug in `TextEmbedder` (state not cleared on model switch). (Issue #160)
- `TypeError: unhashable type: 'Entity'` in `GraphAnalyzer`. (Issue #159)
- Pinned `protobuf==4.25.3`, `grpcio==1.67.1`.
- `TripletExtractor.validate_triplets` shadowed by internal attribute.
- Incorrect `TextSplitter` import path.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- Exported `DoclingParser` and `DoclingMetadata` from `semantica.parse`.
- Windows-specific troubleshooting note for PyTorch DLL issues.

### Fixed

- `DoclingParser` import/export across platforms (Windows, Linux, Google Colab).
- Error messaging when optional `docling` dependency is missing.
- Versioning inconsistencies across the framework.

---
