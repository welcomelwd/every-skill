# That schema sets additionalProperties:false and marks `active`, `tags`, `meta`,
# `isArchived`, `triggerCount` and the id/timestamp fields readOnly, so sending any
# of them rejects the entire request with 400. `active` and `tags` are changed
# through their own endpoints (activate/deactivate, PUT /workflows/{id}/tags).
# Checked against the schema on n8n 2.16.1 and 2.33.3; `nodeGroups` and
# `parentFolderId` only exist on the latter, and are listed so an edit made against
# a newer instance does not silently drop node groups or move a workflow to the root.

# it clears the stored value, whereas omitting the key leaves it alone — so their
# nulls have to be forwarded. `versions rollback` depends on this: a snapshot taken
# before any pinned data was added carries `pinData: null`, and dropping it would
# leave today's pinned data in place while reporting a successful rollback.
# `parentFolderId` documents null as "move it to the project root".
# The rest are non-nullable (`description` is a plain string), and echoing back the
# null that a GET returned is rejected outright.

# without them — losing a canvas grouping beats losing the whole import.
