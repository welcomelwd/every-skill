# 3MF CLI — Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview

The **3MF CLI** (`cli-anything-3mf`) is an agent-native command-line interface for
inspecting, modifying, and repairing 3MF mesh files used in 3D printing.

Unlike traditional 3D-printing CLI tools (PrusaSlicer CLI, BambuStudio CLI, admesh)
that treat meshes as opaque triangle soups, this tool provides **feature-aware
geometry editing** — it can detect cylindrical holes, measure their diameters, and
resize them via CLI commands.

## 3MF Format

A 3MF file is a ZIP archive containing:
- `[Content_Types].xml` — MIME type declarations
- `_rels/.rels` — relationship definitions
- `3D/3dmodel.model` — XML mesh data (core spec namespace: `http://schemas.microsoft.com/3dmanufacturing/core/2015/02`)
- `Metadata/` — slicer settings, thumbnails, plate configurations (BambuStudio, PrusaSlicer)

## Core Algorithm

### Hole Detection (inspector.py)
1. Take N cross-sections perpendicular to the hole axis
2. At each section, identify circular entities via trimesh path analysis
3. Fit circles using least-squares (Kasa method)
4. Group circles across sections by center proximity
5. Calculate confidence from detection consistency

### Hole Resize (modifier.py)
1. Re-detect holes to get current geometry
2. Find wall vertices at known radii from hole axis
3. Scale vertices radially: `new_pos = center + direction * (new_r / old_r)`
4. Fix degenerate faces caused by coincident vertices

### Mesh Repair (repair.py)
1. Merge duplicate vertices (coordinate rounding + dedup)
2. Remove degenerate triangles (collapsed faces)
3. Remove unreferenced vertices
4. Fix face winding via trimesh

## Slicer Compatibility

The tool preserves all non-mesh content during repack:
- BambuStudio: project_settings.config, model_settings.config, plate thumbnails
- PrusaSlicer: slic3r_pe configs, layer height profiles

Mesh triangle attributes are also preserved when the corresponding triangle is
kept. This includes material/property attributes such as `pid`, `p1`, `p2`, and
`p3`, plus unknown vendor attributes on `<triangle>` elements.

Component-only objects and build/component `transform` attributes are preserved
as untouched XML when writing files loaded from an existing 3MF archive. The
current geometry operations do not resolve component transforms into mesh
coordinates and cannot edit component-instance transforms directly.

Output files can be reopened in the original slicer without configuration loss.
