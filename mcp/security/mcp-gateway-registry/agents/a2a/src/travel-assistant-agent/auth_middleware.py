"""Reusable JWT-authentication middleware for A2A agent servers.

The A2A mount and the custom ``/api/*`` endpoints drive an LLM tool loop that can
call registry operations, book flights, and move money. Left unauthenticated, any
network-reachable caller could trigger those actions. This middleware enforces a
bearer-JWT check in front of every request so only callers holding a token minted
by the trusted Keycloak realm reach the agent.

Design notes (fail closed):
    - Deny by default. A request without a valid token is rejected with 401; a
      request whose token fails signature/issuer/expiry/audience validation is
      rejected. Only an explicit allowlist of unauthenticated paths (health
      probes) is exempt.
    - If authentication is not configured (no issuer/JWKS reachable), the
      middleware still denies protected paths rather than falling open. Set
      ``AGENT_AUTH_DISABLED=true`` to intentionally run without auth in a trusted
      local sandbox — this is logged loudly and must never be used in a shared or
      internet-reachable deployment.
    - Signature verification uses PyJWT's ``PyJWKClient`` against the realm JWKS
      endpoint (keys are cached and rotated by the client), so we never trust
      unverified claims.

This module is intentionally self-contained so it can be copied into any A2A agent
without pulling in registry internals.
