/**
 * Composable, presentational card primitives shared by every entity card
 * (servers, agents, skills, virtual servers, custom resources).
 *
 * These hold no entity knowledge — each card composes them and supplies its
 * own badges, stats, actions, and behavior. Colors live in CardShell's accent
 * map and the per-primitive Tailwind classes so the upcoming theming work can
 * route them through CSS variables in one place.
