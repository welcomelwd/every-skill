"""Unit tests for _resolve_allowed_hosts in servers/mcpgw/server.py.

Covers the FastMCP DNS-rebinding host-protection resolution that fixes the
airegistry-tools 421 -> unhealthy -> 405 chain: the mcpgw server is reached
through the registry front door as Host "mcpgw-server", which FastMCP 3.x's
default host protection rejected. The default keeps protection ON and allowlists
that service name; "*" is an opt-in escape hatch that disables protection.

Isolation note: servers/mcpgw/server.py imports `fastmcp` (absent from the main
venv), so it must be stubbed before import. A sibling test file stubs it too and
force-re-imports the module; to avoid cross-file interference we import the
function inside a fixture that snapshots and restores sys.modules, leaving no
cached server module or fastmcp stub behind for other files.
