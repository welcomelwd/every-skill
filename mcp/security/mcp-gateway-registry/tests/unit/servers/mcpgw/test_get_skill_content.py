"""Unit tests for get_skill_content in servers/mcpgw/server.py.

These tests verify that skill_name is validated against a strict identifier
allowlist before being interpolated into the outbound registry URL path
segment. Because this server authenticates to the registry with a privileged
credential, a traversal skill_name (e.g. "../../api/management/iam/users")
would otherwise reach arbitrary registry endpoints with that privilege after
URL normalization. Validation must happen at the interpolation site and must
fail closed (no HTTP request made) on any non-matching value.
