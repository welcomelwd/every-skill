"""Pydantic models for the per-user egress credential vault.

These models are the data contract for the SecretStore, the OAuth engine, and
the egress vend path. The vault is the single source of truth for token state;
there is no companion app-DB metadata table.

Security notes:
- ``StoredToken`` is the secret payload held by the SecretStore. It is NEVER
  returned to API consumers; the non-secret view is ``EgressConnection``.
- The vault key is ``(auth_method, user_id, provider, server_path)``:
  ``auth_method`` discriminates per-user identities (e.g. ``oauth2``) from
  non-per-user callers (``network-trusted``/``federation-static``) so an
  operator-chosen static-key name cannot collide with a real IdP username.
