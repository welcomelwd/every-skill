"""Hardened URL validation and rebinding-safe fetch guard (SSRF protection).

This module is the single source of truth for validating user- and
registry-controlled URLs before the registry stores them or fetches them
server-side. It consolidates the strengths of the previous partial
implementations (``skill_service._is_safe_url`` and
``ard_net_guard.assert_fetchable``) into one fail-closed guard:

- Only ``http`` / ``https`` schemes are accepted.
- The host must resolve **exclusively** to public IP addresses. Private,
  loopback, link-local, reserved, multicast, and unspecified ranges are
  blocked, along with the cloud metadata endpoint (``169.254.169.254``).
- IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (``::ffff:10.0.0.1``) are unwrapped before the
  range check so a private target cannot be smuggled through an IPv6 literal.
- DNS-rebinding is defeated by pinning: the fetch connects only to an IP that
  was validated inside the same transport call, so there is no window between
  the check and the connect for the hostname to rebind to a private address.
  Redirects are re-validated on every hop because httpx re-invokes the pinned
  transport for each redirect.

The guard fails closed: any error, resolution failure, or ambiguity results in
rejection rather than a permissive fallback.

Two validation profiles exist because the registry has two distinct outbound
surfaces:

- **Skill fetches** (``SKILL_PROFILE``): public-only, with an operator bypass
  allowlist read from ``settings.github_extra_hosts`` so GitHub Enterprise
  Server on an internal network stays reachable. Built-in public forge domains
  are NOT auto-trusted — they get full IP validation, closing the
  "internal host masquerading as github.com" bypass.

- **Server / agent targets** (``PROXY_PROFILE``): the same public-only default,
  but operators who legitimately proxy to internal MCP servers can opt those
  targets in via ``settings.ssrf_allowed_hosts`` / ``settings.ssrf_allowed_cidrs``.
  The cloud metadata address is never allowlistable in either profile.
