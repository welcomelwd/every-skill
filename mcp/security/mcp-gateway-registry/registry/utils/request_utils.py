    Extract the client IP from a request behind a trusted reverse proxy.

    Security: the left-most ``X-Forwarded-For`` value is attacker-controlled and
    must never be trusted for audit records. This resolver derives the client IP
    from a NON-SPOOFABLE source and fails toward the direct peer:

    1. ``X-Real-IP`` when present (the bundled nginx sets this to the real
       ``$remote_addr`` and overwrites any client-supplied value).
    2. Otherwise the entry ``TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`` positions from the RIGHT of
       ``X-Forwarded-For`` (the hop our own trusted proxy appended). Client-
       supplied left-most entries are ignored.
    3. Otherwise the direct socket peer (``request.client.host``).

    All candidates are validated as well-formed IP addresses to prevent log
    injection / XSS via crafted headers; a malformed candidate is discarded and
    the next non-spoofable source is used.
