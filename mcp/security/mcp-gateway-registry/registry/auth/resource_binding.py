"""This module centralizes the logic for:
    1. Validating that a user can be issued a token bound to a given
       (resource_type, resource_id) before the token is minted.
    2. Normalizing resource ids so that tokens minted with "/foo" and "foo"
       are treated identically.
    3. Classifying a request URL into a (resource_type, resource_id) pair so
       that route guards can check it against the token's claims.
    4. Deciding whether a path is reachable at all by a resource-bound token
       (vs. blocked endpoints like /api/tokens/generate or /api/admin/*).

``ResourceType`` is the canonical enum shared between the mint endpoint in
``auth_server`` and the edge guard in this module. Keep the enum values
stable — they are persisted inside JWT claims.

Design note — access revocation / TOCTOU:
    Access is verified once at mint time (via
    ``validate_user_can_bind_resource``). At runtime the edge guard only
    checks that the token's claims match the requested URL; it does not
    re-authorize against the user's current scopes. This mirrors how
    regular user JWTs behave — revoking a scope does not invalidate
    already-issued tokens until they expire. The mitigation is the default
    short TTL (8 hours). A future revocation list (jti deny-list) could
    close this window if stronger guarantees are required.
