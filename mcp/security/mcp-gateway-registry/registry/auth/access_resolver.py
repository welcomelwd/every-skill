    Wildcard semantics (mirrors auth_server/server.py):
        - `server: "*"` / `server: "all"` at the rule level is a
          cross-server wildcard. The sentinel "*" is registered in both
          `servers` and `tools` so downstream callers can short-circuit
          without knowing the concrete server name.
        - `tools: ["all"]` / `tools: ["*"]` is a per-server wildcard and
          is recorded as `{"*"}`.
        - A missing `tools` key or a non-list value means "no tools
          allowed" on that server (fail-closed). A startup audit in
          `audit_legacy_scopes_on_startup` warns operators about the
          legacy shape so they can migrate before the tightening bites.

    Wildcards are sticky across scopes: once any scope grants wildcard on
    a server, later scopes cannot narrow it. Non-wildcard tool sets are
