"""Single-use enforcement for internal service-to-service JWTs.

Internal tokens (see :mod:`registry.auth.internal`) are short-lived HS256 JWTs
minted immediately before a single service-to-service HTTP call. Their short TTL
limits — but does not eliminate — a replay window: a network-adjacent attacker on
the internal cluster network who captures a token can re-present it any number of
times until it expires.

This module closes that window by making each internal token **single-use**. Every
minted token carries a unique ``jti`` claim. The first time a token is validated,
its ``jti`` is atomically recorded in a shared MongoDB/DocumentDB collection with a
TTL equal to the token lifetime; a second validation of the same ``jti`` is
rejected as a replay.

Why the shared datastore (not a process-local set):
    The registry and auth-server run as separate processes (and each may run as
    multiple replicas). A captured token could be replayed against a *different*
    replica than the one that first consumed it. A process-local set would not see
    that. The existing MongoDB/DocumentDB backing store is shared across every
    replica of both services, so a unique index on ``jti`` there gives a truly
    cluster-wide single-use guarantee with no new infrastructure dependency.

Fail-closed:
    ``consume_jti`` returns ``False`` (reject the token) when the ``jti`` was
    already seen AND when the store is unreachable or errors. A replay-protection
    layer that silently allows on error is equivalent to no protection, so any
    ambiguity denies. The TTL index reaps consumed entries automatically, so the
    collection stays bounded even under sustained load.
