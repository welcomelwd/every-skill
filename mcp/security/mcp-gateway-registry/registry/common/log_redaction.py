"""Shared redaction helpers for safe logging.

Central chokepoint for scrubbing sensitive data out of values before they are
written to application logs. Application logs land in CI, CloudWatch, and shell
history, so tokens, cookies, credentials, and PII must never be emitted at any
level (INFO, WARNING, or DEBUG).

Use these helpers instead of hand-rolling per-call-site redaction:

- ``redact_headers`` for request/response header mappings (masks
  Authorization / Cookie / API-key headers).
- ``redact_mapping`` for arbitrary dicts (request bodies, ``updates`` payloads,
  user-context dicts) that may carry a token/secret/password under a
  sensitive key.

Fail-safe: prefer logging identifiers and counts over values. When in doubt,
redact.
