"""Compatibility shim for in-process metrics.

Re-exports OpenTelemetry-backed instruments from
``registry.observability.meters`` under the historical names that existing
call sites use.

This shim is temporary and will be deleted in 1.26.0 alongside the
``METRICS_LEGACY_HTTP_POST`` flag. New code should import directly from
``registry.observability.meters``.

Migration notes (issue #1122):
- All ``Counter``-style metrics are now ``_CounterAdapter`` instances wrapping
  OTel ``Counter`` instruments. The legacy ``.labels(...).inc()`` API works
  unchanged.
- ``PEER_SYNC_DURATION_SECONDS`` was a Prometheus ``Gauge`` whose only
  call sites used ``.labels(...).set(duration)``. It is now backed by an
  OTel ``Histogram`` (semantically a one-shot duration measurement). The
  ``_HistogramAdapter`` translates ``.set(value)`` to ``histogram.record``.
- ``DEPLOYMENT_MODE_INFO`` was a Prometheus ``Gauge`` set to 1 once at
  startup. It is now an OTel ``ObservableGauge`` whose callback (see
  ``registry/observability/meters.py``) reads the current deployment mode
  on every export cycle. The historical ``DEPLOYMENT_MODE_INFO`` symbol is
  preserved as a no-op shim so existing call sites still compile; it has
  no effect because the observable gauge handles emission.
- ``PEER_TOKEN_MISSING`` was confirmed dead (zero call sites at migration
  time) and is not re-exported. See follow-up issue #1124.
