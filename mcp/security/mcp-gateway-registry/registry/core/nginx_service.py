    ``TRUSTED_REAL_IP_CIDRS`` is a comma-separated list of CIDRs (or bare IPs)
    identifying the trusted proxy hop(s) directly in front of nginx — typically
    the VPC/subnet CIDR an ALB's ENI lives in. When set, nginx recovers the real
    client IP from ``X-Forwarded-For`` for connections whose immediate peer falls
    in one of these ranges, so the audited client IP is the end user rather than
    the load balancer's internal address.

    Fails closed on bad input: each entry is validated as a well-formed network,
    and any malformed entry is dropped with a warning rather than emitting an
    invalid directive that would break nginx config generation. When the variable
    is unset or yields no valid entries, an EMPTY string is returned — no realip
    directives are emitted, which is the correct behaviour for edge deployments
    (compose / single host) where nginx's peer already IS the client.

    ``real_ip_recursive`` walks the forwarded chain right-to-left skipping the
    trusted CIDRs, stopping at the first untrusted address (the real client). It
    is emitted as ``on`` ONLY when more than one trusted CIDR is configured (a
    stacked-proxy topology, e.g. CloudFront in front of an ALB). For the common
    single-hop case (one ALB) recursion is left off: nginx takes the single
    right-most entry, which is what the one trusted proxy appended, and a spoofed
    left-most entry can never win. Recursion + an over-broad trusted range would
    let a client whose own source falls inside that range inject a left-most
    entry, so we don't enable it unless the topology actually needs it.

    Catch-all ranges (``0.0.0.0/0`` / ``::/0``) are rejected: they would make
    nginx trust EVERY peer and take the spoofable left-most XFF entry — a
    fail-open misconfiguration — so they are dropped with a warning like any other
    invalid entry. Narrow the trust to the load balancer's specific subnet(s).

    """Promote a rendered nginx config only if ``nginx -t`` accepts it.

    A malformed config (whether from a config-injection attempt that still
    parses partially, an unhealthy-backend edge case, or a template bug) must
    never persist on disk: even when the running nginx keeps serving its
    in-memory config, the broken file on disk takes down the *next* cold start
    (routine on ECS/K8s) and with it the whole gateway.

    This renders the candidate to a temporary file, atomically promotes it into
    ``path`` after backing up the current live config, then runs ``nginx -t``
    against the real config tree. If the test passes, the backup is discarded.
    If it fails, the previous last-known-good config is restored (or, when
    there was no prior config, the rejected file is removed) so the gateway can
    still cold-start on the last-good config. Fails closed: any error leaves the
    last-good config in place and raises.

    Args:
        path: The live nginx config path.
        content: The rendered candidate config content.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If ``nginx -t`` rejects the candidate (the live config is
            restored to the last-known-good state before raising).
        OSError: If the temp write / rename cannot be performed.
