"""Shared visibility helpers used by the search route and the
duplicate-check service.

These helpers were previously defined as private functions inside
``registry/api/search_routes.py``. Moving them here lets services
import them without crossing back into the API layer (which would
create a circular import — search_routes imports services).

Each helper returns True iff the caller is allowed to *view* the
entity, given the visibility metadata of that entity and the
caller's auth context (``is_admin``, ``accessible_*`` scope lists,
``username``, ``groups``).
