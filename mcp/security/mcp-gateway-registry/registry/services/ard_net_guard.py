"""SSRF guard for ARD web ingestion (issue #1296, Phase 3).

Every outbound fetch during catalog crawling (the root source URL and every
nested ``application/ai-catalog+json`` URL found inside a fetched document) must
pass :func:`assert_fetchable` first. The guard is intentionally strict:

- ``https`` only (no ``http``/``file``/``gopher``/...).
- The host must resolve **only** to public IPs. The check runs *after* DNS
  resolution, which defeats DNS-rebinding (a hostname that resolves to a public
  IP once and a private IP on the real fetch).
- Optional same-domain restriction for nested recursion, so a compromised
  catalog cannot pivot the crawler to an unrelated host.

Pure logic with the single unavoidable side effect of a DNS lookup; raises
:class:`ArdValidationError` (the same error the ingestion layer treats as a
skip-and-log) on any unsafe URL.
