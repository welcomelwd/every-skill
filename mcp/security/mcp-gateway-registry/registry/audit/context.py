    Set audit action context on the request for the AuditMiddleware.

    This function should be called at the beginning of route handlers

        request: The FastAPI request object
        operation: The operation type (create, read, update, delete, list, toggle, rate, login, logout, search)
        resource_type: The resource type (server, agent, auth, federation, health, search, scope, user, group)
        resource_id: Optional identifier of the resource being acted upon
        description: Optional human-readable description of the action
        idp_skip_reason: When an IdP admin call was intentionally skipped, the
            reason. One of: 'local_only', 'forbidden', 'not_found'.
            See issue #946.

            (e.g., `{'had_if_match': True}`). Persisted on the audit event
            for later analysis.
