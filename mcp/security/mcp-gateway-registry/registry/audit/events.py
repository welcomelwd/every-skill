"""Pydantic audit event models for tool-level access enforcement.

These events are emitted by the tool-filter helper (Issue #1026) whenever
a user-visible tool list is pruned by policy. The events are routed through
`registry.audit.sink.emit_audit_event`, which currently logs them as JSON
at INFO on the `registry.audit` logger. A DB-backed sink can be wired in
later without changing the call sites.
