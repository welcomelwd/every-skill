# Exact request paths of the real monitoring / health endpoints whose GET traffic

# This is an EXACT/PREFIX allowlist, deliberately NOT a "/health" substring test.
# A substring test skipped auditing for any request URL that merely CONTAINED
# "/health" -- including MANAGEMENT-PLANE mutations against a server registered
# under the name "health" (e.g. POST /api/toggle/health,
# POST /api/servers/health/rescan, PATCH /api/servers/health/auth-credential).
# Those routes embed the caller-chosen server path in request.url.path via
# {service_path:path}/{path:path}, so the substring test let an attacker turn a
# mutating admin action into an un-audited one. Matching the known health routes
# exactly closes that bypass while preserving legitimate health-check suppression.
#
# MUST stay in sync with the actual monitoring routes:
