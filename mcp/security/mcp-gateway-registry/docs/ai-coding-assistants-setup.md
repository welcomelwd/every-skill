# AI Coding Assistants Setup Guide

Complete guide for integrating the MCP Gateway & Registry with popular AI development tools.

## Overview

The MCP Gateway automatically generates configuration files for various AI coding assistants, enabling seamless access to enterprise-curated MCP servers with proper authentication and governance.

## How coding assistants connect (three methods)

A coding assistant connecting to a gateway-protected MCP server needs an OAuth
`client_id` to start the login flow. There are three ways to provide it. They are
not ranked alternatives - each fits a different scale and IdP posture. Pick based
on your deployment.

| Method | Who creates the OAuth client | When | Best for | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Pre-registered public client id](connection-methods/client-id.md) | An operator, once | Ahead of time | Enterprise registries; IdPs with DCR disabled | Supported |
| [Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)](connection-methods/dynamic-client-registration.md) | The IDE, automatically | At connect time | Public / multi-tenant registries | Supported |
| [Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD)](connection-methods/client-id-metadata-documents.md) | Nobody (id is a URL) | At connect time | Zero-touch without client sprawl | Coming soon |

Short version:

- **Pre-registered public client id** - an operator registers one public PKCE
  client and the registry advertises its id (`IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, or per-server
  `oauth_client_id`). Simple, no client sprawl, full per-user audit. The right
  default for an enterprise registry, and the only option when the IdP has
  anonymous DCR disabled.
- **DCR** - the IDE self-registers a client on the fly. Zero-touch and scalable,
  but needs DCR enabled and creates client sprawl in the IdP.
- **CIMD** - the `client_id` is an `https` URL to a metadata document; nothing is
  registered. Zero-touch with no sprawl, but newest and least supported. Not yet
  implemented here.

In all three, the user logs in as themselves in the browser and the IDE receives
a **per-user** token; the client id only identifies the application, not the
user. Actual access is derived from the token's `groups` claim, not from the
requested OAuth scopes.

### Compatibility matrix: coding assistant x identity provider

Which connection method works for each coding assistant against each IdP. **CIMD
(Client ID Metadata Documents) is not yet implemented; it is on the roadmap** -
so it is omitted from the cells below. Each cell lists the methods that work
today.

Legend: **Client ID** = pre-registered public client (`IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`).
**DCR** = Dynamic Client Registration. A "fixed port" note means the IdP requires
`IDE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT` and only Claude Code can honor it.

| Coding assistant | Keycloak | Amazon Cognito | Okta | Microsoft Entra ID |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** | Client ID + DCR | Client ID (fixed port) | Client ID (fixed port) | Not yet (blocked on #990) |
| **Cursor** | Client ID + DCR | Static token only | Static token only | Not yet (blocked on #990) |
| **Codex** | Client ID + DCR | Static token only | Static token only | Not yet (blocked on #990) |
| **Other IDEs** | DCR (if the IDE supports it) | Static token | Static token | Not yet |

Notes:

- **Keycloak** is the most flexible: it accepts a wildcard loopback redirect
  (`http://localhost/*`), so no fixed port is needed, and it supports anonymous
  DCR. Both methods work for all assistants.
- **Cognito / Okta** match the redirect URI literally (including the port), so the
  Client ID method requires a fixed callback port (`IDE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT`).
  Only **Claude Code** can pin the port (`--callback-port`), so it is the only
  assistant that completes the Client ID login flow there today. Codex has no
  port-pinning flag and Cursor's JSON config has no port field, so they use a
  random port that fails the literal redirect match - they fall back to the
  static gateway token.
- The Connect dialog only presents the **DCR**-style (token-less) config when the
  provider is **Keycloak** (the dialog treats `auth_provider == "keycloak"` as
  "DCR available"; see
  [the DCR method doc](connection-methods/dynamic-client-registration.md#how-the-connect-dialog-decides-to-rely-on-dcr-important-nuance)).
  So for Cognito/Okta, non-Claude-Code assistants get the static-token config,
  not DCR, even though those IdPs technically support DCR.
- **Entra** IDE login is blocked pending resource-qualified PRM scopes (issue
  #990), regardless of assistant.
- Validated this release: Keycloak (Client ID + DCR), Cognito (Client ID with
  Claude Code, on ECS), Okta (Client ID with Claude Code). See
  [the client-id method doc](connection-methods/client-id.md#per-idp-setup) for
  per-IdP setup.

### Custom MCP Clients

For custom applications or other MCP clients:

**Use Raw Authentication:**
```bash
# Access authentication details directly
cat .oauth-tokens/ingress.json
```

**Example Integration:**
```python
import json
import mcp
from mcp.client.sse import sse_client

# Load authentication from generated file
with open('.oauth-tokens/ingress.json') as f:
    auth = json.load(f)

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {auth["access_token"]}',
    'X-User-Pool-Id': auth['user_pool_id'],
    'X-Client-Id': auth['client_id'],
    'X-Region': auth['region']
}

# Connect to MCP server
async with sse_client('https://gateway.com/mcpgw/sse', headers=headers) as (read, write):
    async with mcp.ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        tools = await session.list_tools()
```

## Configuration Management

### Automatic Token Refresh

The MCP Gateway includes an [Automated Token Refresh Service](token-refresh-service.md) that provides continuous token management:

```bash
# Start the token refresh service (runs in background)
./start_token_refresher.sh

# Service automatically:
# - Monitors token expiration (1-hour buffer by default)
# - Refreshes tokens before they expire
# - Updates all MCP client configurations
# - Generates fresh configs for all AI assistants
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Zero Downtime**: Tokens refresh automatically before expiration
- **Continuous Operation**: AI assistants never lose access due to expired tokens
- **Multiple Client Support**: Updates configurations for VS Code, Roo Code, Claude Code, etc.
- **Background Operation**: Runs as a service with comprehensive logging

### Manual Configuration Updates

If you need to manually regenerate configurations:

```bash
# Regenerate all configurations
./credentials-provider/generate_creds.sh

# Copy updated configurations to AI assistants
./scripts/update-ai-assistants.sh  # Custom script you can create
```

**For AI assistants using symbolic links** (recommended setup), configuration updates are automatic since they point to the live `.oauth-tokens/` files.

### Environment-Specific Configurations

**Development Environment:**
```bash
# Generate development configurations
ENVIRONMENT=dev ./credentials-provider/generate_creds.sh
cp .oauth-tokens/dev-* ~/.vscode/
```

**Production Environment:**
```bash
# Generate production configurations
ENVIRONMENT=prod ./credentials-provider/generate_creds.sh
cp .oauth-tokens/prod-* ~/.vscode/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

**Token Expired:**

*If using Token Refresh Service (recommended):*
```bash
# Check if token refresh service is running
ps aux | grep token_refresher

# Restart token refresh service if needed
./start_token_refresher.sh

# Check service logs
tail -f token_refresher.log
```

*Manual token refresh:*
```bash
# Regenerate credentials
./credentials-provider/generate_creds.sh
# Update AI assistant configurations
```

**Permission Denied:**
```bash
# Check user permissions in Cognito
aws cognito-idp admin-list-groups-for-user \
  --user-pool-id YOUR_POOL_ID \
  --username YOUR_USERNAME

# Verify scope configuration in the mcp_scopes collection (DocumentDB / MongoDB)
# Scopes are seeded from the JSON scope seed files in scripts/, or managed via the scope management API
```

### Configuration Issues

**Tools Not Appearing:**
```bash
# Verify MCP server health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  https://your-gateway.com/server-name/sse

# Check AI assistant logs
tail -f ~/.vscode/logs/mcp.log
```

**Connection Failures:**
```bash
# Test gateway connectivity
./tests/mcp_cmds.sh ping

# Verify SSL certificates (if using HTTPS)
openssl s_client -connect your-gateway.com:443
```

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Credential Storage**
   - Store generated configurations in secure locations
   - Use environment-specific credentials
   - Regularly rotate authentication tokens

2. **Access Control**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Regularly review user permissions
   - Monitor tool usage for anomalies

3. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production environments
   - Restrict network access to authorized IP ranges
   - Monitor for unauthorized access attempts

### Development Workflow

1. **Team Onboarding**
   ```bash
   # Create onboarding script
   #!/bin/bash
   ./credentials-provider/generate_creds.sh
   cp .oauth-tokens/vscode-mcp.json ~/.vscode/settings.json
   echo "MCP Gateway configured successfully!"
   ```

2. **Tool Discovery**
   - Use natural language queries: "find tools for database operations"
   - Explore available tools through web interface
   - Share useful tool combinations with team

3. **Automation**
   ```bash
   # Automate configuration updates
   crontab -e
   # Add: 0 9 * * * /path/to/update-mcp-config.sh
   ```

## Enterprise Deployment Considerations

### Scale Considerations

- **Large Teams (100+ developers)**: Consider load balancing and caching
- **Global Teams**: Deploy regional gateways for reduced latency
- **High Security**: Use private networking and enhanced monitoring

### Compliance & Governance

- **Audit Requirements**: Enable comprehensive logging
- **Data Residency**: Deploy in compliant regions
- **Access Reviews**: Implement periodic permission audits

### Cost Optimization

- **Resource Management**: Monitor gateway resource usage
- **Tool Usage**: Analyze tool usage patterns for optimization
- **License Management**: Track per-developer tool usage

## Backend Server Authentication

When MCP servers require their own authentication (API keys, bearer tokens, etc.), the MCP Gateway Registry provides automatic configuration generation that includes both:

1. **Gateway Authentication** - The `X-Authorization` header for authenticating with the MCP Gateway
2. **Backend Server Authentication** - The server's own auth header (`Authorization`, custom API key headers, etc.)

### Supported Authentication Schemes

The registry supports three backend authentication schemes:

| Scheme | Description | Example Header |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `none` | No backend authentication required | N/A |
| `bearer` | Bearer token authentication | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| `api_key` | API key with custom header | `CONTEXT7_API_KEY: <key>` or `X-API-Key: <key>` |

### Example Configurations

#### Example 1: API Key Authentication (Context7)

**Server Details:**
- **Display Name**: Context7
- **Auth Scheme**: `api_key`
- **Auth Header**: `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`
- **Credential**: API key provided during registration

**Generated MCP Configuration (VS Code):**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcpgateway.ddns.net/context7/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "[YOUR_API_KEY]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Generated MCP Configuration (Roo Code/Cline):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcpgateway.ddns.net/context7/mcp",
      "disabled": false,
      "headers": {
        "X-Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "[YOUR_API_KEY]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example 2: Bearer Token Authentication (Cloudflare)

**Server Details:**
- **Display Name**: Cloudflare API
- **Auth Scheme**: `bearer`
- **Auth Header**: `Authorization`
- **Credential**: Bearer token provided during registration

**Generated MCP Configuration (VS Code):**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "cloudflare-api": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcpgateway.ddns.net/cloudflare-api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
        "Authorization": "Bearer [YOUR_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Gateway Authentication Header** (`X-Authorization`):
   - Authenticates the AI coding assistant with the MCP Gateway
   - Automatically generated when you open the MCP Configuration modal
   - Validates user identity and permissions

2. **Backend Server Authentication Header** (e.g., `Authorization`, `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`):
   - Authenticates the MCP Gateway with the backend MCP server
   - The credential is encrypted and stored in the registry during server registration
   - Automatically decrypted and included in health checks and tool fetching

3. **Automatic Configuration Generation**:
   - The Registry UI automatically detects the server's auth scheme
   - Both headers are included in the generated configuration
   - Works with all supported AI coding assistants (VS Code, Cursor, Cline, Roo Code, Claude Code)

### UI Workflow

1. **Open Server Card** in the Registry dashboard
2. **Click "Get MCP Config"** button
3. **Select Your IDE** (VS Code, Cursor, Cline, Roo Code, or Claude Code)
4. **Copy Configuration** - The generated config includes both gateway and backend auth headers
5. **Paste into your IDE's MCP settings file**

**Screenshot Example:**


### Registry-Only Mode

In registry-only deployment mode (catalog mode), only the backend server authentication is included:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://context7-direct-endpoint.com/mcp",
      "disabled": false,
      "headers": {
        "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "[YOUR_API_KEY]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [Registry Deployment Modes](registry-deployment-modes.md) for more details on deployment configurations.
