**KMS Key Architecture:**

Three dedicated KMS keys with distinct purposes:
1. **DocumentDB Key** (`alias/mcp-gateway-documentdb`)
   - Encrypts DocumentDB cluster
   - Encrypts DocumentDB credentials in Secrets Manager
   - Encrypts related SSM parameters

2. **RDS Key** (`alias/keycloak-rds`)
   - Encrypts RDS PostgreSQL database
   - Encrypts RDS credentials in Secrets Manager
   - Encrypts Keycloak configuration parameters

3. **Gateway Secrets Key** (module-specific)

   - Encrypts JWT signing keys
   - Encrypts session encryption keys

**Key Management Features:**
- ✅ Automatic key rotation enabled (annual rotation)
- ✅ Restrictive key policies following least-privilege principle
- ✅ CloudTrail logging of all key usage
- ✅ Cross-account access controls
- ✅ Key deletion protection with 7-day waiting period

### Encryption in Transit

**🟨 Universal**

All network communication uses TLS encryption:

**TLS Configuration:**
- **External Traffic**: TLS 1.2+ enforced on all ALBs (ECS) / Ingress controllers (EKS) and CloudFront distributions
- **Internal Traffic**: TLS connections to DocumentDB (ECS) / MongoDB-CE (EKS) and RDS
- **API Communication**: HTTPS-only for all REST API endpoints
- **MCP Protocol**: Encrypted SSE (Server-Sent Events) over HTTPS

**S3 Bucket Policies** (ECS):
- TLS enforcement via bucket policies (deny all non-HTTPS requests)
- Applied to all S3 buckets (logs, artifacts, backups)

---

## Secrets Management & Rotation

**🟦 ECS Deployment** | **🟨 Universal (Application-Level)**

### Automated Secret Rotation

**🟦 ECS Deployment Only**

Credentials are automatically rotated on a 30-day schedule using AWS Lambda functions, eliminating manual password management and reducing credential exposure windows.

**Rotation Implementation:**

---

## Network Security

**🟦 ECS Deployment (AWS-specific)** | **🟨 Universal (Concepts)**

### Public Access Prevention

**🟦 ECS Deployment**

All storage resources are protected against public exposure:

**S3 Bucket Security:**
- Public access completely blocked on all buckets
- Bucket policies deny any public ACLs or policies
- Applied to:
  - ALB access logs bucket
  - CloudFront access logs bucket
  - CodeBuild artifacts bucket
  - Backup storage buckets

**Database Access:**
- **DocumentDB** (ECS): Cluster deployed in private subnets (no public endpoint)
- **MongoDB-CE** (EKS): Pod-to-pod communication within cluster, no external exposure
- **RDS PostgreSQL** (ECS/EKS): Deployed in private subnets (no public endpoint)
- Security groups (ECS) / Network Policies (EKS) allow connections only from authorized workloads

### Security Groups & Network Segmentation

**🟦 ECS Deployment**

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Dedicated security groups per service layer
- Ingress rules limited to specific ports and source security groups
- Egress rules restricted to required destinations only

**Security Group Architecture:**
```
[ALB Security Group]
  ↓ TCP 8080 (HTTP)
[Registry ECS Security Group]
  ↓ TCP 27017 (MongoDB)
[DocumentDB Security Group]

[ALB Security Group]
  ↓ TCP 8080 (HTTP)
[Auth Server ECS Security Group]
  ↓ TCP 5432 (PostgreSQL)
[RDS Security Group]
```

**Lambda Function Security (ECS):**
- Secret rotation Lambdas deployed in VPC
- Dedicated security group with minimal permissions
- Access to databases via security group rules only

**🟩 EKS Deployment**

**Kubernetes Network Policies:**
- Define ingress/egress rules for pods
- Restrict pod-to-pod communication
- Isolate application tiers (frontend, backend, database)
- Default deny-all with explicit allow rules

---

---

## Container Hardening

**🟨 Universal (All Deployments)**

### CIS Docker Benchmark Compliance

All container images are hardened following CIS Docker Benchmark 4.1 requirements, regardless of deployment platform (ECS, EKS, Docker Compose).

**Non-Root User Execution:**

Every container runs as a non-privileged user (UID 1000):

```dockerfile
# Create non-root user early for security
RUN groupadd -g 1000 appuser && useradd -u 1000 -g appuser appuser

# Copy files with correct ownership (fast, secure)
COPY --from=builder --chown=appuser:appuser /app/.venv /app/.venv

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser
```

**Container Images Secured (12 total):**
- Registry service (with nginx)
- Auth server
- MCP servers (3 variants: GPU, CPU, lightweight)
- Metrics service
- Keycloak
- Database initialization containers
- Grafana

**Security Controls Per Container:**
- ✅ Non-root user execution (CIS 4.1)
- ✅ No sudo package installed
- ✅ Health checks configured (CIS 4.6)
- ✅ Multi-stage builds (minimal attack surface)
- ✅ No build tools in runtime images
- ✅ Minimal base images (python:3.14-slim)

### Container Runtime Security

**Docker Compose Security Options:**

```yaml
services:
  registry:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    ports:
      - "80:8080"    # High port for non-root
      - "443:8443"   # High port for non-root
```

**Security Features:**
- `no-new-privileges:true` - Prevents privilege escalation
- `cap_drop: ALL` - Drops all Linux capabilities
- High port binding (8080, 8443) - Non-root operation
- Read-only root filesystem (where possible)

**MongoDB Capability Exception:**

MongoDB requires `SETUID` and `SETGID` capabilities because its entrypoint uses `gosu` to drop privileges from `root` to the `mongodb` user at startup. Without these capabilities, MongoDB fails with:

```text
error: failed switching to 'mongodb': operation not permitted
```

The correct least-privilege pattern is to drop all capabilities and then explicitly add back only the minimum required:

```yaml
  mongodb:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - SETUID   # Required by gosu to switch to mongodb user at startup
      - SETGID   # Required by gosu to switch to mongodb group at startup
```

This follows CIS Docker Benchmark guidance: explicitly enumerate the minimum capabilities a container needs rather than leaving it with a broad default set.

### Image Supply Chain

**Image Signing & Verification:**
- Official images published to Docker Hub
- Versioned releases with semantic versioning
- Automated builds via GitHub Actions
- Container vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

---

## Kubernetes Security

**🟩 EKS Deployment Only**

### Pod Security Standards

All Kubernetes Pods implement Pod Security Standards (PSS) at the **Restricted** level - the most stringent security profile.

**Pod-Level Security Context:**

```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 1000
    fsGroup: 1000
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
```

**Container-Level Security Context:**

```yaml
containers:
  - name: container
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      runAsNonRoot: true
      runAsUser: 1000
      capabilities:
        drop:
          - ALL
```

**Security Controls:**
- ✅ **runAsNonRoot**: Prevents containers from running as root
- ✅ **Drop ALL Capabilities**: Removes all Linux capabilities
- ✅ **No Privilege Escalation**: Blocks privilege escalation attempts
- ✅ **Seccomp Profile**: Restricts system calls
- ✅ **Read-Only Root Filesystem**: Where application permits

**Helm Charts Secured:**
- Registry Deployment
- Auth Server Deployment
- MCP Gateway (mcpgw) Deployment

## Application Security

**🟨 Universal (All Deployments)**

### Secure Coding Practices

The application codebase follows secure coding standards validated by automated security scanning, regardless of deployment platform.

**Bandit Static Analysis:**

All Python code is continuously scanned with Bandit security linter to detect:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Command injection risks
- Hardcoded credentials
- Insecure cryptographic functions
- Subprocess misuse
- Unsafe deserialization
- And 50+ other security patterns

**Security Issues Addressed:**

**Subprocess Security:**
- Always use list form (never `shell=True`)
- Validate command arguments against allowlists
- Add timeouts to prevent DoS
- Proper error handling with logging

```python
# Secure subprocess pattern
result = subprocess.run(
    ["nginx", "-s", "reload"],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
    timeout=5,
)
```

**SQL Injection Prevention:**
- Parameterized queries for all database operations
- Table/column name validation against allowlists
- No string interpolation in SQL statements

```python
# Secure SQL pattern
table = validate_table_name(table)  # Allowlist check
query = f"DELETE FROM {table} WHERE created_at < ?"
cursor.execute(query, (cutoff,))
```

**Request Timeout Protection:**
- All HTTP requests include timeout parameters
- Prevents resource exhaustion DoS attacks
- Default 30-second timeout for external APIs

**Secure Configuration:**
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- All sensitive config via environment variables
- Bind addresses configurable (default 127.0.0.1)
- TLS-only communication in production

### Dependency Management

**Vulnerability Scanning:**
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Regular updates for security patches
- Pinned versions for reproducible builds

**Python Dependencies:**
- `uv` package manager for fast, reproducible installs
- `pyproject.toml` for dependency management
- No pip cache to reduce image size

## Summary

The MCP Gateway & Registry implements enterprise-grade security across all layers:

✅ **Encryption Everywhere** - At rest (KMS) and in transit (TLS)
✅ **Zero-Trust Architecture** - Identity verification, least-privilege access
✅ **Defense-in-Depth** - Multiple security layers at infrastructure, application, and container levels
✅ **Automated Secrets Management** - 30-day rotation, encrypted storage
✅ **Comprehensive Logging** - ALB, CloudFront, DocumentDB, application audit logs
✅ **Supply Chain Security** - Automated scanning of third-party MCP servers
✅ **Container Hardening** - CIS benchmark compliance, non-root execution
✅ **Proactive Monitoring** - CloudWatch alarms, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards
✅ **Compliance Ready** - SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR controls

This security posture enables enterprises to confidently deploy AI agent infrastructure while maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data.

**Legend:**
- ✅ Fully supported and implemented
- ⚠️ Partially supported or requires configuration
- ❌ Not applicable for this platform
- *EKS can optionally use KMS for Kubernetes secrets encryption via encryption provider
- *MongoDB-CE audit logging can be enabled in configuration

**Key Differences:**
- **ECS**: Uses AWS-native services (ALB, DocumentDB, Secrets Manager, Lambda, CloudWatch)
- **EKS**: Uses Kubernetes-native features (Network Policies, PSS, Ingress, MongoDB-CE)
- **Universal**: Application-level controls work across all platforms
