# Registration Webhooks and Gate

MCP Gateway Registry provides two external integration points for registration lifecycle events: **notification webhooks** that fire after a registration or deletion, and a **registration gate** (admission control) that can approve or deny registrations and updates before they are persisted.

## Notification Webhooks

MCP Gateway Registry can send HTTP webhook notifications when servers, agents, or skills are registered (added) or deleted (removed). This enables external systems to react to registry changes in real time, for example updating a CMDB, triggering a CI/CD pipeline, sending a Slack notification, or syncing with a third-party inventory.

## Overview

Registration webhooks are **fire-and-forget**: the registry sends an async POST to a configurable URL after a successful registration or deletion, logs the result, and moves on. A webhook failure never blocks or rolls back the operation that triggered it.

### Supported Events

| Event Type | Trigger | Asset Types |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `registration` | A new asset is added to the registry | server, agent, skill |
| `update` | An existing asset's metadata is edited (PUT/PATCH) | server, agent, skill |
| `deletion` | An existing asset is removed from the registry | server, agent, skill |
| `scan_complete` | The async security scan finishes after registration | server, agent, skill |

The `scan_complete` event (Issue #1330) is the registry's second outbound webhook in the
lifecycle workflow: the first integration point is the synchronous **registration gate**
("quick checks"), and `scan_complete` reports the asynchronous security-scan result once it
finishes. Lifecycle status transitions (draft to beta to active to deprecated) are driven by
the operator via PATCH and deliberately emit **no** webhook.

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Delivery model | Fire-and-forget | Registry availability is never affected by webhook failures |
| Failure handling | Log at WARNING level | Operators can monitor via CloudWatch or log aggregation |
| Auth header handling | Auto-prefix Bearer for Authorization header | Follows RFC 6750 convention without extra config |
| HTTPS enforcement | Warn but allow HTTP | Avoids breaking dev/test setups while flagging insecure production use |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_URL` | string | `""` (disabled) | Full URL to POST to. Only `http://` and `https://` schemes are accepted. Leave empty to disable. |
| `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER` | string | `Authorization` | Name of the HTTP header used for authentication. If set to `Authorization`, the token is auto-prefixed with `Bearer `. For any other header (e.g. `X-API-Key`), the token is sent as-is. |
| `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN` | string | `""` | Auth token value. Leave empty for unauthenticated webhooks. |
| `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | int | `10` | HTTP timeout per request in seconds. |
| `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` | string | `""` (disabled) | Shared secret for HMAC-SHA256 signing of the payload. When set, an `X-Registry-Signature: sha256=<hex>` header is added over the exact transmitted body. |
| `REGISTRATION_ENFORCED_STATUS` | string | `""` (disabled) | When set (e.g. `draft`), mandates the initial lifecycle status for new registrations; a mismatched status fails with 4xx. |

### Example Configurations

**Unauthenticated webhook (dev/test):**

```bash
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.example.com/registry
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER=Authorization
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10
```

**Bearer token authentication:**

```bash
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.example.com/registry
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER=Authorization
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=my-secret-bearer-token
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=10
```

The request will include `Authorization: Bearer my-secret-bearer-token`.

**Custom API key header:**

```bash
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.example.com/registry
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER=X-API-Key
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=my-api-key-value
REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
```

The request will include `X-API-Key: my-api-key-value`.

## Webhook Payload

Every webhook POST sends a JSON body with the following structure:

```json
{
    "event_type": "registration",
    "registration_type": "agent",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-23T14:30:00.000000+00:00",
    "performed_by": "admin@example.com",
    "card": {
        "name": "My Agent",
        "path": "/agents/my-agent",
        "description": "An example A2A agent",
        "...": "full card data as stored in the registry"
    }
}
```

### Payload Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `event_type` | string | `"registration"` (asset added) or `"deletion"` (asset removed) |
| `registration_type` | string | `"server"`, `"agent"`, or `"skill"` |
| `timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp in UTC |
| `performed_by` | string or null | Username of the operator who performed the action (null if unknown) |
| `card` | object | The full card JSON as stored in the registry |

### HTTP Request Details

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Method | `POST` |
| Content-Type | `application/json` |
| Timeout | Configurable via `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` |
| Retries | None (fire-and-forget) |
| TLS verification | Enabled by default (httpx default behavior) |

## Deployment Configuration

The webhook environment variables must be set on the **registry** service (not the auth server).

### Docker Compose

All three Compose files (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.podman.yml`, `docker-compose.prebuilt.yml`) pass the variables to the `mcp-gateway-registry` service:

```yaml
services:
  mcp-gateway-registry:
    environment:
      - REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_URL=${REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_URL:-}
      - REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER=${REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER:-Authorization}
      - REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN=${REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN:-}
      - REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=${REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:-10}
```

### Terraform / ECS

The variables are defined in `terraform/aws-ecs/variables.tf` and wired into the registry ECS task definition via `terraform/aws-ecs/modules/mcp-gateway/ecs-services.tf` (inside `module "ecs_service_registry"`).

Set values in `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
registration_webhook_url             = "https://hooks.example.com/registry"
registration_webhook_auth_header     = "X-API-Key"
registration_webhook_auth_token      = "my-api-key"
registration_webhook_timeout_seconds = 10
```

For sensitive values (tokens), use AWS Secrets Manager references instead of plaintext in tfvars.

### Helm / EKS

The variables are defined in `charts/registry/values.yaml` and mapped in the deployment template and secret:

```yaml
# charts/registry/values.yaml
registrationWebhook:
  url: ""
  authHeader: "Authorization"
  authToken: ""
  timeoutSeconds: 10
```

Sensitive values (auth tokens) are stored in the Kubernetes secret (`charts/registry/templates/secret.yaml`) and injected via `secretKeyRef`.

## Logging and Observability

The webhook service logs at three levels:

| Level | Condition | Example Message |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| INFO | Webhook sent successfully | `Registration webhook sent: event=registration, type=agent, status=200, url=https://...` |
| WARNING | Timeout or connection failure | `Registration webhook timed out after 10s: event=registration, type=agent, url=https://...` |
| WARNING | HTTP (not HTTPS) URL configured | `Registration webhook URL uses HTTP (not HTTPS). Credential data may be transmitted insecurely.` |
| ERROR | Invalid URL scheme | `Invalid webhook URL scheme: ftp://...` |

In ECS deployments, these log messages appear in the registry task's CloudWatch Log Group.

## Building a Webhook Receiver

A minimal webhook receiver only needs to accept a POST with a JSON body and return a 2xx status code. Here is a Python example:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def handle_webhook(request: Request):
    payload = await request.json()
    event = payload.get("event_type")
    asset_type = payload.get("registration_type")
    card = payload.get("card", {})
    name = card.get("name") or card.get("display_name", "unknown")

    print(f"Received {event} event for {asset_type}: {name}")

    # Your custom logic here:
    # - Send a Slack notification
    # - Update a CMDB
    # - Trigger a CI/CD pipeline
    # - Sync with an external inventory

    return {"status": "ok"}
```

Run with: `uvicorn receiver:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6789`

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No webhook logs at all | `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_URL` is empty or not set | Set the variable in the correct service |
| Webhook env vars set but no calls | Variables on the wrong ECS service | Ensure they are on the **registry** service, not the auth server |
| Timeout warnings | Receiver too slow or unreachable | Increase `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` or check network connectivity |
| HTTP warning in logs | URL uses `http://` instead of `https://` | Switch to HTTPS for production |

## Lifecycle Workflow (Issue #1330)

This section covers the additions that let an external orchestrator drive the asset
lifecycle (draft to beta to active to deprecated) entirely on registry events and APIs.

### The `scan_complete` event

After an asset is registered, the registry runs an asynchronous security scan. When the
scan finishes (whether the asset is safe, unsafe, or the scan errored), the registry fires a
`scan_complete` webhook. This is the signal an external CI/CD pipeline should act on, rather
than polling `GET /api/servers/{path}/security-scan`.

```json
{
    "event_type": "scan_complete",
    "registration_type": "server",
    "timestamp": "2026-06-25T14:30:00Z",
    "performed_by": "alice",
    "card": { "...sanitized card..." },
    "scan": {
        "is_safe": true,
        "severity_counts": { "critical": 0, "high": 0, "medium": 2, "low": 5 },
        "tags_applied": [],
        "auto_disabled": false,
        "scan_error": null
    }
}
```

- `is_safe`: `true`/`false`, or `null` when the scan itself errored.
- `tags_applied`: e.g. `["security-pending"]` when the scan flagged the asset.
- `auto_disabled`: `true` when the asset was disabled because it failed the scan and
  `SECURITY_BLOCK_UNSAFE_SERVERS` (or the agent/skill equivalent) is enabled.
- `scan_error`: a short, sanitized message when the scan raised (never a stack trace).

### Signature verification

When `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` is set, every outbound webhook carries an
`X-Registry-Signature: sha256=<hex>` header computed as HMAC-SHA256 over the exact bytes of
the request body. Verify with a constant-time compare:

```python
import hmac
import hashlib


def verify(raw_body: bytes, header_sig: str, secret: str) -> bool:
    expected = "sha256=" + hmac.new(secret.encode(), raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, header_sig)  # constant-time
```

Compute the signature over the **raw request body** (the exact bytes received), not a
re-serialized copy, or the digest will not match.

### Event ordering, idempotency, and replay

- **Not ordered.** Events are fire-and-forget with no retry. A consumer may receive
  `scan_complete` before `registration`. Key off `card.path` + `event_type` and be
  idempotent. Treat the registry as the source of truth and reconcile via
  `GET /api/servers?status=...` rather than relying on delivery.
- **No durability.** A dropped delivery is not retried. The reconciliation poll above is the
  backstop; do not treat a missing event as "nothing happened".
- **Replay protection.** The signature covers the body, which includes `timestamp`.
  Consumers should reject events whose `timestamp` is outside a small skew window (e.g. 5
  minutes) to limit replay of captured signed events.
- **Secret rotation.** Rotating `REGISTRATION_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` is a hard cutover. To
  rotate without dropped events, have the consumer temporarily accept both the old and new
  secret during the rotation window.

### Mandating an initial status

Set `REGISTRATION_ENFORCED_STATUS=draft` so that every new asset must start as `draft`. A
registration with no status is forced to `draft`; a registration with a different explicit
status fails with HTTP 400. This lets an operator guarantee nothing becomes `active` without
going through an external promotion pipeline. The default (unset) preserves current behavior
(new assets default to `active`, except skills which already default to `draft`).

### Separating "register" from "promote"

Changing an asset's lifecycle `status` via `PUT`/`PATCH` requires a dedicated
`change_lifecycle_status` UI permission, separate from `modify_service`. This lets a scope
grant "register and edit metadata" without granting "promote/deprecate":

- A scope with `register_service` but **without** `change_lifecycle_status` can register and
  edit an asset, but receives 403 when a request changes the `status` field.
- Admins always pass (existing admin scopes predate this permission).
- Ordinary metadata edits (description, tags, URL) are unaffected and stay under
  `modify_service`.

### Building the review queue

`GET /api/servers?status=draft` (or `status=beta`) returns only assets at that lifecycle
status, for an admin "review queue". `status=active` also matches legacy documents that have
no `status` field. The filter is applied for both unrestricted and permission-restricted
users.

### Delivery metric

`webhook_send_total{event_type, outcome}` counts every outbound webhook by event type and
outcome (`success`, `timeout`, `error`, `skipped_no_url`) so operators can detect a silently
unreachable consumer endpoint. `registration_status_rejected_total{registration_type}` counts
registrations rejected by the enforced-status policy.

## Registration Gate (Admission Control)

![Registration Gate Configuration](img/registration-gate.png)

The **registration gate** is an admission control webhook called **before** a registration or update is persisted. Unlike the notification webhook above (which fires after the fact and cannot block the operation), the registration gate can **approve or deny** a request based on custom business logic such as naming conventions, compliance rules, or approval workflows.

### How It Differs from the Notification Webhook

| Aspect | Notification Webhook | Registration Gate |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Timing | After the registration is persisted | Before the registration is persisted |
| Can block registration | No (fire-and-forget) | Yes (approve/deny) |
| Failure behavior | Logged, never blocks caller | Fail-closed: blocks registration if gate is unavailable |
| Retries | None | Configurable with exponential backoff |
| Applies to | Registration and deletion events | Registration and update events |
| Credential handling | Full card data sent | Credentials stripped from payload |

### Capabilities

- Approve or deny registrations and updates for servers, agents, and skills
- Configurable authentication: none, API key, or Bearer token
- Fail-closed design: if the gate is unreachable after retries, registration is blocked
- Custom denial messages returned to the caller as HTTP 403
- Sensitive fields (credentials, tokens, passwords) are automatically stripped from the payload sent to the gate
- Exponential backoff retries (0.5s, 1s, 2s, ...)
- Startup connectivity check (non-blocking, logs warnings if gate is unreachable)

### Gate Protocol

The registry sends a POST request to the gate URL with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "asset_type": "agent",
  "operation": "register",
  "source_api": "/api/agents/register",
  "registration_payload": { ... },
  "request_headers": { "host": "...", "content-type": "..." }
}
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `asset_type` | `"agent"`, `"server"`, or `"skill"` |
| `operation` | `"register"` or `"update"` |
| `source_api` | The API path that triggered the request |
| `registration_payload` | The registration data with sensitive fields removed |
| `request_headers` | HTTP headers from the original request (sensitive headers excluded) |

**Gate Response Codes:**

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `200` | Registration allowed |
| `403` | Registration denied. Response body may include `{"error": "reason"}` |
| Any other | Triggers retry (unexpected status) |

### Credential Sanitization

The following fields are automatically removed from `registration_payload` before sending to the gate:

- Fields named: `auth_credential`, `auth_credential_encrypted`, `auth_header_name`
- Fields containing: `credential`, `secret`, `token`, `password`, `api_key`

Sensitive request headers are also excluded: `authorization`, `cookie`, `x-csrf-token`.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable/disable the gate |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_URL` | (empty) | URL of the gate endpoint. Must be set when enabled |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_AUTH_TYPE` | `none` | Auth type: `none`, `api_key`, `bearer`, or `oauth2_client_credentials` |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_AUTH_CREDENTIAL` | (empty) | API key or Bearer token value (for `api_key` or `bearer` auth) |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_AUTH_HEADER_NAME` | `X-Api-Key` | Header name for `api_key` auth type |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `5` | HTTP timeout per attempt (seconds) |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_MAX_RETRIES` | `2` | Retry attempts after first failure (exponential backoff) |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL` | (empty) | OAuth2 token endpoint URL (required for `oauth2_client_credentials`) |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` | (empty) | OAuth2 client ID (required for `oauth2_client_credentials`) |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET` | (empty) | OAuth2 client secret (required for `oauth2_client_credentials`) |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_SCOPE` | (empty) | OAuth2 scope parameter (optional, e.g. `api://app-id/.default` for Entra) |

### OAuth2 Client Credentials Authentication

When the gate endpoint is protected by an OAuth2 identity provider (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, or Cognito), set `REGISTRATION_GATE_AUTH_TYPE=oauth2_client_credentials` and configure the token endpoint credentials. The registry acquires a fresh access token via the [OAuth2 Client Credentials flow (RFC 6749 Section 4.4)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) before each gate call.

**How it works:**

1. Before calling the gate endpoint, the registry POSTs to the configured token URL with `grant_type=client_credentials`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, and optionally `scope`
2. If the token endpoint returns a valid `access_token`, the registry sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to the gate
3. If token acquisition fails (timeout, invalid credentials, network error), the registration is **blocked immediately** (fail-closed). No gate call is attempted.

**OAuth2 Configuration Parameters:**

| Variable | Default | Required | Description |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL` | (empty) | Yes | OAuth2 token endpoint URL. This is the IdP endpoint that issues access tokens via the client credentials grant. Example (Entra): `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token` |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID` | (empty) | Yes | OAuth2 client ID (also called "application ID" in Entra). The service principal identity used to authenticate with the token endpoint. |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET` | (empty) | Yes | OAuth2 client secret. The credential paired with the client ID. This value is sensitive and is masked on the System Config page. Never logged. |
| `REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_SCOPE` | (empty) | No | OAuth2 scope or resource parameter sent in the token request. Some IdPs require this (e.g., Entra requires `api://{app-id}/.default`), others use it optionally or not at all. Leave empty if your IdP does not require a scope for client credentials grants. |

All four parameters are available in Docker (`.env` / `docker-compose.yml`), Terraform/ECS (`variables.tf` / `ecs-services.tf`), Helm/EKS (`values.yaml` / `secret.yaml`), and the System Config page in the UI.

**Example configuration (Entra ID):**

```bash
REGISTRATION_GATE_ENABLED=true
REGISTRATION_GATE_URL=https://gate.example.com/check
REGISTRATION_GATE_AUTH_TYPE=oauth2_client_credentials
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/oauth2/v2.0/token
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_SCOPE=api://your-app-id/.default
```

**Example configuration (Okta):**

```bash
REGISTRATION_GATE_AUTH_TYPE=oauth2_client_credentials
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL=https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_SCOPE=api://gate
```

**Example configuration (Keycloak):**

```bash
REGISTRATION_GATE_AUTH_TYPE=oauth2_client_credentials
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL=https://keycloak.example.com/realms/mcp-gateway/protocol/openid-connect/token
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
REGISTRATION_GATE_OAUTH2_SCOPE=
```

**Startup validation:** At startup, the registry verifies that all required OAuth2 fields (`token_url`, `client_id`, `client_secret`) are set when `auth_type` is `oauth2_client_credentials`, and attempts a test token acquisition. Warnings are logged if the token URL uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, or if the test token acquisition fails.

See [issue #917](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry/issues/917) for the full design specification.

### Endpoints Covered

The gate is checked on the following operations:

| Asset Type | Operation | Endpoint |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Agent | Register | `POST /api/agents/register` |
| Agent | Update | `PUT /api/agents/{path}` |
| Server | Register | `POST /servers/register`, `POST /internal/register`, `POST /api/servers/register` |
| Server | Update | `POST /edit/{path}` |
| Skill | Register | `POST /api/skills` |
| Skill | Update | `PUT /api/skills/{path}` |

### Example: Simple Gate Endpoint

A minimal Python gate endpoint that approves all registrations:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/gate")
async def gate(request: Request):
    body = await request.json()
    # Implement your approval logic here
    return {"status": "allowed"}
```

To deny a registration, return HTTP 403 with an error message:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/gate")
async def gate(request: Request):
    body = await request.json()
    name = body.get("registration_payload", {}).get("name", "")
    if not name.startswith("prod-"):
        return JSONResponse(
            status_code=403,
            content={"error": "All production assets must start with 'prod-'"},
        )
    return {"status": "allowed"}
```

See [issue #809](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry/issues/809) for the full design specification.
