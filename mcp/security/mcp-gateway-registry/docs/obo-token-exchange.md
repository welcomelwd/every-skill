# Same-IdP OBO Token Exchange (`obo_exchange` egress)

*Status: Feature documentation. Per-server opt-in via `egress_auth_mode=obo_exchange`.*

`obo_exchange` is an egress auth mode in which the gateway, instead of injecting a
vaulted third-party token (see [Per-User Egress Credential Vault](egress-credential-vault.md)),
performs an **On-Behalf-Of token exchange at the same IdP** as the gateway. It
takes the user's ingress JWT and re-audiences it (Entra `jwt-bearer` / Keycloak
RFC 8693) to an **internal** MCP server's app, preserving the user's identity, and
forwards that exchanged token to the MCP server.

What the gateway does — the complete `obo_exchange` behavior — is a single
exchange: user's ingress JWT in, a token audienced to the MCP server's app out.
Using the gateway's OWN IdP client credentials it re-audiences the token,
preserving the user's `sub`/`oid`, strips the user's gateway credentials, injects
the exchanged token, and forwards the request. The MCP server receives an
IdP-signed JWT that authenticates the calling user to it.

Because the forwarded token is a valid IdP-signed JWT, the MCP server **may
optionally** exchange it again at the same IdP for a downstream-resource token
(e.g. Microsoft Graph) and call that resource as the user — a further OBO exchange
the server author chooses to implement. That second exchange is entirely the MCP
server's own code and is out of scope for the gateway; `obo_exchange` neither
performs nor requires it. Some servers simply validate the token and act on it
directly.

This is the same-IdP, stateless sibling of the 3LO vault: no per-user consent, no
token storage, no provider table — the gateway mints a fresh exchanged token per
request. It is for **internal** MCP servers that live in the same tenant/realm as
the gateway.

This document doubles as a **verification runbook**: §2–§3 walk through deploying
a barebones `obo-echo` server (which, as an example, exchanges the token again
against Graph) and exercising the flow against the `mcp-entra` Helm release.

## Concepts and terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **OBO (on-behalf-of)** | An IdP token exchange that re-audiences a token to another app while preserving the user's delegated identity, not a shared bot. |
| **`obo_exchange` (the gateway's exchange)** | The complete gateway behavior: ingress JWT -> token audienced to the internal MCP server's app, forwarded to the server. This is all `obo_exchange` does. |
| **Downstream exchange (optional, MCP-server side)** | The MCP server's own, optional further exchange of the token it receives for a downstream-resource token (e.g. Graph). Server-author's code, not the gateway's; out of scope here. |
| **`egress_auth_mode=obo_exchange`** | Per-server flag selecting this mode instead of `none` / `oauth_user` (3LO vault). |
| **`target_audience`** | The internal MCP server's IdP audience (Entra App ID URI / Keycloak client id) the gateway requests in the exchange. |
| **Ingress token** | The user's JWT presented to the gateway (`X-Authorization`), used as the OBO `assertion`/`subject_token`. Must be a bearer JWT, not a session cookie. |
| **Per-server resource (RFC 8707)** | `https://<gateway>/<server>/mcp` — the resource an MCP client requests at login; must be a registered Entra App ID URI (see [resource constraint](#resource-constraint)). |
| **Egress injection seam** | The shared `mcp_proxy` code (gate -> strip gateway creds -> inject `Authorization`) reused by both `oauth_user` and `obo_exchange`. |

Deployment facts for the verification runbook (`mcp-entra` release):
- Registry API **and** MCP proxy share ONE host
  `https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com`; a server's MCP proxy lives at
  `https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com/<server>/mcp` (a per-server
  nginx location that exists only after the server is registered, §3b).
- Namespace `mcp-entra`; the echo upstream is in-cluster at
  `http://obo-echo.mcp-entra.svc.cluster.local:8000/mcp`.
- `target_audience` MUST be an internal MCP server's own IdP audience and is
  validated at registration. It must differ from the gateway's own
  `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` / App ID URI (same-app OBO is rejected), and must be an
  `api://` App ID URI — including the auto-generated `api://<app-guid>` form
  (e.g. `api://00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`) — or a bare non-GUID
  client-id. It must not be an `https://` host URL or a bare GUID, which is how a
  shared first-party resource (Microsoft Graph, ARM, Key Vault) is directly
  addressable. The `api://<guid>` form is accepted without an allowlist entry
  because an `api://` string names a custom (tenant-local) app registration, so
  the normal case needs no configuration.

  Every `egress_oauth.scope` must also be audience-scoped to `target_audience`
  (e.g. `api://<app>/.default`); a scope for a different resource is rejected,
  since the exchange engine sends scopes verbatim. This prevents a confused
  deputy where an over-permitted gateway app mints a broad delegated token for a
  first-party API that is then forwarded to the server's upstream.

- **Always-on first-party floor.** Microsoft Graph, Azure AD Graph, Azure
  Resource Manager, and Azure Key Vault (matched by app-id GUID in bare or
  `api://` form, and by canonical `https://` host including sovereign clouds) are
  rejected as an obo target unconditionally. `EGRESS_OBO_ALLOWED_AUDIENCES` cannot
  re-enable them; there is no supported configuration that OBO-exchanges into
  these resources.

- **`EGRESS_OBO_ALLOWED_AUDIENCES`** (optional operator allowlist). When set, a
  target must be listed (authoritative for everything not covered by the
  always-on floor above). Use it to permit an internal audience that is a bare
  GUID, or to restrict obo targets to an explicit, audited set.

- **Residual, by design.** A Microsoft first-party resource outside the floor set
  (e.g. Azure Storage, Azure SQL) expressed as `api://<its-app-guid>` passes the
  shape rule. Reaching it additionally requires (a) an administrator to register
  the obo server for that target and (b) the gateway app to already hold delegated
  permissions on that resource — neither of which exists by default. To eliminate
  the residual entirely, set `EGRESS_OBO_ALLOWED_AUDIENCES` to an explicit list.

---

## Architecture

The gateway performs its exchange inline at the `mcp_proxy` hop, reusing the egress
injection seam. Unlike the 3LO vault, there is **no secret store and no consent
facade** — the exchange is stateless and uses the gateway's own IdP credentials.

Steps 1–4 are the gateway's `obo_exchange`; steps 5–6 are the example echo
server's own optional downstream exchange (dashed), not something the gateway
performs or requires.

---

## Runtime sequence

A warm call — no consent, no vault, no storage. The gateway exchanges the ingress
token per request and forwards the result.

    O-->>P: exchanged token
    P->>P: strip Authorization/X-Authorization/Cookie/X-Internal-Token
    P->>M: forward with Authorization: Bearer <exchanged token>
    Note over M,D: OPTIONAL server-side exchange (not the gateway, server-author's choice)
    M->>M: validate aud == this server's app
    M->>I: grant_type=jwt-bearer, assertion=<exchanged token>,<br/>client_id/secret=MCP server app, scope=Graph
    I-->>M: downstream token (aud=Graph, sub still the user)

    D-->>M: 200 (the user's profile)
    M-->>P: JSON-RPC result
    P-->>C: MCP response
```

Key points:

- **Stateless, per-request.** The exchanged token embeds the user's `sub`; it is
  minted fresh each request and never cached/reused across users.
- **The user's gateway credentials never reach the MCP server.** The seam strips
  `Authorization`/`X-Authorization`/`Cookie`/`X-Internal-Token` before injecting
  the exchanged token.
- **The forwarded token can be exchanged again.** Because it is an IdP-signed JWT
  audienced to the MCP server's app, the server MAY exchange it again for a
  downstream resource if its author chooses to — but it does not have to; many
  servers just validate and use it. A raw 3LO provider token or the internal HS256
  proxy token could not be exchanged this way.
- **Non-interactive.** Unlike `oauth_user`, there is no consent elicitation; a
  failure is terminal (the agent cannot open a browser mid tool-call).

---

## How `obo_exchange` differs from the 3LO vault

Both modes share the `mcp_proxy` egress injection seam; they differ only in how
the forwarded token is **sourced**.

| Aspect | `oauth_user` (3LO vault) | `obo_exchange` (this doc) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Token source | Per-user vaulted third-party token | IdP token exchange, minted per request |
| IdP relationship | Third-party provider (GitHub/Google/...) | SAME IdP as the gateway |
| User interaction | One-time browser consent per `(provider, server)` | None (ingress token is the exchange subject) |
| Storage | Secret store (OpenBao / Secrets Manager) + refresh | Stateless — nothing stored |
| Forwarded token | Provider resource token (opaque, not re-exchangeable) | IdP JWT re-audienced to the MCP server (the server may optionally exchange it again) |
| Registration | `provider`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, scopes | `target_audience` (+ audience scopes) |
| Credentials used | Per-server operator-supplied OAuth app | The gateway's OWN IdP client credentials |
| Target servers | External SaaS | Internal MCP servers in the same tenant/realm |

---

## Registration contract

An `obo_exchange` server entry needs only:

| Field | Role |
|-------|------|
| `egress_auth_mode = "obo_exchange"` | Selects the exchange path at the seam. |
| `egress_oauth.target_audience` | The internal MCP server's IdP audience (Entra App ID URI / Keycloak client id). The `aud` the gateway requests in the exchange; the value the MCP server validates (and, if it exchanges again, chains from). **Required; must differ from the gateway's own client id.** |
| `egress_oauth.scopes` | Audience-scoped scopes for the exchange (e.g. `["api://<mcp-app>/.default"]`). Optional; defaults to `<target_audience>/.default` for Entra. |

No `provider` / `client_id` / `client_secret` (those are 3LO-only). The MCP server
validates the token it receives against two facts the gateway guarantees: the
**expected `aud`** (its own app, registered as `target_audience`) and the **shared
issuer** (the same IdP — already known). If it exchanges the token again for a
downstream resource, it does so against those same facts.

---

## The RFC 8707 resource / Entra App ID URI constraint

The hardest part of wiring this on Entra with a real MCP client is making three
independent rules agree on ONE resource string:

1. **RFC 9728 §3.3 (client):** an MCP client only accepts a Protected Resource
   Metadata (PRM) `resource` equal to the connection URL it is accessing (or that
   URL's origin). A made-up shared path is rejected.
2. **RFC 8707 (client):** a bare-origin resource is canonicalized with a trailing
   `/` on the wire — which Entra App ID URIs cannot match (Entra forbids a
   trailing slash in `identifierUris`).
3. **Entra:** the `resource` the client sends must equal a registered Application
   ID URI **exactly**, and the requested scope must live under that URI.

The only value satisfying all three is the **per-server connection URL**
`https://<gateway>/<server>/mcp`. The gateway makes this work automatically:

- The 401 on `/<server>/mcp` advertises a **per-server** `WWW-Authenticate:
  resource_metadata=.../.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/<server>/mcp` (nginx
  per-location override). This override fires for any server whose ingress login
  needs a path-qualified Entra App ID URI: every `obo_exchange` server, plus
  `oauth_user` (3LO) servers **when the gateway's IdP is Entra**. Lenient IdPs
  (Keycloak/Cognito) keep using the gateway-wide root PRM for 3LO.
- That per-server PRM advertises `resource = https://<gateway>/<server>/mcp` and
  scope `.../user_impersonation`, derived dynamically from the registry entry.
- auth-server validates that per-server `aud` (built from the **public** gateway
  URL).

The single manual consequence: each obo server's per-server URL must be in the
gateway app's `identifierUris` array (see [§1f](#1f-add-each-obo-servers-per-server-url-to-the-gateway-apps-identifieruris)).
`GET /api/egress/obo-identifier-uris` returns the exact list. This is the
registry-dynamic / Entra-manual compromise; clients on lenient IdPs
(Keycloak/Cognito) do not hit constraints 2–3.

---

## Environment variables

`obo_exchange` adds **no required env vars** — it is configured per-server in the
registry and uses the gateway's existing IdP credentials. Relevant existing vars:

| Variable | Service | Role for `obo_exchange` |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|
| `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` / `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET` / `ENTRA_TENANT_ID` | auth-server | The gateway's OWN IdP app — used as the calling client in the exchange. Already set for ingress auth. |
| `AUTH_SERVER_EXTERNAL_URL` | auth-server | Public gateway URL; auth-server builds the per-server audience to validate from it (NOT the internal `REGISTRY_URL`). |
| `REGISTRY_URL` | registry | Public gateway URL; the per-server PRM `resource` is built from it. |
| `IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `IDE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT` | registry | Pre-registered public client advertised to IDEs that consume the Connect config (Cursor). Claude Code passes these as CLI flags instead. |
| `MCP_ADVERTISED_SCOPES` | registry | Affects only the gateway-wide root PRM (non-obo discovery). Leave at the chart default; obo uses the per-server PRM. |
| `SSRF_ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `SSRF_ALLOWED_CIDRS` | registry | **Required for an in-cluster MCP server.** The registry validates each server's `proxy_pass_url` through the SSRF guard, which blocks private/cluster IPs; an internal server (private ClusterIP) is otherwise marked unhealthy and its nginx location is commented out, so requests return `405`. List the server's host (`SSRF_ALLOWED_HOSTS=obo-echo.<ns>.svc.cluster.local`) or the cluster service CIDR (`SSRF_ALLOWED_CIDRS=172.20.0.0/16`, the EKS default). Chart values: `registry.app.ssrfAllowedHosts` / `registry.app.ssrfAllowedCidrs`. |

## 1. Entra app registration

Two apps, same tenant as the gateway. The gateway app already exists (it's the
deploy's `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`); you create the echo server's app and wire two
permission edges -- one per hop.

> **PREREQUISITE -- verify the gateway's domain in the tenant.** The MCP-client
> login path (3d-alt) needs the gateway's per-server URLs
> (`https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com/<server>/mcp`) registered as
> Application ID URIs (1f). Entra only accepts an `https://` (custom-scheme)
> identifier URI on a **tenant-verified domain** -- otherwise it rejects the URI
> with *"Values of IdentifierUris property must use a verified domain of the
> organization or its subdomain."* So before 1f:
> 1. Entra ID -> **Custom domain names** -> **Add custom domain** -> enter the
>    domain (`example.com`, or the specific subdomain). Needs Global Admin or
>    Domain Name Admin.
> 2. Add the **TXT record** Entra shows (`MS=msXXXXXXXX`) at your DNS provider
>    (e.g. Route 53 for `example.com`), then click **Verify**.
> Verifying the apex (`example.com`) covers subdomains like
> `mcpregistry.agents.example.com`. This is a one-time tenant-wide step;
> the CLI token path (3a) does NOT need it (it mints against any scope without an
> `https://` App ID URI), only the interactive MCP-client path does.

### 1a. Create the echo server's app (the hop-1 target)

1. Entra ID -> App registrations -> New: name `obo-echo-mcp-server`, single tenant.
2. **Expose an API** (its *Application ID URI* becomes `target_audience`):
   - *Expose an API* -> *Add* Application ID URI. Accept `api://<client-id>` or
     set `api://obo-echo-mcp-server`.
   - *Add a scope* with these fields:

     | Field | Value |
     |-------|-------|
     | Scope name | `access_as_user` |
     | (full scope, auto-filled) | `api://<echo-client-id>/access_as_user` |
     | Who can consent? | **Admins and users** |
     | Admin consent display name | `Access obo-echo as the user` |
     | Admin consent description | `Allows the gateway to call the obo-echo MCP server on behalf of the signed-in user.` |
     | User consent display name | `Access obo-echo on your behalf` |
     | User consent description | `Allows the gateway to call the obo-echo MCP server on your behalf.` |
     | State | **Enabled** |

   - **Record the App ID URI** -> used as `target_audience` (registry) and
     `MCP_APP_AUDIENCE` (echo env).
3. **Certificates & secrets** -> *New client secret*. **Record the value** ->
   `MCP_CLIENT_SECRET`. The app's client id -> `MCP_CLIENT_ID`. (Needed for hop 2.)

### 1a-bis. Expose a `user_impersonation` scope on the GATEWAY app

**Why:** the ingress token the agent presents (`X-Authorization`) MUST be
audienced to the gateway app, or Entra rejects the OBO assertion with
`AADSTS50013: Assertion failed signature validation`. The user token is minted
against a scope the gateway app *exposes*; if none exists you get
`AADSTS65005: ... scope 'user_impersonation' that doesn't exist`. So the gateway
app must expose a delegated scope. Do this once on the GATEWAY app (the deploy's
`ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, e.g. `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`).

Steps (Azure Portal -> Entra ID -> App registrations -> the gateway app):

1. Open **Expose an API**.
2. If **Application ID URI** is not set, click **Add** at the top and **Save**
   (accept the default `api://<gateway-client-id>`). If already set, note it.
3. Click **+ Add a scope** and enter:

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | Scope name | `user_impersonation` |
   | (full scope, auto-filled) | `api://<gateway-client-id>/user_impersonation` |
   | Who can consent? | **Admins and users** |
   | Admin consent display name | `Access the MCP gateway as the user` |
   | Admin consent description | `Allows the app to access the MCP gateway on behalf of the signed-in user.` |
   | User consent display name | `Access the MCP gateway on your behalf` |
   | User consent description | `Allows the app to access the MCP gateway on your behalf.` |
   | State | **Enabled** |

4. Click **Add scope**.

`cli/get_user_token.py` defaults to requesting
`api://<ENTRA_CLIENT_ID>/user_impersonation`, so once this scope exists and you
mint with `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` = the GATEWAY app (3a), the token's `aud` == the
gateway client id -- exactly what the OBO assertion requires.

> If the gateway app already exposes a different scope and you don't want to add
> one, skip this and pass `--scope "api://<gateway-client-id>/<existing-scope>
> openid profile email"` to `get_user_token.py` in 3a instead.

### 1b. Hop-1 edge: gateway app -> echo API

So Entra will issue the gateway a token audienced to the echo server.

- Gateway app -> *API permissions* -> *Add a permission* -> select the echo API
  -> *Delegated* -> `access_as_user` -> Add.
  - The echo API only shows under *My APIs* if you OWN it. If it's missing there,
    use the **APIs my organization uses** tab and search by name
    (`obo-echo-mcp-server`) or client id (`11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`). Alternatively add
    yourself as an Owner of the echo app, then it appears under *My APIs*.
  - If it's in neither tab, the scope didn't save -- recheck *Expose an API*.
- **Grant admin consent** for the tenant.

### 1c. Hop-2 edge: echo app -> Microsoft Graph

So the echo server can exchange its token for a Graph token on the user's behalf.

- Echo app (`obo-echo-mcp-server`) -> *API permissions* -> *Add* ->
  *Microsoft Graph* -> *Delegated permissions* -> `User.Read` -> Add.
- **Grant admin consent** for the tenant. (`User.Read` is usually consentable by
  users too, but admin consent avoids an interactive prompt during the silent
  hop-2 exchange.)

> Delegated (not application) permissions on Graph are required: `jwt-bearer` OBO
> mints delegated tokens. An application-permission-only app fails hop 2.

### 1d. The ingress token's audience (per-server resource)

This is the crux. The ingress token's `aud` MUST equal the resource Entra was
asked for, which (for the MCP-client flow) is the PER-SERVER resource
`https://<gw>/<server>/mcp` -- see 3d-alt for the full chain. The gateway makes
this automatic; the only requirements are:

1. **The gateway app exposes a `user_impersonation` scope** (1a-bis). It is shared
   across all obo servers via its stable permission id.
2. **Each obo server's per-server URL is in the gateway app's `identifierUris`**
   (the manual Entra step; see 3d-alt and `GET /api/egress/obo-identifier-uris`).

No `MCP_ADVERTISED_SCOPES` tuning is needed for obo: the per-server PRM advertises
the correct per-server `resource` + scope dynamically from the registry entry.
(`MCP_ADVERTISED_SCOPES` only affects the gateway-wide root PRM used by non-obo
discovery; leave it at the chart default `openid profile email offline_access`.)

> For the CLI token path (3a) the `aud` is whatever resource you mint against via
> `--scope`; for the MCP-client path it is the per-server resource the client
> derives from its connection URL. Both are validated by auth_server's dynamic
> per-server audience check (`_obo_extra_audiences`, built from the public
> gateway URL).

### 1e. An OAuth client app for the MCP client (Claude)

Entra has **no Dynamic Client Registration**, so the MCP client cannot
self-register -- it needs a pre-provisioned OAuth client_id to run PKCE against,
advertised by the gateway via `IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`. Two ways to provide it:

#### Option A -- separate public client app (keeps the gateway app confidential)

Recommended when you do NOT want public-client flows enabled on the production
gateway app. The public-flow toggle lives on a dedicated client instead.

1. App registrations -> New -> name `mcp-ide-client`, single tenant.
2. **Authentication** -> *Add a platform* -> *Mobile and desktop applications* ->
   add the loopback redirect URI **`http://localhost:8080/callback`**.
   - You choose the port (8080 here); Entra matches `redirect_uri` literally, so
     it must equal what the client uses. The path is `/callback` (hardcoded by
     Claude Code). Pick a free high port and use it consistently below.
3. **Authentication** -> *Advanced settings* -> **Allow public client flows = Yes**
   (on THIS app, not the gateway).
4. **API permissions** -> *Add* -> the gateway API (`00000000-...`) -> *Delegated*
   -> `user_impersonation` -> Add -> **Grant admin consent**.
5. Record this app's **client id** -> `IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`.

Wire it into the gateway:
```bash
kubectl set env deploy/registry -n mcp-entra -c registry \
  IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<mcp-ide-client client id>
kubectl rollout status deploy/registry -n mcp-entra
```

#### Option B -- reuse the gateway app as the IDE client (one app, but loosens it)

Simpler (no second app), but REQUIRES enabling public-client flows on the
production gateway app `00000000-...`. Only choose this if that is acceptable for
your environment.

1. Gateway app `00000000-...` -> **Authentication** -> *Add a platform* ->
   *Mobile and desktop applications* -> add the loopback redirect URIs.
2. **Authentication** -> *Advanced settings* -> **Allow public client flows = Yes**.
   (The gateway app keeps its client secret for auth_server's server-side use;
   this only additionally permits the interactive public flow.)
3. The gateway already exposes `user_impersonation` and the user is in the tenant,
   so no extra permission grant is needed -- it is requesting its own API.
4. Wire its own id as the IDE client:
```bash
kubectl set env deploy/registry -n mcp-entra -c registry \
  IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
kubectl rollout status deploy/registry -n mcp-entra
```

**Trade-off:** Option A isolates the public-flow risk to a throwaway dev app and
keeps the gateway app purely confidential (production-correct). Option B avoids a
second app but enables public-client flows on the gateway app itself.

### 1f. Add each obo server's per-server URL to the gateway app's `identifierUris`

**Required for the MCP-client login path (3d-alt), one entry per obo server.**
An MCP client sends an RFC 8707 `resource` equal to its connection URL
(`https://<gw>/<server>/mcp`), and Entra requires that `resource` to be a
registered Application ID URI on the gateway app, or it rejects the auth request
with `AADSTS9010010`. So every obo server's per-server URL must be in the gateway
app's `identifierUris` array.

- `identifierUris` is an **array** (the *Expose an API* blade shows only one;
  edit the array via **App registration -> Manifest**). Add one line per obo
  server; existing entries keep working -- you append, never replace.
- The exact values to register are produced by the registry:
  ```bash
  # admin-authenticated; returns {"identifier_uris": [...], "count": N}
  curl -ksS https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com/api/egress/obo-identifier-uris \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" | jq
  ```
- For the echo server the entry is
  `https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com/obo-echo/mcp`. Example manifest:
  ```json
  "identifierUris": [
      "https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com",
      "https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com/obo-echo/mcp"
  ]
  ```
- The shared `user_impersonation` scope (1a-bis) resolves under each of these
  URIs via its stable permission id -- no per-server scope or re-consent needed.
- **Do this AFTER registering the server (3b)** so its path exists, and BEFORE
  the client connects (3d-alt). The registry side is automatic (per-server PRM +
  audience validation); this array is the one manual Entra step per obo server.

> Scaling note: Entra caps `identifierUris` (historically ~50 per app). Fine for
> tens of obo servers; a deployment with hundreds would need the token-broker
> approach (out of scope here).

Summary of what you recorded:
| Value | Used as | Where |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Echo App ID URI (`api://obo-echo-mcp-server`) | `target_audience` / `MCP_APP_AUDIENCE` | registry config + echo env |
| Echo app client id | `MCP_CLIENT_ID` | echo Secret (hop 2) |
| Echo app client secret | `MCP_CLIENT_SECRET` | echo Secret (hop 2) |
| Tenant id | `IDP_TOKEN_URL` tenant segment | echo env (hop 2) |
| Per-server URL (`https://<gw>/obo-echo/mcp`) | gateway app `identifierUris` entry | Entra (1f), per obo server |

---

## 2. Deploy the echo server (no image build)

Files in this dir: `obo_echo_server.py`, `obo-echo-k8s.yaml`.

```bash
cd .scratchpad/obo-verify
NS=mcp-entra

# 1. server source as a ConfigMap (re-run to update the code).
kubectl create configmap obo-echo-src \
  --from-file=obo_echo_server.py -n $NS \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# 2. hop-2 credentials as a Secret (echo app from step 1a).
kubectl create secret generic obo-echo-hop2 -n $NS \
  --from-literal=MCP_CLIENT_ID='<echo app client id>' \
  --from-literal=MCP_CLIENT_SECRET='<echo app client secret>' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

# 3. edit obo-echo-k8s.yaml env:
#      MCP_APP_AUDIENCE -> your App ID URI
#      IDP_TOKEN_URL    -> replace REPLACE_TENANT_ID
kubectl apply -f obo-echo-k8s.yaml
kubectl rollout status deploy/obo-echo -n $NS   # first start is slow (pip install)
```

To update the server code later: re-run the `create configmap ... | apply` and
`kubectl rollout restart deploy/obo-echo -n $NS`.

---

## 3. Registry setup + exercise

### 3a. Get a USER token (the OBO subject)

`obo_exchange` requires a delegated **user** JWT on the ingress (an M2M
`client_credentials` token is not chainable and is rejected). Device-code flow:

```bash
export ENTRA_TENANT_ID=<tenant>
export ENTRA_CLIENT_ID=<gateway app client id>    # same app the gateway uses
export ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET=<gateway app secret>   # if confidential
# Use --output (NOT --stdout > file): this is a device-code flow that PRINTS a
# verification URL + code to stdout and blocks while polling. With `--stdout >
# file` that prompt is redirected into the file and the run looks "hung". With
# --output, the prompt shows in the terminal and only the token is written.
uv run python cli/get_user_token.py --output /tmp/user.jwt
# -> open the printed URL, enter the code, sign in as the test user
JWT=$(cat /tmp/user.jwt)
```

### 3b. Register the echo server

```bash
REG=https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com
curl -sk -X POST "$REG/api/servers/register" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -F "name=OBO Echo" \
  -F "description=OBO hop-1+hop-2 verification server" \
  -F "path=/obo-echo" \
  -F "proxy_pass_url=http://obo-echo.mcp-entra.svc.cluster.local:8000/mcp" \
  -F "transport=streamable-http"
```

### 3c. Configure obo_exchange egress (admin)

`target_audience` = the echo App ID URI from 1a. Must differ from the gateway's
own `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`.

**UI:** edit the server in the Dashboard -> *Egress Auth* -> Mode
**OBO exchange (same IdP)** -> enter the Target Audience -> Save.

**API (equivalent):**

```bash
curl -sk -X POST "$REG/api/servers/obo-echo/egress-auth" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"egress_auth_mode":"obo_exchange","target_audience":"api://obo-echo-mcp-server","scopes":[]}'
# 200 with egress_auth_mode=obo_exchange + target_audience echoed.
# 400 "must differ from the gateway's own IdP client id" => you used the gateway
#     app id; use the echo server's App ID URI.

curl -sk "$REG/api/servers/obo-echo/egress-auth" -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" | jq
```

### 3d. Exercise the tool through the gateway

```bash
# Same host as the registry API; the /obo-echo/ location exists only after 3b.
GW=https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com
curl -ksS -i -X POST "$GW/obo-echo/mcp" \
  -H "X-Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"whoami","arguments":{}}}'
```

### 3d-alt. Exercise via an MCP client (Claude Code)

> **WORKING on Entra end-to-end (2026-06-25)** via the per-server PRM. Claude Code
> discovers OAuth, logs in via browser PKCE, gets a gateway-audienced token, and
> the gateway performs its OBO exchange -> the echo server (optionally) exchanges
> again. No CLI token.
>
> **How it works (the per-server resource chain).** The hard part was making three
> independent constraints agree on ONE resource string:
>   - RFC 9728 §3.3: the client only accepts a PRM `resource` equal to the
>     connection URL it is accessing (a made-up shared path is rejected).
>   - RFC 8707: a bare-origin resource gets a trailing `/` on the wire, which
>     Entra App ID URIs cannot match (Entra forbids a trailing slash).
>   - Entra: the `resource` the client sends must equal a registered App ID URI
>     exactly, and the requested scope must live under that URI.
>   The only value satisfying all three is the **per-server connection URL**
>   (`https://gw/<server>/mcp`). The gateway now advertises exactly that:
>     1. The 401 on `/<server>/mcp` emits a PER-SERVER
>        `WWW-Authenticate: resource_metadata=<gw>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/<server>/mcp`
>        (nginx per-location `set $mcp_resource_metadata`; every obo server, and
>        `oauth_user` servers too when the gateway IdP is Entra).
>     2. That per-server PRM advertises `resource = <gw>/<server>/mcp` and
>        `scope = <gw>/<server>/mcp/user_impersonation` (dynamic, from the registry).
>     3. Claude sends `resource=<gw>/<server>/mcp` verbatim (has a path -> no
>        trailing-slash) + that scope -> Entra matches the App ID URI -> token
>        `aud = <gw>/<server>/mcp`.
>     4. auth_server validates that per-server `aud` (built from the PUBLIC
>        gateway URL, `_obo_extra_audiences`) -> gateway OBO exchange -> the echo
>        server's optional downstream exchange.
>
> **Operator's only manual step: keep Entra's `identifierUris` in sync.** Each obo
> server's per-server URL (`https://gw/<server>/mcp`) must be one of the gateway
> app's `identifierUris` (it is an array -- add one line per obo server, edit via
> App registration -> Manifest). `GET /api/egress/obo-identifier-uris` returns the
> exact list the registry expects. The `user_impersonation` scope is shared (its
> stable permission id), so no per-server scope or re-consent is needed.

Claude Code (Entra has no DCR, so pass the pre-registered public client id +
the fixed callback port that matches the redirect URI from 1e; public client ->
NO `--client-secret`):
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http \
  --client-id <mcp-ide-client client id> \
  --callback-port 8080 \
  obo-echo https://mcpregistry.agents.exmaple.com/obo-echo/mcp
# Then run /mcp inside Claude Code to trigger the browser PKCE login. After
# consent Claude holds a gateway-audienced token and calls through the gateway
# (which performs OBO hop 1). Ask it to run the server's `whoami` tool.
```

Notes:
- Claude Code takes `--client-id`/`--callback-port` on the CLI (it does NOT read
  the gateway's `IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`IDE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT`; those are for
  IDEs like Cursor that consume the gateway Connect config). The redirect URI
  `http://localhost:8080/callback` must be registered on the client app (1e).
- Without `--client-id` Claude Code attempts Dynamic Client Registration and
  fails on Entra with "Incompatible auth server: does not support dynamic client
  registration."

What to confirm: the `whoami` tool result shows the same `hop1`/`hop2` success
fields as below. The only difference from 3d is WHERE the ingress token came from
(the client's PKCE login vs a hand-minted `$JWT`); the gateway behavior is
identical. If you get `AADSTS9010010`, the client's `resource` did not match an
Entra App ID URI -- confirm the per-server URL (`https://<gw>/<server>/mcp`) is in
the gateway app's `identifierUris` (3d-alt) and the 401 advertises the per-server
`resource_metadata` (`curl -i .../<server>/mcp` -> check the WWW-Authenticate).

### What success looks like

The `whoami` result has `hop1` and `hop2`:

**hop1** (the gateway re-audienced correctly):
- `aud` == `target_audience` (`api://obo-echo-mcp-server`) — not the gateway.
- `aud_matches: true`.
- `sub` / `preferred_username` == the USER who minted the ingress token.
- `appid` == the gateway's Entra client id (the calling app on hop 1).

**hop2** (the echo server chained it):
- `exchanged: true`.
- `downstream_oid_matches_hop1: true` — the user's identity survived hop 2.
  (Compare `oid`, NOT `sub`: Entra `sub` is pairwise/audience-scoped and
  legitimately differs between the hop-1 and hop-2 tokens for the same user;
  `oid` is the stable cross-resource user id.)
- `downstream_aud` == `https://graph.microsoft.com` (or `00000003-0000-0000-...`).
- `downstream_call.userPrincipalName` == the same user — the chained Graph token
  actually worked against `GET /me`.

> **VERIFIED end-to-end on the mcp-entra deployment (2026-06-25).** A device-code
> user token (aud=`https://mcpregistry.agents.example.com`, minted via the
> public `mcp-ide-client` app to avoid the confidential-client device-code block)
> drove `whoami` through the gateway: hop1 `aud_matches: true` (re-audienced to
> `api://11111111-...`, appid=gateway), hop2 `exchanged: true` calling Graph
> `/me` as the same user (oid matched). The OBO feature works. Token capture used
> the CLI device-code path; the MCP-client (Claude) login path remains the
> documented Entra `resource`-binding gap (3d-alt), independent of OBO.

### Failure triage

| Symptom | Meaning | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `405 Method Not Allowed` on `POST /<server>/mcp` (before any OBO error) | The internal server was marked unhealthy and its nginx location commented out, so the POST hit a catch-all. Registry logs show `Health check blocked by SSRF guard ... resolves to blocked/private IP`. | Allowlist the server's private address for the SSRF guard: set `SSRF_ALLOWED_CIDRS` (cluster service CIDR) or `SSRF_ALLOWED_HOSTS` on the registry (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)). |
| JSON-RPC `obo_exchange_failed`, `invalid_grant` | the gateway app is not granted the echo API / user lacks scope / ingress JWT expired | step 1b consent; re-mint user token (3a) |
| `obo_exchange_failed`, `interaction_required` | HOP 1: echo app not admin-consented | grant admin consent (1b) |
| `obo_exchange_failed`, `AADSTS50013 ... signature validation` | HOP 1: the ingress token's `aud` is NOT the gateway app (it's Graph/echo/other) | the token must be minted against the gateway's `user_impersonation` scope -- check 1d (advertised scope) and that the client requested it |
| `obo_exchange_failed`, "requires a bearer JWT" | session cookie / no `X-Authorization` / M2M token | use a delegated USER bearer token (MCP-client PKCE login, 3d-alt) in `X-Authorization` |
| MCP client never prompts for login / can't register | no `IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` advertised, and Entra has no DCR | set `IDE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (step 1e, Option A or B) |
| `AADSTS65005 ... scope ... doesn't exist` when minting | gateway app does not expose `user_impersonation` | step 1a-bis |
| `AADSTS7000218 ... client_assertion or client_secret` (CLI device-code) | gateway app is confidential; device-code needs the secret or public flows | pass `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET` to the patched CLI, OR use the MCP-client path (3d-alt) instead |
| 400 at 3c "must differ from the gateway's own" | `target_audience` == gateway client id | use the echo App ID URI |
| hop1 ok but `hop2.error` `invalid_grant`/`AADSTS65001` | HOP 2: echo app lacks Graph `User.Read` delegated consent | step 1c consent |
| hop1 `aud` == gateway app id (not target) | hop-1 exchange did not run | confirm 3c returned `obo_exchange`; check auth_server logs |

### Logs

## Security model

- **User identity preserved (audit).** The user's `sub`/`oid` carries through the
  gateway exchange (and any further exchange the server performs). Compare `oid`,
  not `sub`, across exchanges: Entra `sub` is pairwise/audience-scoped and
  legitimately differs per resource for the same user.
- **No credential sharing.** The user never gives their token to the MCP server.
  The seam strips the user's gateway credentials (`Authorization`,
  `X-Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-Internal-Token`, `X-User*`) before injecting the
  exchanged token, so the MCP server sees only the re-audienced OBO token.
- **Least privilege, bounded by app grants.** The gateway exchange requests
  `<target>/.default` — every delegated permission the gateway app holds on the
  MCP server's API. Tighter scoping requires listing explicit scopes rather than
  `.default`; privilege is otherwise bounded by the app-registration grants.
- **Stateless mint is a hard invariant.** The exchanged token embeds the user's
  `sub`; it is minted per request and never cached or reused across users. A
  cache-key bug would be privilege escalation; the `obo_exchange` branch shares no
  cache with the `oauth_user` vault.
- **Closed audience allowlist.** auth-server accepts a per-server `aud` only for
  the registered obo server being accessed (derived from the request path + the
  public gateway URL), never a wildcard.
- **Session-cookie / M2M callers are rejected.** OBO requires a bearer JWT as the
  exchange subject; a session-cookie or non-chainable token yields a terminal
  error, not a silent pass-through.
- **Same-app exchange rejected at registration.** `target_audience` must differ
  from the gateway's own client id (Entra rejects an OBO assertion whose `aud`
  equals the requested resource).
