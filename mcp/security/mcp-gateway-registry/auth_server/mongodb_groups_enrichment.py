"""DocumentDB/MongoDB Groups Enrichment for M2M Tokens.

This module provides functionality to enrich M2M tokens with groups from DocumentDB/MongoDB
when the IdP token has empty groups claim. This solves the authorization problem
for M2M clients across all identity providers (Keycloak, Okta, Entra).

Works with both:
- AWS DocumentDB (with IAM auth or username/password)
- MongoDB Community Edition (local or cloud)
