    Uses the OIDC ``sub`` claim, which is present in BOTH id_tokens and access

         any other method so an external issuer cannot inject a vault key.
      2. ``data.sub`` -- the raw IdP subject. Bearer paths expose the verified
         claims here; the cookie path carries the sub persisted into the session
         at login (see create_session ``subject``).
      3. ``data.subject`` -- the cookie session's persisted OIDC sub.
      4. top-level ``sub`` -- direct-token paths that surface it there.

    When no ``session_id`` is present (pure internal / M2M callers with no

# MCP tools/list filter proxy hop (Issue #1026)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# nginx sends MCP POSTs that need tools/list filtering to this endpoint
# instead of routing them directly to the upstream MCP server. The nginx
# location block is expected to set two headers before forwarding:
#
#   X-Upstream-Url:  Full URL of the upstream MCP server to forward to.
#   X-Scopes:        Space-separated user scopes (already populated by
#                    the /validate auth_request hop). The proxy trusts
#                    this header because it comes from the same nginx
#                    pass that ran auth_request and can only have been
#                    written after /validate accepted the caller.
#
# All headers from the incoming request (except hop-by-hop headers) are
# forwarded to the upstream. The upstream response headers are likewise
# forwarded back to the client (except framing/encoding headers that
# Starlette must recompute) so streamable-http session state such as the
# ``Mcp-Session-Id`` header that the upstream emits during ``initialize``
# propagates end-to-end. Without that header the MCP client cannot
# establish a session and follow-up calls fail with "Missing session ID".
# For any JSON-RPC method other than "tools/list", the upstream response
# body is returned unchanged ("uniform proxy"). For tools/list, the
# response body is buffered (up to MCP_PROXY_MAX_BODY_BYTES), filtered
# via filter_tools_list_response, and returned with an updated
# result.tools array.


_HOP_BY_HOP_HEADERS: frozenset[str] = frozenset(

# Allowlist of upstream response headers the proxy is permitted to forward
# back to the MCP client. The auth-server sits on a trust boundary in front
# of arbitrary upstream MCP servers, so the default posture is to drop
# everything and explicitly opt-in the small set of headers MCP clients
# actually act on. This prevents an upstream from dictating response-header
# policy that browsers / MCP clients honor (Set-Cookie, Strict-Transport-
# Security, Content-Security-Policy, Access-Control-Allow-*, Location,
# Server, etc.) and from overriding framing headers Starlette must set
# itself (Content-Length, Content-Encoding, Transfer-Encoding, Connection).
#
# Entries are stored lowercase; matching is case-insensitive (HTTP header
# names are case-insensitive per RFC 9110 section 5.1). Adding to this set
# is a security-relevant change -- every new entry should be reviewed for
# whether an upstream-supplied value could be abused before it lands.
#
# Why each entry is here:
#   mcp-session-id     streamable-http MCP servers emit this on initialize
#                      and clients must echo it on follow-up requests to
#                      identify the session (MCP spec, "Session
#                      management").
#   x-mcp-session-id   legacy alias some MCP servers / clients still emit;
#                      kept for compatibility with the same flow.
#   www-authenticate   required by the PRM / OAuth resource-metadata flow
#                      added in PR #1115 so 401 responses point clients at
#                      the authorization server.
#   retry-after        lets clients honor upstream 429 / 503 backoff hints
#                      rather than retry-storm the upstream.

    The protocol version echoes the client's requested version when present so
    the client does not see a version it did not ask for.
