# New Feature Design Skill

Use this skill when the user wants to design a new feature for the MCP Gateway Registry. This skill creates comprehensive design documentation that enables entry-level developers to implement the feature.

## Input Modes

This skill supports two input modes:

1. **User Description Mode** - User describes the feature they want to design
2. **GitHub Issue URL Mode** - User provides a URL to an existing GitHub issue

### Detecting Input Mode

When the user invokes this skill:
- If they provide a GitHub issue URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123`), use **GitHub Issue URL Mode**
- Otherwise, use **User Description Mode**

## Workflow

### User Description Mode Workflow
1. **Gather Requirements** - Ask clarifying questions about the feature
2. **Quick Codebase Review** - Explore the codebase to understand structure
3. **Create Design Folder** - Create `.scratchpad/{feature-name}/` directory
4. **Write GitHub Issue** - Create `github-issue.md` for issue creation
5. **Deep Codebase Analysis** - Thoroughly explore relevant code
6. **Write Low-Level Design** - Create `lld.md` with technical details
7. **Expert Review** - Create `review.md` with multi-persona feedback
8. **Write Testing Plan** - Create `testing.md` with functional, backwards-compat, UX, ECS, and E2E tests
9. **Present Summary & Seek Guidance** - Present findings and ask for direction

### GitHub Issue URL Mode Workflow
1. **Fetch GitHub Issue** - Retrieve issue content using `gh` CLI
2. **Analyze Issue Content** - Extract requirements, design elements, and context
3. **Quick Codebase Review** - Explore the codebase to understand structure
4. **Create Design Folder** - Create `.scratchpad/issue-{number}/` directory (e.g., `issue-500` for GitHub issue #500)
5. **Summarize Existing Issue** - Create `github-issue.md` summarizing the existing issue
6. **Clarify Requirements** - Ask user about any gaps or ambiguities found
7. **Deep Codebase Analysis** - Thoroughly explore relevant code
8. **Write Low-Level Design** - Create `lld.md` with technical details
9. **Expert Review** - Create `review.md` with multi-persona feedback
10. **Write Testing Plan** - Create `testing.md` with functional, backwards-compat, UX, ECS, and E2E tests
11. **Present Summary & Seek Guidance** - Present findings and ask for direction

---

## GitHub Issue URL Mode

### Step 1: Fetch GitHub Issue

When a user provides a GitHub issue URL, fetch the issue content using the `gh` CLI:

```bash
# Extract owner, repo, and issue number from URL
# URL format: https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}

# Fetch issue details
gh issue view {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --json title,body,labels,state,assignees,comments

# For more context, also fetch related PRs if any
gh issue view {number} --repo {owner}/{repo} --json linkedPullRequests
```

### Step 2: Analyze Issue Content

After fetching the issue, analyze it for:

1. **Existing Requirements**
   - Problem statement
   - User stories or use cases
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Scope definition

2. **Existing Design Elements**
   - Technical proposals in the issue body
   - Architecture suggestions
   - API designs mentioned
   - Data model proposals
   - Diagrams or pseudocode

3. **Discussion Context**
   - Comments with additional requirements
   - Decisions made in discussion
   - Concerns raised by team members
   - Alternative approaches discussed

4. **Metadata**
   - Labels (indicates feature type, priority)
   - Assignees (who might have context)
   - Linked PRs (prior implementation attempts)

### Step 3: Create Issue Summary

Create a summary document that captures what was found:

```markdown
# GitHub Issue Analysis: #{issue_number}

*Source: {issue_url}*
*Fetched: {date}*

## Issue Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Title | {title} |
| State | {state} |
| Labels | {labels} |
| Assignees | {assignees} |

## Extracted Requirements

### Problem Statement
{extracted or "Not explicitly stated - needs clarification"}

### User Stories
{extracted user stories or "None found"}

### Acceptance Criteria
{extracted criteria or "Not defined - will need to establish"}

### Scope
{inferred scope or "Not specified"}

## Existing Design Elements

### Technical Proposals
{any technical details from issue body}

### Architecture Suggestions
{any architecture mentioned}

### API Design
{any API designs proposed}

### Open Questions in Issue
{questions raised but not answered}

## Discussion Summary

### Key Decisions Made
{decisions from comments}

### Concerns Raised
{concerns from team members}

### Alternative Approaches Mentioned
{alternatives discussed}

## Gaps Identified

The following information is missing and needs clarification:
1. {gap 1}
2. {gap 2}
```

### Step 4: Clarify Requirements

Based on the analysis, ask the user only about gaps not covered in the issue:

1. **Feature name** (derive from issue title if possible, use kebab-case)
2. **Missing requirements** - Only ask about gaps identified
3. **Design decisions** - If alternatives were discussed but not decided
4. **Scope confirmation** - Verify the scope interpretation is correct

Example prompt:
```
I've analyzed GitHub issue #{number}: "{title}"

The issue provides:
- {what's available}

However, I need clarification on:
1. {gap question 1}
2. {gap question 2}

Also, the issue discusses two approaches for {topic}:
- Option A: {description}
- Option B: {description}

Which approach should we pursue in the design?
```

---

## User Description Mode

## Step 1: Gather Requirements

Before creating any files, ask the user:

1. What is the feature name? (will be used for folder name, use kebab-case)
2. What problem does this feature solve?
3. Who are the users/consumers of this feature?
4. Are there any constraints or requirements?
5. What is the expected scope (small/medium/large)?

## Step 2: Quick Codebase Review

Before creating any design documents, perform a quick exploration of the codebase to understand:

1. **Project Structure** - Use Glob to understand the overall directory layout
   - Identify main source directories (`registry/`, `src/`, etc.)
   - Locate existing models, routes, services, and utilities
   - Find configuration files and constants

2. **Related Components** - Search for existing features similar to the one being designed
   - Use Grep to find relevant keywords and patterns
   - Identify existing patterns and conventions used in the codebase

3. **Entry Points** - Understand how the application is structured
   - Find the main FastAPI application and router setup
   - Identify middleware, dependencies, and shared utilities

This quick review should take 5-10 minutes and helps you ask better clarifying questions and avoid proposing designs that conflict with existing architecture.

## Step 3: Create Design Folder

### Folder Naming Convention

**IMPORTANT:** Use different naming conventions based on the input mode:

| Input Mode | Folder Name | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **GitHub Issue URL Mode** | `issue-{number}/` | `issue-500/` for GitHub issue #500 |
| **User Description Mode** | `{feature-name}/` | `rate-limiting/` for a rate limiting feature |

This convention makes it easy to:
- Trace design documents back to their source GitHub issue
- Avoid duplicate work on the same issue
- Organize designs consistently

### Folder Structure

Create the folder structure:

```
.scratchpad/issue-{number}/     # For GitHub Issue URL Mode
# OR
.scratchpad/{feature-name}/     # For User Description Mode

├── github-issue.md    # GitHub issue specification or summary
├── lld.md             # Low-level design document
├── review.md          # Expert review document
└── testing.md         # Testing plan (functional, backwards-compat, UX, ECS, E2E)
```

## Step 4: Write GitHub Issue (github-issue.md)

**For User Description Mode:** Create a comprehensive GitHub issue specification.

**For GitHub Issue URL Mode:** Create a summary document that consolidates the existing issue content with any clarifications gathered. Use the "Issue Summary from URL" template below instead.

### Template: New Issue Specification (User Description Mode)

```markdown
# GitHub Issue: {Feature Title}

## Title
{concise title for the issue}

## Labels
- {appropriate labels from: enhancement, feature-request, api, frontend, backend, etc.}

## Description

### Problem Statement
{What problem does this solve? Why is it needed?}

### Proposed Solution
{High-level description of the solution}

### User Stories
- As a {user type}, I want to {action} so that {benefit}
- ...

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] {Criterion 1}
- [ ] {Criterion 2}
- ...

### Out of Scope
- {What is explicitly NOT included}

### Dependencies
- {Any dependent issues or external dependencies}

### Related Issues
- #{issue numbers if any}
```

### Template: Issue Summary from URL (GitHub Issue URL Mode)

When working from an existing GitHub issue, create a summary document:

```markdown
# Issue Summary: {Issue Title}

*Source Issue: [{owner}/{repo}#{number}]({issue_url})*
*Fetched: {date}*
*Status: {open/closed}*

## Issue Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Labels | {labels} |
| Assignees | {assignees} |
| Created | {created_date} |
| Last Updated | {updated_date} |

## Original Problem Statement

{Copy or summarize the problem statement from the issue body}

## Requirements Extracted

### From Issue Body
{Requirements found in the original issue}

### From Discussion (Comments)
{Additional requirements or clarifications from comments}

### Clarified with User
{Any requirements clarified during our conversation}

## Existing Design Elements

### Technical Approach
{If specified in the issue}

### API Design
{If specified in the issue}

### Data Models
{If specified in the issue}

## Acceptance Criteria

### From Issue
{Criteria from the original issue}

### Additional (Established)
{Any additional criteria we established}

## Scope

{Scope as defined or inferred from the issue}

## Out of Scope

{What is explicitly excluded}

## Key Decisions from Discussion

| Decision | Context | Decided By |
|----------|---------|------------|
| {decision} | {why} | {who/when} |

## Open Questions Resolved

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| {question from issue} | {answer we determined} |

## Dependencies

{Any dependencies mentioned in the issue}

## Notes

{Any additional context or notes relevant to the design}
```

## Step 5: Deep Codebase Analysis

**CRITICAL:** Before writing the LLD, you MUST thoroughly understand all relevant code in the repository. This is not optional - a design that doesn't account for existing code patterns will fail during implementation.

> **REQUIRED: theory alignment.** Read [Theory of the System](../../../docs/design/theory-of-the-system.md)
> and check the proposed feature against its core invariants (single control plane for all asset
> types; the gateway is a generic reverse proxy and the registry is the control plane; registry is
> control-plane-not-data-path for A2A; `DEPLOYMENT_MODE` vs `REGISTRY_MODE`; three-surface config
> parity; fail-closed admission vs fail-open notification; IdP-agnostic across a closed provider
> factory; MCP spec compliance). Use the doc's
> "[how to change this system without breaking its theory](../../../docs/design/theory-of-the-system.md#6-how-to-change-this-system-without-breaking-its-theory)"
> checklist. **If the design would violate an invariant, flag it explicitly to the user** in the
> LLD (a "Theory impact" note) and in the Expert Review — a deliberate theory change is allowed, but
> it must be called out and argued, never slipped in. State which invariant is affected and the
> justification.

### What to Analyze

1. **Existing Models and Data Structures**
   - Read ALL relevant Pydantic models in `registry/models/`
   - Understand field types, validators, and relationships
   - Identify any models that need to be extended or referenced

2. **Service Layer Patterns**
   - Read existing services in `registry/services/`
   - Understand how business logic is organized
   - Identify common patterns (error handling, logging, caching)
   - Note any base classes or utility functions used

3. **Route/API Patterns**
   - Read existing routes in `registry/routes/`
   - Understand request/response patterns
   - Identify how authentication, validation, and error responses are handled
   - Note middleware and dependencies used

4. **Storage Layer**
   - Read storage implementations in `registry/storage/`
   - Understand how data is persisted
   - Identify any abstraction layers or interfaces

5. **Configuration and Constants**
   - Read configuration files and constants
   - Understand environment variable patterns
   - Identify feature flags or configuration options

6. **Existing Tests**
   - Read relevant test files in `tests/`
   - Understand testing patterns and fixtures used
   - Identify how mocking is done

### How to Analyze

Use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore for thorough investigation:

```
Task tool with prompt: "Thoroughly analyze the service layer patterns in registry/services/.
Read all service files and document: 1) Common patterns used, 2) Error handling approaches,
3) Logging conventions, 4) Any base classes or utilities, 5) How services interact with storage."
```

For each area, you should:
- Read the actual code, not just file names
- Understand the "why" behind design decisions
- Note any TODOs or known issues
- Identify code that your feature will need to integrate with

### Document Your Findings

Create a brief section in your LLD documenting:
- Key files reviewed
- Patterns identified
- Integration points for the new feature
- Any constraints or limitations discovered

## Step 6: Write Low-Level Design (lld.md)

Create a detailed technical design document. This is the most critical document - it should contain enough detail for an entry-level developer to implement the feature.

```markdown
# Low-Level Design: {Feature Name}

*Author: Claude*
*Status: Draft*

## Overview

### Problem Statement
{Detailed problem description}

### Goals
- {Goal 1}
- {Goal 2}

### Non-Goals
- {What this design explicitly does NOT address}

### Theory Impact
{State whether this feature upholds or changes any core invariant in
[Theory of the System](../../../docs/design/theory-of-the-system.md). Default: "No invariant
affected." If an invariant IS affected, name it, explain why the change is deliberate and
justified, and note the consequence — this is a flag for the reviewer, not something to bury.}

## Data Models

### New Models
{Define any new Pydantic models with full field definitions}

```python
class NewModel(BaseModel):
    """Description of the model."""

    field_name: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="What this field represents",
        min_length=1,
        max_length=100
    )
    optional_field: Optional[int] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="Optional field description"
    )
```

### Model Changes
{Changes to existing models}

### Database Schema Changes
{If applicable, show collection/table changes}

### Data Access Plan (avoid N+1)
{For each read path the feature introduces, state how the data is fetched.
Any time you need a count or lookup over a list of items, design a single bulk
query or aggregation (`$group`/`$sum`/`$in`/batched fetch) rather than one
query per item. Do NOT design a `for` loop that awaits a repository call per
element. If a per-item read seems unavoidable, justify why and bound the item
count. Note any new repository method (e.g. a `count_*` aggregation) the design
needs so it does not fall back to loading and counting in Python.}

## API Design

### New Endpoints

#### POST /api/v1/{endpoint}

**Description:** {What this endpoint does}

**Request:**
```json
{
    "field": "value"
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
    "id": "123",
    "status": "success"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- 400 Bad Request: {when}
- 401 Unauthorized: {when}
- 404 Not Found: {when}

### API Changes
{Changes to existing endpoints}

## Configuration Parameters

**IMPORTANT:** Clearly document all new configuration parameters this feature requires.

### New Environment Variables

| Variable Name | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|---------------|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `FEATURE_ENABLED` | bool | `true` | No | Enable/disable the feature |
| `FEATURE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | int | `30` | No | Polling interval in seconds |

### Settings Class Updates

Add to `registry/core/config.py`:

```python
    # Feature-specific settings
    feature_enabled: bool = Field(
        default=True,
        description="Enable/disable feature X"
    )
    feature_interval_seconds: int = Field(
        default=30,
        description="Interval for feature X operations"
    )
```

### Configuration Validation

{Any validation rules for configuration values}

### Deployment Surface Checklist

**CRITICAL:** Every new configuration parameter must be propagated to all three deployment surfaces AND documented in the unified parameter reference. Use the checklist below and fill in the file-level details for each new parameter.

#### Unified Parameter Reference (must be updated for every new parameter)

The project maintains a single cross-surface mapping of every parameter at [`docs/unified-parameter-reference.md`](../../../docs/unified-parameter-reference.md). This is the authoritative index for how each logical parameter is named on each surface. **You must update it** whenever a parameter is added, renamed, removed, or re-scoped.

| File | What to Add | Done? |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `docs/unified-parameter-reference.md` | Add one row per new parameter to the correct logical group table: parameter name, Docker `.env` var, Terraform `.tfvars` var, Helm values path, purpose. Mark secrets with **(secret)**. If no existing group fits, add a new group section and explain why in the PR description. If a surface legitimately does not expose the parameter, leave the cell blank and note the reason in the PR. | [ ] |

Verification: `grep` the new variable name across [`.env.example`](../../../.env.example), [`terraform/aws-ecs/terraform.tfvars.example`](../../../terraform/aws-ecs/terraform.tfvars.example), [`charts/`](../../../charts/), AND `docs/unified-parameter-reference.md` — it must appear in all surfaces that the reference file claims it does.

#### Docker Deployment (5 files)

| File | What to Add | Done? |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `.env.example` | Variable with description and default value | [ ] |
| `.env` | Variable with the actual deployment value | [ ] |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Pass variable to the correct service(s) environment block | [ ] |
| `docker-compose.podman.yml` | Same as above (Podman variant) | [ ] |
| `docker-compose.prebuilt.yml` | Same as above (prebuilt-image variant) | [ ] |

#### Terraform / ECS Deployment (5+ files)

| File | What to Add | Done? |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `terraform/aws-ecs/variables.tf` | Root variable definition with description and default | [ ] |
| `terraform/aws-ecs/main.tf` | Pass the variable into the module call | [ ] |
| `terraform/aws-ecs/modules/mcp-gateway/variables.tf` | Module-level variable definition | [ ] |
| `terraform/aws-ecs/modules/mcp-gateway/ecs-services.tf` | Map variable to container environment in ECS task definition | [ ] |
| `terraform/aws-ecs/terraform.tfvars.example` | Documented example value | [ ] |

Sensitive values (tokens, private keys) must use AWS Secrets Manager references.

#### Helm / EKS Deployment (4 files)

| File | What to Add | Done? |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `charts/registry/values.yaml` (or the correct subchart) | Default value under the appropriate section | [ ] |
| `charts/mcp-gateway-registry-stack/values.yaml` | Default value (stack-level chart) | [ ] |
| `charts/<subchart>/templates/secret.yaml` | Add variable if sensitive (base64-encoded), plus support `existingSecret` / `secretKeyRef` | [ ] |
| `charts/<subchart>/templates/deployment.yaml` | Map value to container env var (plain or `secretKeyRef`) | [ ] |

Sensitive values must support `secretKeyRef` for Kubernetes secrets.

#### System Config Page (Backend API + Frontend UI)

New config params must appear on the System Config page in the UI. This requires backend and possibly frontend changes.

| File | What to Add | Done? |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `registry/api/config_routes.py` | Add field to `CONFIG_GROUPS` dict with `(field_name, display_label, is_sensitive)`. Sensitive fields must have `is_sensitive=True` so they are masked via `_mask_sensitive_value()`. | [ ] |
| Frontend (`ConfigPanel.tsx`) | Auto-renders fields from `/api/config/full`. Update only if the new parameters need special UI treatment (toggles, grouped display, color-coded status, etc.). | [ ] |

Verify after deployment: navigate to the System Config page and confirm the new parameter(s) appear with correct values and labels. Sensitive values should be masked. The same data is also available programmatically via `GET /api/config/full` (admin auth required) and can be exported via `GET /api/config/export?format={env|json|tfvars|yaml}`.

## New Dependencies

**IMPORTANT:** List all new Python packages or libraries required by this feature.

### Python Packages

| Package | Version | Purpose | Added By |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| `package-name` | `latest` | {Why needed} | Backend |
| `another-package` | `latest` | {Why needed} | Frontend |

### Adding Dependencies

```bash
# Add to pyproject.toml
uv add package-name
```

### No New Dependencies

If no new dependencies are required, explicitly state:
- "This feature uses only existing dependencies from the project."

## Implementation Details

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1: {First Step}

**File:** `path/to/file.py`
**Lines:** {approximate line numbers or "new file"}

```python
# Pseudo-code or actual code
def new_function(
    param1: str,
    param2: int
) -> dict:
    """
    Description of what this function does.

    Args:
        param1: Description
        param2: Description

    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    # Step 1: Validate input
    if not param1:
        raise ValueError("param1 is required")

    # Step 2: Process data
    result = process_data(param1, param2)

    # Step 3: Return response
    return {"status": "success", "data": result}

| `registry/models/domain.py` | ~100-150 | Add new model |

### API Client Updates (IMPORTANT)

**When new API endpoints are added or modified, the following files MUST also be updated:**

| File Path | Update Required |
|-----------|-----------------|
| `api/registry_client.py` | Add Pydantic response models and client methods for new endpoints |
| `api/registry_management.py` | Add CLI commands (argparse parsers) and handler functions |
| `api/openapi.json` | Regenerate OpenAPI spec if using auto-generation |

**Example additions for a new endpoint `GET /api/feature/{path}/data`:**

```python
# In api/registry_client.py:
class FeatureDataResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response model for feature data endpoint."""
    path: str = Field(..., description="Feature path")
    data: dict = Field(..., description="Feature data")

def get_feature_data(self, path: str) -> FeatureDataResponse:
    """Get feature data from the registry."""
    response = self._make_request("GET", f"/api/feature/{path}/data")
    return FeatureDataResponse(**response)

# In api/registry_management.py:
def cmd_feature_data(args: argparse.Namespace) -> None:
    """Get feature data command handler."""
    client = _get_client(args)
    result = client.get_feature_data(path=args.path)
    # Display result...
```

This ensures the registry management CLI stays in sync with backend API capabilities.

## Backend Engineer Review

**Reviewer:** Byte
**Focus Areas:** API design, data models, business logic, database queries, performance

### Assessment

#### Strengths
- {Positive aspects from backend perspective}

#### N+1 Access Pattern Check (MANDATORY)
Inspect every data-access path in the design. Flag any pattern that reads from
a database or data source once per item (a `count()` / `find_one()` / `get()` /
`distinct()` or repository call inside a `for`/`while`/comprehension/per-item
callback, or a service that internally queries per element). State the fix: a
single bulk query or aggregation (`$group`/`$sum`/`$in`/batched fetch) outside
the loop. `asyncio.gather` over a per-item list is still N+1 round-trips; flag
it unless the item count is small and bounded.
- **N+1 patterns:** {None found / FLAGGED: <where + the per-item read and the bulk-query fix>}

#### Concerns
- {Issues or risks identified}

#### New Libraries Required

| Library | Version | Purpose | Justification |
|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| `library-name` | `latest` | {What it does} | {Why it's needed vs alternatives} |

## Security Engineer Review

**Reviewer:** Cipher
**Focus Areas:** Authentication, authorization, input validation, data protection, OWASP

> **Before writing this section, read [security-patterns.md](../pr-review/personas/security-patterns.md)** — the catalog of security defects that have shipped and been fixed in this project. Design the feature so it does not reintroduce any of them (SSRF on outbound fetches, broken access control / info disclosure on new endpoints, weak defaults, token-boundary confusion, missing CSRF, injection, log/secret leakage, agent execution safety). Call out in the Concerns/Recommendations below which patterns this feature touches and how the design avoids them.

### Assessment

#### Strengths
- {Positive aspects from security perspective}

#### Concerns
- {Issues or risks identified}

#### Security Checklist
See [security-patterns.md#review-checklist](../pr-review/personas/security-patterns.md#review-checklist) for the full per-pattern list. Key items:
- [ ] Outbound fetches of stored/request-supplied URLs go through the SSRF guard (pattern #1)
- [ ] New GET endpoints strip backend URLs for non-admins; mutations 404-then-403 on resolved identity (pattern #2)
- [ ] No new secret ships with a working default; new env vars added to reserved-name + weak-secret lists (pattern #3)
- [ ] Inbound auth headers stripped on egress; JWTs verified; no client-supplied session id trusted (pattern #4)
- [ ] Every mutating endpoint carries the CSRF dependency (pattern #5)
- [ ] No untrusted input interpolated into nginx/query/HTML/href without escaping (pattern #6)
- [ ] No secrets/headers/OIDC claim values logged; secret fields write-only in responses (pattern #7)
- [ ] Mutating agent tools gated behind confirmation; agent endpoints authenticate (pattern #9)

#### Recommendations
1. {Specific recommendation}
2. {Specific recommendation}

### Sign-Off

- [ ] All blockers resolved

- [ ] Ready for implementation
```

## Important Guidelines

### Design Principles
- Favor simple designs over unnecessary complexity
- Prefer straightforward code over clever solutions
- Design for maintainability by entry-level developers
- Add observability from the start, not as an afterthought

### Documentation Quality
1. **Be Thorough**: The LLD should be detailed enough that someone unfamiliar with the codebase can implement it
2. **Use Diagrams**: ASCII diagrams help visualize the design
3. **Include Code**: Show actual or pseudo-code for key functions
4. **Specify Files**: Always mention which files to create/modify and approximate line numbers
5. **Consider All Aspects**: Think about error handling, logging, testing, and deployment
6. **Expert Reviews**: Make the reviews realistic - identify actual issues, not just praise
7. **Never announce the feature in `README.md`**: feature documentation goes to the feature's own
   docs page (create one if it lacks one) and, on release, to `docs/release-notes/` plus a single
   curated highlight in `docs/overview/feature-release-highlights.md`. The README's "What's New"
   section is limited to the 3 most-recent highlights and is rotated only by the `release-notes`
   skill; it has a CI-enforced 350-line budget. A design must not plan to add README sections or
   inline feature blurbs — call out the docs page it will add instead.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: User Description Mode

User: "Design a new feature for rate limiting on tool calls"

1. Ask clarifying questions about rate limiting requirements
2. Quick codebase review to understand existing architecture
3. Create `.scratchpad/rate-limiting/`
4. Write `github-issue.md` with rate limiting requirements
5. Deep codebase analysis of relevant services
6. Write `lld.md` with:
   - Architecture showing rate limiter component
   - Sequence diagram for rate-limited requests
   - Redis/in-memory counter data structures
   - API changes for rate limit headers
   - Middleware implementation details
   - Configuration options
7. Write `review.md` with expert feedback on:
   - Frontend: How to display rate limit info to users
   - Backend: Algorithm choice, storage considerations
   - SRE: Redis availability, monitoring needs
   - Security: Rate limit bypass prevention
   - SMTS: Overall architecture fit
8. Write `testing.md` with:
   - Functional curl tests for the rate limit headers endpoint
   - `registry_management.py` tests for any new CLI flags
   - Backwards-compat tests confirming existing endpoints still respond identically when under limit
   - UX tests for surfacing rate limit feedback in the UI
   - ECS/terraform tests for any new env vars (e.g. `RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL`)
   - E2E test exercising multiple requests to trigger and recover from a rate-limited state
9. Present summary and seek guidance on recommendations

### Example 2: GitHub Issue URL Mode

User: "https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry/issues/456"

1. Fetch issue #456 using `gh issue view 456 --repo agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry --json title,body,labels,state,comments`
2. Analyze the issue content:
   - Extract: "Add support for federated registry syncing"
   - Found: Problem statement, some acceptance criteria
   - Missing: Specific sync frequency, conflict resolution strategy
3. Quick codebase review to understand registry architecture
4. Create `.scratchpad/issue-456/` (folder named after the GitHub issue number)
5. Ask user only about gaps:
   - "The issue mentions syncing but doesn't specify frequency. What sync interval should we design for?"
   - "The issue discusses conflicts but doesn't specify resolution. Should we use last-write-wins or require manual resolution?"
6. Write `github-issue.md` summarizing the issue with clarifications
7. Deep codebase analysis of registry and storage layers
8. Write `lld.md` incorporating:
   - Requirements from original issue
   - Design elements proposed in issue comments
   - Clarifications from user
   - Technical details for implementation
9. Write `review.md` with expert feedback
10. Write `testing.md` with:
    - Functional curl tests for new sync endpoints and existing endpoints that now honor sync state
    - `registry_management.py` tests for any new sync-related CLI commands
    - Backwards-compat tests confirming non-federated deployments are unaffected
    - UX tests for any UI indicators showing federated/synced resources
    - ECS/terraform tests for new sync config vars (e.g. `FEDERATION_PEER_URLS`, `FEDERATION_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS`)
    - E2E test exercising a two-registry sync cycle and conflict resolution
11. Present summary noting:
    - What came from the original issue
    - What was clarified during design
    - Recommendations for implementation

## Step 8: Write Testing Plan (testing.md)

Create a comprehensive testing plan document that captures **executable, copy-pasteable tests** covering every externally observable change introduced by the feature. The goal is for a reviewer or implementer to be able to walk through this document and verify the feature works end-to-end without having to invent test cases.

### When Each Test Category Applies

Include a category only when it is relevant to the feature. Mark a category "Not Applicable" with a short justification when it does not apply.

| Category | Include When |
|----------|--------------|
| Functional Tests (curl) | Feature adds/modifies any HTTP endpoint |
| Functional Tests (registry_management.py) | Feature adds/modifies anything exposed via the management CLI |
| Backwards Compatibility Tests | Feature changes an existing endpoint, schema, CLI command, config default, or data model |
| UX Tests | Feature adds/changes any UI surface (web UI, CLI output formatting, error messages shown to users) |
| Deployment Surface Tests (Docker, ECS, Helm) | Feature adds or modifies **any** config parameter (env var, setting, Terraform variable, Helm value, secret) across Docker, ECS/Terraform, or Helm/EKS deployments |
| Nginx Routing / MCP Proxy Tests | Feature touches nginx config generation (`nginx_service.py`), auth server mcp-proxy (`/mcp-proxy/`), or any proxy_pass/location-block logic |
| E2E API Tests | Feature adds a new user-visible workflow that spans multiple endpoints or services |

### CRITICAL: Nginx Routing Safety

Any change that impacts nginx routing (in `registry/core/nginx_service.py`, `auth_server/server.py` mcp-proxy, or nginx template files) MUST include an end-to-end MCP client connectivity test. This is because:

1. **Health checks do not exercise the nginx proxy path.** They call backends directly (127.0.0.1), so a broken proxy_pass goes undetected by monitoring.
2. **The REST API does not use the MCP proxy path.** UI and API tests pass even when MCP routing is broken.
3. **Only real MCP clients** (Roo Code, Claude Code, Cursor) connecting through the gateway exercise the full path: CloudFront -> ALB -> nginx location block -> auth_request -> mcp-proxy hop -> upstream backend.

**Required test for any nginx routing change:**

```bash
# Verify ai-registry-tools (mcpgw) is reachable through the full proxy chain
TOKEN="<valid JWT>"
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}},"id":1}' \
  "https://<registry-url>/airegistry-tools/mcp"

# Expected: 200 OK with JSON-RPC response containing serverInfo
# Failure: 502/404/405 or "Upstream MCP server error"
```

This test must pass on all deployment surfaces (Docker Compose, ECS, EKS) before merging. The `airegistry-tools` server is the canary for MCP proxy routing because it is always registered and always healthy.

## 1. Functional Tests

### 1.1 curl Tests (HTTP API)

For each new or modified endpoint, provide a copy-pasteable curl command, the expected response, and the assertion being verified.

#### Test 1.1.1: {Endpoint description, e.g. "Create resource X"}

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/{path}`

**Command:**
```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$REGISTRY_URL/api/v1/{path}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "field1": "value1",
        "field2": 42
      }' \
  | jq
```

**Expected Status:** `200 OK` (or `201 Created`)

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "{id}",
  "status": "success"
}
```

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Response contains `id` field
- [ ] `status == "success"`
- [ ] {Any side effect to verify, e.g. record exists in DB}

**Negative Case:**
```bash
# Missing required field should return 400
curl -sS -X POST "$REGISTRY_URL/api/v1/{path}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' -w "\n%{http_code}\n"
```
Expected: `400` with validation error body.

#### Test 1.1.2: {Next endpoint}
{Repeat the structure above for each endpoint}

### 1.2 registry_management.py CLI Tests

For each new or modified CLI command exposed via `api/registry_management.py`, provide the exact invocation and expected output.

#### Test 1.2.1: {Command description, e.g. "Register a new feature resource"}

**Command:**
```bash
cd api
uv run python registry_management.py {subcommand} \
  --token-file "../$TOKEN_FILE" \
  --registry-url "$REGISTRY_URL" \
  --{new-param} "{value}"
```

**Expected Output (key fragments):**
```
Successfully created {resource}: <id>
```

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Exit code is `0`

- [ ] Follow-up `list` command shows the resource

**Follow-up Verification:**
```bash
uv run python registry_management.py list \
  --token-file "../$TOKEN_FILE" \
  --registry-url "$REGISTRY_URL"
```

#### Test 1.2.2: {Next command}
{Repeat the structure above}

---

## 2. Backwards Compatibility Tests

*Include this section if the feature touches any existing endpoint, schema, CLI command, default value, or data model. Otherwise replace with: "**Not Applicable** - feature introduces only net-new surface area: {justification}".*

### 2.1 Existing API Contract

Goal: confirm that existing clients continue to work without code changes.

#### Test 2.1.1: Legacy request shape still accepted

**Command (pre-feature request body):**
```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$REGISTRY_URL/api/v1/{existing-endpoint}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "legacy_field": "value"
      }' | jq
```

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Returns `200` (not `400`)
- [ ] Response contains all previously documented fields
- [ ] New optional fields either absent or have sensible defaults

### 2.2 Existing CLI Behavior

#### Test 2.2.1: CLI command without new flags behaves as before

```bash
uv run python registry_management.py {existing-command} \
  --token-file "../$TOKEN_FILE" \
  --registry-url "$REGISTRY_URL"
```

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Exit code `0`
- [ ] Output format unchanged (diff against pre-change baseline if available)

### 2.3 Default Behavior When New Config Unset

- [ ] Feature disabled by default (or matches prior behavior) when new env vars are unset
- [ ] No new required config parameter breaks existing deployments

---

## 3. UX Tests

*Include this section if the feature changes any user-facing surface (web UI, CLI output, error messages). Otherwise replace with: "**Not Applicable** - feature is internal only, with no UX changes."*

### 3.1 Web UI Tests

For each UI change, describe the manual test steps.

#### Test 3.1.1: {UI flow, e.g. "Display new resource in listing"}

**Steps:**
1. Log in to the registry UI at `$REGISTRY_URL`
2. Navigate to {page}
3. Verify {visible element} renders correctly
4. {Action, e.g. click "Create"}
5. Verify {expected outcome}

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Element visible at correct position
- [ ] No console errors in browser devtools
- [ ] Responsive behavior at mobile width works
- [ ] Accessible: keyboard navigation and screen-reader labels present

### 3.2 CLI Output / Error Message Tests

#### Test 3.2.1: Error message is actionable

```bash
uv run python registry_management.py {command} --invalid-flag bad-value
```

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Error clearly states what was invalid
- [ ] Error suggests the correct usage
- [ ] No stack trace leaked to user

---

## 4. Deployment Surface Tests (Docker, ECS, Helm)

*Include this section whenever the feature adds or modifies ANY config parameter (env var, setting, Terraform variable, Helm value, secret). Otherwise replace with: "**Not Applicable** - feature introduces no new config parameters. Verified by reviewing diff of `registry/core/config.py`."*

### 4.0 Unified Parameter Reference Updated

Before any surface-specific wiring tests, confirm the cross-surface index was updated.

| Check | Verification Command |
|-------|----------------------|
| New parameter row(s) added to `docs/unified-parameter-reference.md` | `grep -n "<PARAM_NAME>" docs/unified-parameter-reference.md` |
| Each cell points to a file that actually contains the variable | `grep -rn "<PARAM_NAME>" .env.example terraform/aws-ecs/terraform.tfvars.example charts/` |

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Parameter appears in `docs/unified-parameter-reference.md` in the correct group (or a new group is added with justification)
- [ ] Docker, Terraform, and Helm cells for the new row are either filled in **or** explicitly blank with a note in the PR description
- [ ] Secrets are flagged with **(secret)** in the reference
- [ ] The `/api/config/full` endpoint returns the new parameter (sensitive values masked)

### 4.1 Docker Deployment Wiring

For each new config parameter, confirm it is present in all Docker deployment files.

| Config Parameter | Env Var Name | Verification Command |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `feature_enabled` | `FEATURE_ENABLED` | `grep FEATURE_ENABLED .env.example docker-compose*.yml` |

- [ ] `docker-compose up -d` starts successfully with the new variable

### 4.2 Terraform / ECS Variable Wiring

For each new config parameter, confirm it is plumbed through the ECS deployment.

| Config Parameter | Env Var Name | Added To | Verification Command |
|------------------|--------------|----------|----------------------|
| `feature_enabled` | `FEATURE_ENABLED` | `terraform/aws-ecs/variables.tf` + `ecs-services.tf` | `grep -rn FEATURE_ENABLED terraform/aws-ecs/` |
| `feature_interval_seconds` | `FEATURE_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `terraform/aws-ecs/variables.tf` + `ecs-services.tf` | `grep -rn FEATURE_INTERVAL_SECONDS terraform/aws-ecs/` |

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Root variable defined in `terraform/aws-ecs/variables.tf` with description and default
- [ ] Variable passed to module in `terraform/aws-ecs/main.tf`
- [ ] Module variable defined in `terraform/aws-ecs/modules/mcp-gateway/variables.tf`
- [ ] Variable mapped to container env in `terraform/aws-ecs/modules/mcp-gateway/ecs-services.tf`
- [ ] Example value in `terraform/aws-ecs/terraform.tfvars.example`

### 4.3 Terraform Plan/Apply Verification

```bash
cd terraform/aws-ecs
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan -var 'feature_enabled=true' -var 'feature_interval_seconds=60'
```

**Assertions:**
- [ ] `terraform validate` passes
- [ ] `terraform plan` shows the new variable in the ECS task definition env block
- [ ] No unintended changes to unrelated resources

### 4.4 Helm / EKS Variable Wiring

For each new config parameter, confirm it is plumbed through the Helm charts.

| Config Parameter | Helm Value Path | Verification Command |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| `feature_enabled` | `registry.featureEnabled` | `grep -rn FEATURE_ENABLED charts/` |
| `feature_interval_seconds` | `registry.featureIntervalSeconds` | `grep -rn FEATURE_INTERVAL_SECONDS charts/` |

**Assertions:**
- [ ] Default value in `charts/registry/values.yaml`
- [ ] Default value in `charts/mcp-gateway-registry-stack/values.yaml`
- [ ] Sensitive values added to `charts/registry/templates/secret.yaml` (base64-encoded)
- [ ] Variable mapped to container env in `charts/registry/templates/deployment.yaml`
- [ ] `helm template charts/registry` renders the new env var correctly

### 4.5 Deploy and Verify on ECS

```bash
cd terraform/aws-ecs
terraform apply -var 'feature_enabled=true' -var 'feature_interval_seconds=60'
```

**Post-Deploy Assertions:**
- [ ] ECS service reaches `RUNNING` state
- [ ] CloudWatch logs show the feature initialized with the configured values
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns `200` against the deployed ALB/CloudFront URL
- [ ] Re-run the Functional Tests from section 1 against the deployed `$REGISTRY_URL`

### 4.6 Rollback Verification

- [ ] `terraform apply` with `feature_enabled=false` disables the feature cleanly
- [ ] Reverting to the previous task definition restores prior behavior (backwards compat holds in deployed env)

## 5. End-to-End API Tests

*Include this section if the feature adds a user-visible workflow that spans multiple endpoints or services. Otherwise replace with: "**Not Applicable** - feature is a single-endpoint change, covered by Functional Tests section 1."*

### 5.1 E2E Scenario: {Scenario Name}

**Goal:** {business outcome being exercised, e.g. "A tenant onboards, registers a server, invokes a tool, and tears down the resources"}

**Setup:**
```bash
# Generate token, set env vars (see Shared Variables above)
export RUN_ID=$(date +%s)
```

**Steps (each step is executable):**

1. **Create prerequisite resources**
   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST "$REGISTRY_URL/api/v1/{pre-req}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -d '{ "name": "e2e-'$RUN_ID'" }'
   ```

2. **Exercise the new feature**
   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST "$REGISTRY_URL/api/v1/{new-endpoint}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     -d '{ "ref": "e2e-'$RUN_ID'" }'
   ```

3. **Verify cross-service side effect**
   ```bash
   curl -sS "$REGISTRY_URL/api/v1/{downstream-check}/e2e-$RUN_ID" | jq
   ```

4. **Teardown**
   ```bash
   curl -sS -X DELETE "$REGISTRY_URL/api/v1/{pre-req}/e2e-$RUN_ID"
   ```

**Assertions:**
- [ ] All steps return expected status codes
- [ ] Final state matches expected (resource visible in listing, metrics emitted, logs present)
- [ ] Teardown leaves the system in its original state

### 5.2 Reuse of Existing E2E Harness

If `api/test-management-api-e2e.sh` already exercises adjacent flows, extend it rather than duplicating:

- [ ] Add new test phase to `api/test-management-api-e2e.sh`
- [ ] Document additions in `api/test-management-api-e2e.md`
- [ ] Run full harness locally and against the ECS deployment

```bash
cd api
./test-management-api-e2e.sh --token-file ../$TOKEN_FILE --registry-url "$REGISTRY_URL"
```

---

## 6. Test Execution Checklist

Copy this checklist into the PR description when implementing the feature:

- [ ] Section 1 (Functional) - all curl tests pass against local deployment
- [ ] Section 1 (Functional) - all `registry_management.py` commands succeed
- [ ] Section 2 (Backwards Compat) - verified or marked Not Applicable with justification
- [ ] Section 3 (UX) - verified or marked Not Applicable with justification
- [ ] Section 4 (Deployment Surfaces: Docker, ECS, Helm) - verified or marked Not Applicable with justification
- [ ] Section 5 (E2E) - verified or marked Not Applicable with justification
- [ ] Unit tests added in `tests/unit/`
- [ ] Integration tests added in `tests/integration/`
- [ ] `uv run pytest tests/ -n 8` passes with no regressions
```

### Guidance for Generating testing.md

1. **Make tests copy-pasteable.** Use the exact env var conventions (`REGISTRY_URL`, `TOKEN_FILE`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`) and match the style of `api/test-management-api-e2e.sh`.
2. **Cover every new endpoint and every new CLI command.** If the LLD adds three endpoints and two CLI commands, section 1 must have at least five subsections.
3. **Anchor ECS tests on concrete files.** Reference `terraform/aws-ecs/ecs.tf`, `variables.tf`, and any module under `terraform/aws-ecs/modules/` that the parameter flows through. Do not write generic "deploy and verify" wording - name the files.
4. **Mark Not Applicable explicitly.** Do not silently omit sections - always include the heading with a short justification, so reviewers see that the category was considered.
5. **Align with backwards-compat rules.** If the LLD introduces a schema change, the backwards-compat section must test the pre-change request/response shapes.
6. **Do not invent endpoints or flags.** Every curl URL, every `registry_management.py` flag, and every Terraform variable must exist in the LLD or the current codebase.
