An open-source [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that gives LLMs structured intelligence about the EU AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, as amended by the Digital Omnibus, Regulation (EU) 2026/1744).

Built by [Lexbeam Software](https://lexbeam.com) - an agentic AI implementation boutique for regulated workflows.

## What's new in 1.4.5

Version 1.4.5 is the npm follow-up to the 1.4.4 correctness release. It includes
the complete 1.4.4 audit fixes and removes em dashes from documentation and served
prose without changing legal rules, schemas, or tool behavior.

- **Twenty correctness fixes** from a three-artifact audit with cross-model validation
  (details in CHANGELOG): honest FAQ answers with `matched_question`, a reachable
  `minimal` classification reconciled against the description text, a scoped
  Annex III(1)(a) verification exclusion, GPAI abstention instead of false negatives,
  penalty input guards plus the Art. 99(6a) SMC rule, and an article corpus current
  with the amended act including the new Art. 4a.
- **All citation links point at the consolidated text** (CELEX 02024R1689-20260727).
- **A pinned legal corpus** (`law/`) and two new gates: a 66-check claim matrix
  against the corpus and a 48-check post-serialization schema gate. The suite is
  date- and timezone-stable through 2031.

## Quick Start

### npx (no install)

```bash
npx -y @lexbeam-software/eu-ai-act-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eu-ai-act": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@lexbeam-software/eu-ai-act-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Smithery

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest mcp add lexbeam-software/eu-ai-act
```

Direct MCP endpoint: `https://mcp.lexbeam.com/mcp` (health check at `/health`). Open, no auth required.

The Smithery-hosted endpoint `https://eu-ai-act--lexbeam-software.run.tools` requires Smithery authentication and returns 401 without it.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lexbeam-software/eu-ai-act-mcp.git
cd eu-ai-act-mcp
npm install
npm run build
npm start        # stdio transport
npm run start:http  # streamable HTTP (for Smithery/Railway)
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `euaiact_classify_system` | Classify an AI system's risk level (prohibited / high-risk / limited / minimal) from free text **or** structured signals. Returns matched signals, missing signals, and follow-up questions. |
| `euaiact_check_deadlines` | Implementation milestones with days remaining, `next_milestone` shortcut, `only_upcoming` filter, and the enacted Digital Omnibus (Regulation (EU) 2026/1744) status. |
| `euaiact_get_obligations` | Specific compliance obligations by role (provider/deployer) and risk level, including GPAI (Art. 51-56) and universal AI literacy (Art. 4). |
| `euaiact_answer_question` | Keyword FAQ search (lexical matching with stopword filtering, tie handling and abstention) across 24 curated EU AI Act questions; echoes your question and names the matched entry. |
| `euaiact_calculate_penalty` | Calculate maximum fines by violation type, turnover, SME status (Art. 99(6)) and SMC status (Art. 99(6a), tiers 99(4)-(5) only), with a comparative non-SME vs SME block. |
| `euaiact_get_article` | Retrieve an operational summary and EUR-Lex URL for a specific article. Covers 28 curated articles between Art. 3 and Art. 113 (including the new Art. 4a), not the full act. |
| `euaiact_check_gpai_systemic_risk` | Check whether a GPAI model crosses the 10²⁵ FLOPs threshold and return Art. 53 + Art. 55 obligations plus the Art. 52 notification duty. |
| `euaiact_assess_art6_3_exception` | Walk through the Art. 6(3) "no significant risk" exception with explicit profiling block and Art. 6(4) / Art. 49(2) reminders. |
| `euaiact_annex_iv_checklist` | Return all nine Annex IV technical-documentation items, optionally as a markdown checklist. |

## Resources

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `euaiact://timeline` | Key implementation milestones of the EU AI Act. |
| `euaiact://risk-levels` | Overview of the four risk categories. |
| `euaiact://annex/iii` | Full Annex III high-risk AI categories (1-8) with descriptions, examples, and article references. |
| `euaiact://annex/iv` | Full Annex IV technical-documentation items (1-9). |
| `euaiact://omnibus` | The Digital Omnibus on AI (Regulation (EU) 2026/1744) as enacted: amended dates, deltas, and source status per item. |

## Prompts

- `classify-my-system` - guided classification using `euaiact_classify_system` with signal inference
- `compliance-checklist` - risk-level + role obligations checklist, including Annex IV for high-risk
- `penalty-risk-assessment` - penalty calculation with SME comparative
- `ground-citation` - retrieve article text + EUR-Lex URL for grounded citations

## Knowledge Base

Curated, structured data covering:

- **8 Annex III high-risk categories** with keyword matching and examples
- **10 prohibited AI practices**: Art. 5(1)(a)-(h), plus (ba) and (bb) applying from 2 December 2026
- **Art. 6(3) exception conditions** with the profiling block rule
- **Art. 50 transparency triggers** (chatbots, deepfakes, emotion recognition, machine-readable marking)
- **8 implementation milestones** with dynamic days-remaining calculation
- **Digital Omnibus (enacted)** status and impact assessment
- **Provider obligations** (13 for high-risk, 8 for GPAI including Art. 53 + Art. 55)
- **Deployer obligations** (9 for high-risk)
- **Limited-risk transparency obligations** (4 under Art. 50)
- **Universal AI literacy** (Art. 4)
- **Penalty framework** with SME protection logic (Art. 99)
- **24 FAQ entries** with article references and Lexbeam knowledge-base links
- **28 article summaries** with EUR-Lex URLs to the consolidated text
- **Annex IV (9 documentation items)** *(new in 1.1.0)*

Load-bearing dates, thresholds, amounts and exceptions are checked on every build by a claim matrix (`test-claims.mjs`) against a pinned, hash-verified copy of the consolidated act (`law/`). Coverage is the matrix, not a blanket claim.

## Regulatory Accuracy

This server tracks the current state of the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689) **as amended by the Digital Omnibus on AI**, Regulation (EU) 2026/1744, published in the Official Journal on 24 July 2026 and in force from 27 July 2026. The amended application dates are served as operative law. Article-level wording was verified against the enacted OJ text on 26 and 27 July 2026, delta by delta against the 43 numbered amendments in Article 1 of the amending act. No Omnibus delta was left unresolved in that reconciliation. The Art. 49 registration duty for self-assessed not-high-risk systems, previously carried as unresolved, SURVIVES: the enacted act does not amend Art. 49 and deletes only Annex VIII Section B points 7 and 9.

Operative dates as amended:
- **2 Feb 2025** - Prohibited practices (Art. 5) + AI literacy (Art. 4), in effect
- **2 Aug 2025** - GPAI model obligations, in effect
- **2 Aug 2026** - Art. 50 transparency, and Commission GPAI enforcement powers and fines. **Not deferred**
- **2 Dec 2026** - The two new Art. 5 prohibitions (non-consensual intimate material, CSAM), and the Art. 111(4) deadline for synthetic-content systems already on the market to meet Art. 50(2)
- **2 Aug 2027** - Legacy GPAI models (Art. 111(3)), unchanged
- **2 Dec 2027** - High-risk Annex III obligations. Deferred from 2 Aug 2026
- **2 Aug 2028** - High-risk Annex I regulated products. Deferred from 2 Aug 2027
