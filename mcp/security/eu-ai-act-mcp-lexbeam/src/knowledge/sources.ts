/**
 * Source-state registry for the EU AI Act MCP.

 * The product's core promise is that binding law is never confused with
 * proposals, political agreements, draft guidance, or voluntary codes.
 * Every non-OJ statement the server makes must carry an explicit
 * `SourceStatus`. Current OJ law (`enacted_oj`) is the default answer;
 * everything else is surfaced only when a caller opts in, and always
 * with its status attached.
 *
 * Only sources that have been cross-read in-house against their primary
 * text or the official Commission page are listed here. Guidance,
 * standards, and code-of-practice sources from the 2026-06-15 research
 * memo are intentionally NOT yet included; they are a verified follow-on.

/**
 * Legislative maturity ordering (least to most binding):
 *   commission_proposal < political_agreement < adopted_pending_publication < enacted_oj
 * The guideline / study / code statuses are non-legislative and sit outside
 * that ordering. `adopted_pending_publication` is the tier for an act that
 * both co-legislators have formally adopted but that has not yet been
 * published in the Official Journal: it is NOT law until publication.

This entry documents those stages only; it does not state the current legal status. The live enactment state is held in the single `omnibusEnactment` record in digital-omnibus.ts and, once that record is filled, is served as the derived `omnibus_oj` source with the CELEX, OJ date and entry into force. Agreement-stage dates were verified on 2026-06-15 against the official Commission overview page (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai), which is a policy page rather than an OJ legal instrument and is therefore not listed here as a separate enacted source.",
