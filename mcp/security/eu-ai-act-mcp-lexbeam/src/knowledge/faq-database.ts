  : "The Digital Omnibus on AI (Commission proposal COM(2025) 836 of 19 November 2025, procedure 2025/0359(COD)) amends Regulation (EU) 2024/1689. After the political agreement of 7 May 2026 it has been FORMALLY ADOPTED by both co-legislators: the European Parliament endorsed it on 16 June 2026 and the Council gave its final adoption on 29 June 2026. It is NOT yet published in the Official Journal and therefore not yet in force; it takes legal effect on OJ publication, entering into force on the third day after publication. Once in force, the headline changes are: Annex III high-risk obligations deferred from 2 August 2026 to 2 December 2027, and Annex I product-integrated high-risk obligations deferred from 2 August 2027 to 2 August 2028. NOT deferred: Art. 50 transparency obligations and the Commission's GPAI enforcement powers and fines still apply from 2 August 2026, GPAI obligations remain in force since 2 August 2025, and the legacy GPAI compliance date stays 2 August 2027. The Art. 5 prohibited-practices list is expanded (non-consensual intimate imagery / CSAM), not delayed. Until OJ publication, Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 as published remains authoritative for compliance planning; use euaiact_check_deadlines with include_pending_omnibus for the adopted changes with source-status labels.";

    question: "How do I classify my AI system under the EU AI Act?",
    answer:
      "Classification follows a risk-based approach across four tiers: prohibited (Art. 5), high-risk (Art. 6 + Annex III and Annex I), limited risk requiring transparency (Art. 50), and minimal risk with no specific obligations. Start by checking Art. 5 for prohibited practices, then Art. 6(1) for safety components in regulated products (Annex I), then Art. 6(2) for the eight Annex III use-case categories. If your system falls into Annex III, check whether the Art. 6(3) exception applies.",

    answer:
      "Providers and deployers of high-risk AI systems under Annex III must comply by 2 December 2027, as deferred by the Digital Omnibus on AI. Providers need risk management systems (Art. 9), technical documentation (Art. 11), conformity assessments (Art. 43), and EU database registration where Art. 49 applies (Annex III systems except point 2, plus Art. 6(3) registrations). Deployers need human oversight processes (Art. 26), and a FRIA where Art. 27 applies, including public-law/public-service deployers and deployers of Annex III(5)(b)/(c) credit and life/health-insurance systems. Note: Art. 5 prohibited practices and Art. 4 AI literacy are already enforceable since February 2025. This changed with the Digital Omnibus on AI (Regulation (EU) 2026/1744, OJ of 24 July 2026, in force 27 July 2026): the Annex III high-risk application date is deferred to 2 December 2027 and the Annex I date to 2 August 2028.

    question: "What's the difference between provider and deployer under the EU AI Act?",
    answer:
      "A provider (Art. 3(3)) develops or commissions an AI system and places it on the market or puts it into service under their own name or trademark. A deployer (Art. 3(4)) uses an AI system under their authority, except where used for personal non-professional activity. The distinction matters because providers carry heavier obligations (design, documentation, conformity) while deployers focus on proper use, oversight, and monitoring. A deployer becomes a provider if they substantially modify the system or put it on the market under their own name (Art. 25).",

While the AI Act does not prescribe a specific governance framework by name, providers of high-risk AI systems must implement a quality management system (Art. 17) covering regulatory compliance strategy, design procedures, testing protocols, data management, risk management, and post-market monitoring. Deployers must ensure competent human oversight (Art. 26). In practice, this means establishing an internal AI governance framework with clear roles, processes, and accountability structures.",

The process involves: (1) identifying and analysing risks, (2) estimating and evaluating risks arising from intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse, (3) adopting suitable risk management measures, and (4) testing against defined metrics before market placement. The risk management system must be documented and maintained throughout the AI system's lifecycle.",

    answer:
      "The three regulations overlap in cybersecurity, risk management, and incident reporting. DORA (financial sector) and NIS2 (essential/important entities) both require ICT risk management that feeds into the AI Act's Art. 15 (cybersecurity) and Art. 9 (risk management) requirements. Incident reporting under Art. 73 of the AI Act may overlap with NIS2 and DORA incident reporting. The Digital Omnibus on AI (proposed 19 November 2025, now Regulation (EU) 2026/1744, in force 27 July 2026) aims to align these reporting obligations, and additionally routes serious-incident reporting for systems under AI Office exclusive competence to the AI Office by derogation from Art. 73 (new Art. 75(1a)). Organisations should map their obligations across all three and avoid duplicating efforts.",

      "Art. 4 requires providers and deployers to take measures to SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT of AI literacy of staff and other persons operating AI systems on their behalf. It has been applicable since 2 February 2025 and was REPLACED with effect from 27 July 2026 by Regulation (EU) 2026/1744: the text now states expressly that the obligation does not require guaranteeing any specific level of AI literacy in any individual, so this is a duty of demonstrable effort, not of measured competence. New Art. 4(2) puts a supporting duty on the Commission and Member States, including practical compliance examples on the single information platform. Implementation should cover: understanding of basic AI concepts and limitations, awareness of AI Act obligations relevant to the person's role, practical skills for the specific AI systems they operate, and knowledge of risks and potential harms. Training must account for technical knowledge, experience, and the context of AI system use.",

      "Yes. Under Art. 50(1), providers must ensure that AI systems intended to interact directly with natural persons are designed and developed so that persons are informed they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the circumstances and context of use. This means most customer service chatbots, virtual assistants, and conversational voice bots must tell users - clearly and at the start of the interaction - that they are talking to AI rather than a human. This is a limited-risk transparency obligation, not a high-risk classification. Chatbots that also generate synthetic content (e.g. AI-generated images or deep fakes) additionally trigger Art. 50(2) (machine-readable marking) and Art. 50(4) (deep fake disclosure).",

    question: "Is my spellchecker, spam filter, or recommender system subject to the EU AI Act?",
    answer:
      "For most minimal-risk AI systems - spell checkers, spam filters, product recommenders, inventory forecasting tools, dynamic pricing models, and similar - the EU AI Act imposes no specific obligations beyond the universal AI literacy requirement under Art. 4 (enforceable since 2 February 2025). Providers and deployers are encouraged to voluntarily adhere to codes of conduct under Art. 95 but are not legally required to. General product safety, consumer protection, and data protection laws still apply. The main exception is if the tool falls into Annex III (e.g. a 'recommender' that is actually used for employment screening is high-risk under Annex III(4) regardless of the label).",
