Art. 4a(1): to the extent strictly necessary to ensure bias detection and correction in high-risk AI systems in accordance with Art. 10(2)(f) and (g), providers may exceptionally process special categories of personal data, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. The safeguards sit on top of Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 and include conditions on necessity (bias detection cannot be effectively fulfilled with synthetic or anonymised data), technical limits on re-use, security and documentation, non-transmission to other parties, and deletion once the bias is corrected or the data reaches the end of its retention period. Art. 4a(2) extends the route to providers and deployers of OTHER AI systems and models and to deployers of high-risk systems, but only where processing is strictly necessary against biases likely to affect health and safety, negatively impact fundamental rights or lead to prohibited discrimination, with all paragraph-1 safeguards applied.

      "Prohibits the placing on the market, putting into service, and use of AI systems that: (a) deploy subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques materially distorting behaviour and causing significant harm; (b) exploit vulnerabilities due to age, disability, or social/economic situation; (c) perform social scoring of natural persons or groups leading to detrimental treatment in unrelated contexts or unjustified/disproportionate treatment; (d) assess risk of criminal offences based solely on profiling or personality traits; (e) create or expand facial recognition databases via untargeted scraping of internet or CCTV images; (f) infer emotions in workplaces or educational institutions (except medical or safety exceptions); (g) use biometric categorisation to infer race, political opinions, trade union membership, religion, sex life, or sexual orientation; (h) use real-time remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement (with narrow exceptions under Art. 5(2)-(4)). Points (a)-(h) applicable since 2 February 2025. The Digital Omnibus (Reg. (EU) 2026/1744) added two prohibitions applying from 2 December 2026: (ba) generating or manipulating realistic intimate or sexually explicit material of an identifiable person without their freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous and explicit consent; and (bb) generating or manipulating child sexual abuse material within the meaning of Art. 2(c) and (e) of Directive 2011/93/EU, except where a 'without right' defence applies under national law. Art. 5(1a) qualifies BOTH new points: placing on the market or putting into service is prohibited only where the generation is the intended purpose, or a reasonably foreseeable and reproducible outcome absent adequate safeguards; use is prohibited only where the deployer uses the system for that purpose. Art. 5(1b) qualifies point (ba) ONLY: manipulation that does not increase the exposure of depicted intimate parts or alter the nature of depicted sexually explicit activities does not constitute manipulation.",

The Digital Omnibus narrowed this: Art. 6(1a) excludes systems solely used for non-safety aspects of user assistance, performance optimisation, service efficiency, automation, convenience or quality control from qualifying as safety components; Art. 6(1b) pulls systems back in where failure or malfunctioning would endanger health and safety; and Art. 6(1c) provides that a third-party conformity assessment required solely for risks other than health and safety (e.g. radio spectrum or electromagnetic interference) does not fulfil the Art. 6(1)(b) condition. Art. 6(2): AI systems referred to in Annex III are also high-risk. Art. 6(3): An Annex III AI system is NOT high-risk if it does not pose a significant risk of harm to health, safety, or fundamental rights, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making. This exception applies when the system: (a) performs a narrow procedural task; (b) improves the result of a previously completed human activity; (c) detects decision-making patterns without replacing or influencing human assessment without proper review; or (d) performs a preparatory task. The exception does NOT apply if the system performs profiling of natural persons.
