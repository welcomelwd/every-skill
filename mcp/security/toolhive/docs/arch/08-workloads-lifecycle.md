# Workloads Lifecycle Management

The workloads API provides a unified interface for managing MCP server deployments across different runtimes. This document explains how workloads are created, managed, and destroyed.

## Overview

The workloads manager abstracts lifecycle operations across:
- Local Docker/Podman deployments
- Remote MCP servers
- Kubernetes deployments (via operator)

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/manager.go`

## Workload Lifecycle

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Starting: Deploy
    Starting --> Running: Success
    Starting --> Error: Failed

    Running --> Stopping: Stop
    Running --> Unhealthy: Health Failed
    Running --> Unauthenticated: Auth Failed
    Running --> AuthRetrying: Transient Token Refresh Failures
    Running --> Stopped: Container Exit

    Stopping --> Stopped: Success
    Stopped --> Starting: Restart
    Stopped --> Removing: Delete

    Unauthenticated --> Starting: Re-authenticate
    Unauthenticated --> Removing: Delete

    AuthRetrying --> Running: Refresh Succeeds
    AuthRetrying --> Unauthenticated: Ceiling Exceeded or Permanent Error

    Removing --> [*]: Success
    Error --> Starting: Restart
    Error --> Removing: Delete
```

**States**: `pkg/container/runtime/types.go`
- `starting`, `running`, `stopping`, `stopped`
- `removing`, `error`, `unhealthy`, `unauthenticated`, `auth_retrying`
- `policy_stopped`, `unknown`

The `auth_retrying` cadence and ceiling can be tuned via environment
variables on the proxy process:

- `TOOLHIVE_TOKEN_AUTH_RETRYING_TICK_INTERVAL` (default `10m`): cadence
  between background refresh attempts during the AuthRetrying window.
- `TOOLHIVE_TOKEN_AUTH_RETRYING_MAX_ELAPSED` (default `24h`): ceiling
  before the workload is finally marked `unauthenticated`.

## Core Operations

### Deploy

**Foreground:**
```bash
thv run my-server --foreground
```

Creates transport → deploys container → starts proxy → blocks until shutdown

**Detached:**
```bash
thv run my-server
```

Saves state → forks process → returns immediately → child runs in background

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/manager.go`

### Stop

```bash
thv stop my-server
```

**Container workload**: Stops proxy process → stops container → preserves state

**Remote workload**: Stops proxy → preserves state

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/manager.go`

### Start

```bash
thv start my-server
```
> Note: `thv restart` remains available as an alias for backward compatibility.

Loads state → verifies not running → starts workload with saved config

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/manager.go`

### Delete

```bash
thv rm my-server
```

**Container workload**: Stops proxy → removes container → deletes state

**Remote workload**: Stops proxy → deletes state

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/manager.go`

### Upgrade

```bash
thv upgrade check [my-server]      # offline metadata comparison, never pulls
thv upgrade apply my-server --yes  # verify + pull, then recreate
```

Upgrades apply only to **registry-sourced** workloads — those run by a registry entry name, which records `RunConfig.RegistryServerName`. A workload run from a raw image reference has no registry server name and is reported as `not-registry-sourced`.

**Check** is an offline comparison. The checker (`pkg/workloads/upgrade.Checker`) looks up the workload's `RegistryServerName` in the configured registry and compares the running image tag against the candidate the registry advertises (semver, conservative: a `latest` tag, a different repository, or non-comparable tags yield `unknown`). When the registry advertises a strictly newer tag the status is `upgrade-available`, and the result also surfaces **env-var drift** (variables the candidate now declares that the workload does not yet supply) and **posture drift** (transport, permission profile — network isolation is a local-only choice the registry cannot express, so it is not reported as drift). Checks never pull images.

**Apply** is the single security-critical path (`pkg/workloads/upgrade.Applier`). It re-derives the check against the registry on every apply (closing the time-of-check/time-of-use window — a `CheckResult` from an earlier `check` is never trusted), then, in order:

1. Resolves and **verifies** the candidate image's provenance (by registry server name).
2. Builds a merged `RunConfig` that **preserves the entire user configuration** — env vars, secrets, OIDC/authz/audit/telemetry, tool filters, middleware, transport/posture — and changes only the image, any merged env/secrets supplied via `--env`/`--secret`, and the registry source URLs.
3. Runs the policy gate and performs the verified **pull**.
4. Only then asks the manager to recreate the workload via `UpdateWorkload` (stop → delete → start with the new config).

Steps 1–3 all complete before any destruction, so a failure while preparing the candidate leaves the running workload untouched. **There is no automatic rollback**: once recreation begins, the previous image/config is not restored — recovery is a forward operation. Posture drift (transport, permission profile) is **surfaced as a warning, not converged**: the upgraded workload keeps its full existing posture, including transport, network isolation, and permission profile.

> Runtime boundary: the "verified pull before destruction" guarantee holds precisely for local container runtimes (the scope here). On Kubernetes the verification and policy gate still precede recreation, but the byte-level pull is delegated to the kubelet and happens after recreation.

The same `Applier` backs both the CLI (`thv upgrade apply`) and the API (`POST /api/v1beta/workloads/{name}/upgrade`, with `GET .../{name}/upgrade-check` and `GET .../upgrade-check` for single and bulk checks), so the verify-then-pull ordering lives in exactly one place. `thv list --check-upgrades` annotates the workload list with each workload's check result.

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/upgrade/`, `cmd/thv/app/upgrade.go`

### Proxy termination

Stop and delete terminate the proxy using its recorded PID. When PID-based termination is unavailable or fails (for example, the status file is missing, records no PID, or the process is already gone), they fall back to port-based cleanup: the process holding the proxy port is terminated only after it is confirmed to be this workload's proxy. This prevents an orphaned proxy from continuing to hold the port after the container has been stopped or removed.

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/manager.go`

### List

Listing combines container workloads from the runtime with remote workloads from persisted state. The manager can filter workloads by label or group, and can optionally include stopped workloads.

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/manager.go`

## Batch Operations

Some operations (stop, delete) support processing multiple workloads in a single invocation, handling each workload sequentially or in parallel as appropriate.

**Pattern**: Operations return a `CompletionFunc` (call to block until completion); internally uses `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup`

**Timeout**: 5 minutes per operation

## Container vs Remote

### Container Workloads

**Components:**
- Container (via runtime)
- Proxy process (detached mode)
- Permission profile
- Network isolation

**Available operations:** All

### Remote Workloads

**Components:**
- Proxy process only
- No container
- No permission profile

**Available operations:** Deploy, stop, restart, delete, list

**Detection**: `RunConfig.RemoteURL != ""`

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/manager.go`

## State Management

### Storage Locations

**RunConfig state:**
- Path: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/toolhive/runconfigs/<name>.json`
- Default: `~/.local/state/toolhive/runconfigs/<name>.json`
- Contains: Full RunConfig
- Used for: Restart, export

**Status file:**
- Path: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/toolhive/statuses/<name>.json`
- Default: `~/.local/share/toolhive/statuses/<name>.json`
- Contains: Status, PID, timestamps
- Used for: List, monitoring

**PID file** (container workloads only):
- Path: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/toolhive/pids/toolhive-<name>.pid`
- Default: `~/.local/share/toolhive/pids/toolhive-<name>.pid`
- Contains: Proxy process PID
- Used for: Stop operation

**Implementation**: `pkg/state/`, `pkg/workloads/statuses/`

### Status Manager

Provides atomic status updates:
- `SetWorkloadStatus` - Update status
- `GetWorkload` - Read status
- `SetWorkloadPID` - Set PID
- `DeleteWorkloadStatus` - Remove status

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/statuses/file_status.go`

## Labels and Filtering

### Standard Labels

The system automatically applies standard labels to workloads:
- `toolhive-name` - Full workload name
- `toolhive-basename` - Base name without timestamp
- `toolhive-transport` - Transport protocol type
- `toolhive-port` - Proxy port number

**Implementation**: `pkg/labels/`, `pkg/runner/config.go`

### Custom Labels

Users can apply custom labels for organizational purposes. Labels support filtering during list operations.

**Implementation**: `pkg/workloads/types/labels.go`
