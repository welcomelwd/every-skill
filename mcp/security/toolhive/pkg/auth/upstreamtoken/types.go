// TokenSessionIDClaimKey is the JWT claim key for the token session ID.
// This links JWT access tokens to stored upstream IDP tokens.

// UpstreamCredential bundles the access token and the ID token for a single
// upstream provider. Access tokens are refreshed when expired.
//
// The IDToken is the rotated ID token when a refresh produced one (OIDC Core
// 1.0 §12.2 permits but does not require a new id_token on refresh), otherwise
// the original JWT captured at the initial OIDC login (OIDC Core 1.0 §3.1.3.7).
// It is not independently validated for freshness.
//
// Callers that PRESENT it as a credential — e.g. as the subject_token of an
// RFC 8693 token exchange — are subject to expiry and must either check its `exp`
// claim first or handle the resulting rejection. Today's such consumer
// (pkg/vmcp/auth/strategies) deliberately takes the second option: it lets the IdP
// reject the exchange and surfaces the `invalid_grant`. Note also that the ID
// token's `aud` is this auth server's client registration with the issuing
// upstream, not the token-exchange endpoint — whether a target authorization
// server accepts it as a subject token is governed by that server's policy and
// is typically limited to the same issuer/audience.
//
// Callers that only READ ITS CLAIMS are a different case and deliberately do not
// check `exp`: the token is then evidence of what the upstream asserted at login,
// and expiry says nothing about whether that assertion happened. See
// Identity.UpstreamIDTokens for the two consumers and why they differ.
//
// IDToken may be empty when the upstream login did not return an id_token
// (e.g. the provider was not asked for the openid scope). An empty IDToken
// is a legitimate state, not an error. Note that Identity.UpstreamTokens and
// Identity.UpstreamIDTokens are projected independently and are NOT guaranteed
// to share the same key set: a provider with an access token but no ID token
// appears only in UpstreamTokens.
