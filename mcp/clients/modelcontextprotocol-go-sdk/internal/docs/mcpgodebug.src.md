# Backwards compatibility and MCPGODEBUG

 According to our compatibility promise, we can't break backward compatibility
 of the SDK API. However, sometimes we need to change the behavior of the SDK
 in a backward-incompatible way in order to fix bugs or security issues.
 In those cases we introduce temporary compatibility parameters, that can be
 used to opt-out of the new behavior. They are usually maintained for two
 minor release cycles and then removed.

 The compatibility parameters are provided via the `MCPGODEBUG` environment
 variable. The value of the variable is a comma-separated list of parameter
 value assignments, e.g.:

 ```
 MCPGODEBUG=parameter1=value1,parameter2=value2
 ```

## `MCPGODEBUG` history

### 1.8.0

Options listed below were added and will be removed in the 1.9.0 version of the SDK.

- `plaintextstatefulrejection` added. If set to `1`, a stateful
  `StreamableHTTPHandler` will respond with a plain-text `http.Error` 400 body
  when it receives a request carrying per-request metadata (i.e. an
  `io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` `_meta` field, or an
  `MCP-Protocol-Version` header >= `2026-07-28`), restoring the previous
  behavior. The default behavior was changed so that the server responds with a
  JSON-RPC error of code `CodeUnsupportedProtocolVersion` (`-32022`) carrying
  an `UnsupportedProtocolVersionData` payload that advertises the legacy
  versions the server supports. This lets the client's
  existing renegotiation logic recover and prevents the failure from tearing
  down the underlying connection.

- `blockingcancelnotify` added. If set to `1`, a cancelled call waits
  synchronously for the best-effort `notifications/cancelled` message to be
  delivered (up to `notifyCancellationTimeout`, currently 5 s) before
  returning to the caller, restoring the previous behavior. The delivery
  error is joined into the caller's returned error. The default behavior was
  changed so that the call is retired immediately and the notification is
  sent asynchronously off the caller's return path: the caller returns as
  soon as its context is cancelled and cannot be delayed by a slow or
  unresponsive peer. See issue #1150.

### 1.7.0

Options listed below were added and will be removed in the 1.9.0 version of the SDK.

- `customresnotfounderrcode` added. If set to `1`, `ResourceNotFoundError` will
  use the custom error code `-32002` instead of the standard `-32602` (Invalid
  Params), restoring the previous behavior. The default behavior was changed to
  align with SEP-2164 and the JSON-RPC specification.

- `hintomitempty` added. If set to `1`, `ToolAnnotations` JSON marshaling
  will omit `ReadOnlyHint` and `IdempotentHint` when their value is `false`,
  restoring the previous behavior. The default behavior was changed to always
  serialize these fields, since their Go types are bare `bool` (not `*bool`)
  and omitting `false` made it indistinguishable from unset.
  
- `allowsessionsinstateless` added. If set to `1`, stateless streamable HTTP
  servers will read the `Mcp-Session-Id` request header (or generate one via
  `GetSessionID`), set it on response headers, and accept `DELETE` requests,
  restoring the previous behavior. The default behavior was changed so that
  stateless servers ignore session IDs entirely and reject `DELETE` with 405.

- `nomethodnotfoundcodeinerror` added. If set to `1`, the jsonrpc2 layer will not
  include the MethodNotFound Error (`-32601`) in the error response when the 
  requested method in STDIO transport is not found. The default behavior was
  changed to include the MethodNotFound Error in the error response when the
  requested method in STDIO transport is not found.

- `noprotocolerrorbody` added. If set to `1`, the streamable HTTP client will
  not attempt to decode the JSON-RPC error body of a non-2xx HTTP response,
  and any non-transient error will permanently fail the connection, restoring
  the previous behavior. The default behavior was changed so that the client
  attempts to decode the JSON-RPC error body of a non-2xx response, surfaces
  the underlying JSON-RPC error, and wraps it with `jsonrpc2.ErrRejected` so
  that per-call rejections do not tear down the session.

- `nowrapinvalidparams` added. If set to `1`, the server will not wrap
  params-decoding failures with `jsonrpc2.ErrInvalidParams`, so wire responses
  carry the zero-value error code `0` instead of `-32602` ("invalid params"),
  restoring the previous behavior. The default behavior was changed so that
  the server always reports params-decoding failures with the standard
  `-32602` code.

- `disablecompleteparamsvalidation` added. If set to `1`, `Server.complete`
  will not validate that the required `ref` and `argument.name` fields on
  `CompleteParams` are present, restoring the previous behavior of dispatching
  the request to the completion handler unconditionally. The default behavior
  was changed to reject malformed requests with `-32602` (Invalid Params).

### 1.6.1

Options listed below were added and will be removed in the 1.8.0 version of the SDK.

- `disablecontenttypecheck` added. If set to `1`, Content-Type validation on
  HTTP POST requests will be disabled, allowing requests with non-JSON or missing
  Content-Type headers. The default behavior is to validate that HTTP POST
  requests have Content-Type: application/json.

### 1.6.0

Options listed below were added and will be removed in the 1.8.0 version of the SDK.

- `seterroroverwrite` added. If set to `1`, `SetError` will always overwrite
  `Content` with the error text, restoring the previous behavior. The default
  behavior was changed to preserve existing `Content` if it has already been
  populated.

- `enableoriginverification` added. If set to `1`, default (zero-value)
  cross-origin protection will be applied when
  `StreamableHTTPOptions.CrossOriginProtection` is nil, restoring the
  behavior from v1.4.1-v1.5.0. The default behavior was changed to not
  enable cross-origin protection.

- `disablelocalhostprotection` removal was postponed until 1.8.0, as it is now
  also used in the SSE transport.

Options below were removed:

- `jsonescaping`, according to plan,

- `disablecrossoriginprotection`, it was replaced by
  `enableoriginverification` after the default was changed to not enable
  cross-origin protection.

### 1.4.1

Options listed below will be removed in the 1.6.0 version of the SDK.

- `disablecrossoriginprotection` added. If set to `1`, newly added cross-origin
  protection will be disabled. The default behavior was changed to enable
  cross-origin protection.

### 1.4.0

Options listed below will be removed in the 1.6.0 version of the SDK.

- `jsonescaping` added. If set to `1`, JSON marshaling will preserve the previous
  behavior of escaping HTML characters in JSON strings. The default behavior
  was changed to not escape HTML characters, to be consistent with other SDKs.

- `disablelocalhostprotection` added. If set to `1`, newly added DNS rebinding
  protection will be disabled. The default behavior was changed to enable DNS rebinding
  protection. The protection can also be disabled by setting the
  `DisableLocalhostProtection` field in the `StreamableHTTPOptions` or
  `SSEOptions` struct to `true`, which is the recommended way to disable
  the protection long term. **Removal of this option was postponed until 1.8.0.**
