# Support for the MCP base protocol

%toc

## Lifecycle

The SDK provides an API for defining both MCP clients and servers, and
connecting them over various transports. When a client and server are
connected, it creates a logical session.

The MCP specification defines two lifecycle models, and the SDK supports both
transparently based on the negotiated protocol version:

- The **legacy `initialize` handshake**
  ([lifecycle](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/lifecycle))
  used by protocol versions through `2025-11-25`.
- A **stateless** model introduced in `2026-07-28` by
  [SEP-2575](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2575),
  in which there is no `initialize`/`notifications/initialized` handshake, and
  each request carries its protocol version and client capabilities in
  `_meta`. Clients SHOULD also include their identity (`clientInfo`) on every
  request, and servers SHOULD include their identity (`serverInfo`) on every
  response.

In both models, the SDK exposes the same API:

- A `Client` is a logical MCP client, configured with various
  [`ClientOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ClientOptions).
- When a client is connected to a server using
  [`Client.Connect`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#Client.Connect),
  it creates a
  [`ClientSession`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ClientSession).
  This session is initialized during the `Connect` method, and provides methods
  to communicate with the server peer.
- A `Server` is a logical MCP server, configured with various
  [`ServerOptions`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ServerOptions).
- When a server is connected to a client using
  [`Server.Connect`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#Server.Connect),
  it creates a
  [`ServerSession`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ServerSession).

In the legacy model, the server session is not considered initialized until
the client sends the `notifications/initialized` message. Use
`ServerOptions.InitializedHandler` to listen for this event, or just use the
session through various feature handlers (such as a `ToolHandler`). Requests
to the server are rejected until the client has initialized the session.

In the stateless model (`2026-07-28`+), there is no handshake. The server
processes the first request the moment it arrives, validates the per-request
`_meta` fields.

Both `ClientSession` and `ServerSession` have a `Close` method to terminate the
session, and a `Wait` method to await session termination by the peer. Typically,
it is the client's responsibility to end the session.

### Discovery (`server/discover`)

Introduced in `2026-07-28` by
[SEP-2575](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2575),
the `server/discover` RPC lets a client discover a server's supported
protocol versions, capabilities, and identity before issuing any other
request. Servers implementing `2026-07-28` MUST implement it.

- **Server**: `Server.Connect` registers the
  `server/discover` handler automatically; the response is computed from the
  server's static configuration (capabilities, server info, instructions) and
  the transport-filtered list of supported protocol versions.
- **Client**: `Client.Connect` calls `server/discover` first and
  uses the result to negotiate a mutually supported version. If discovery
  fails or the server does not support the latest version, the client falls back to the
  legacy `initialize` handshake.

### Per-request `_meta` keys

When the negotiated protocol version is `2026-07-28` or later, every request
carries these keys inside its `_meta` map (constants live in
[`mcp/protocol.go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#pkg-constants)):

| Constant | Wire key | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MetaKeyProtocolVersion` | `io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` | `string` | Yes |
| `MetaKeyClientCapabilities` | `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities` | `*ClientCapabilities` | Yes |
| `MetaKeyClientInfo` | `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientInfo` | `*Implementation` | No |
| `MetaKeyLogLevel` | `io.modelcontextprotocol/logLevel` | `LoggingLevel` (deprecated by SEP-2577) | No |

The client populates the required keys automatically on every outgoing
request, and populates `clientInfo` when configured with an `*Implementation`
(the default). Server-side handlers can read them through
`ServerRequest[P].ProtocolVersion()`, `ServerRequest[P].ClientInfo()`, and
`ServerRequest[P].ClientCapabilities()`.

### Per-response `_meta` keys

Under the same protocol version, servers SHOULD identify themselves on every
response. The SDK populates this
key automatically on every outgoing response:

| Constant | Wire key | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MetaKeyServerInfo` | `io.modelcontextprotocol/serverInfo` | `*Implementation` | No |

### Subscriptions (`subscriptions/listen`)

Introduced in `2026-07-28` by
[SEP-2575](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2575),
`subscriptions/listen` replaces the legacy `resources/subscribe` RPC and
the GET-based SSE endpoint with a single long-lived request that
multiplexes every kind of server-to-client change notification a client
opts in to. On the wire the client sends one `subscriptions/listen`
request whose `notifications` field enumerates what it wants
(`toolsListChanged`, `promptsListChanged`, `resourcesListChanged`, and/or
a list of resource URIs in `resourceSubscriptions`); the server replies
first with a `notifications/subscriptions/acknowledged` notification
reporting the honored subset, then streams every change notification on
the same request, and finally closes with a `SubscriptionsListenResult`
when it tears the subscription down.

## Transports

A
[transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports)
can be used to send JSON-RPC messages from client to server, or vice-versa.

In the SDK, this is achieved by implementing the
[`Transport`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#Transport)
interface, which creates a (logical) bidirectional stream of JSON-RPC messages.
Most transport implementations described below are specific to either the
client or server: a "client transport" is something that can be used to connect
a client to a server, and a "server transport" is something that can be used to
connect a server to a client. However, it's possible for a transport to be both
a client and server transport, such as the `InMemoryTransport` used in the
lifecycle example above.

Transports should not be reused for multiple connections: if you need to create
multiple connections, use different transports.

### Stdio Transport

In the
[`stdio`](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio)
transport clients communicate with an MCP server running in a subprocess using
newline-delimited JSON over its stdin/stdout.

**Client-side**: the client side of the `stdio` transport is implemented by
[`CommandTransport`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#CommandTransport),
which starts the a `exec.Cmd` as a subprocess and communicates over its
stdin/stdout.

**Server-side**: the server side of the `stdio` transport is implemented by
[`StdioTransport`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#StdioTransport),
which connects over the current processes `os.Stdin` and `os.Stdout`.

### Streamable Transport

The [streamable
transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http)
API is implemented across three types:

- `StreamableHTTPHandler`: an`http.Handler` that serves streamable MCP
  sessions.
- `StreamableServerTransport`: a `Transport` that implements the server side of
  the streamable transport.
- `StreamableClientTransport`: a `Transport` that implements the client side of
  the streamable transport.

To create a streamable MCP server, you create a `StreamableHTTPHandler` and
pass it an `mcp.Server`:

%include ../../mcp/streamable_example_test.go streamablehandler -

The `StreamableHTTPHandler` handles the HTTP requests and creates a new
`StreamableServerTransport` for each new session. The transport is then used to
communicate with the client.

On the client side, you create a `StreamableClientTransport` and use it to
connect to the server:

```go
transport := &mcp.StreamableClientTransport{
	Endpoint: "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
}
client := mcp.NewClient(&mcp.Implementation{Name: "client", Version: "v1.0.0"}, nil)
session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
```

The `StreamableClientTransport` handles the HTTP requests and communicates with
the server using the streamable transport protocol.

#### HTTP Headers

[SEP-2243](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2243)
standardises a small set of MCP-specific HTTP headers, sent and validated by
the SDK only for sessions negotiated on protocol version `2026-07-28` or
later.

| Header | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Mcp-Protocol-Version` | request | Mirrors `_meta.io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion` from the body |
| `Mcp-Session-Id` | request/response | Logical session identifier (removed in stateless mode) |
| `Mcp-Method` | request | Mirrors the JSON-RPC `method` field; mismatch ⇒ `-32020` |
| `Mcp-Name` | request | Mirrors the request's principal name (`tools/call.params.name`, `prompts/get.params.name`, `resources/read.params.uri`); mismatch ⇒ `-32020` |
| `Mcp-Param-{Header}` | request | Per-tool parameter passthrough; see below |

The header-name set is exhaustive: for protocol versions earlier than
`2026-07-28`, only `Mcp-Protocol-Version` and `Mcp-Session-Id` are recognised.

**Body↔header mirroring.** When `Mcp-Method` or `Mcp-Name` is present but
does not match the JSON-RPC body, the server returns
[`CodeHeaderMismatch`](#error-codes) (`-32020`). The same applies to a
mismatch between `Mcp-Protocol-Version` and the body's
`_meta.io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion`.

**`Mcp-Param-*` passthrough.** A tool may annotate properties of its
`InputSchema` with `x-mcp-header: "<HeaderName>"`. When a client invokes that
tool over HTTP, the SDK serializes the matching argument(s) as
`Mcp-Param-<HeaderName>` request headers (using `=?base64?...?=` encoding for
non-ASCII values). On the server, the headers are validated against the body
and either accepted or rejected with `-32020`. Properties so annotated must
be typed `string`, `integer`, or `boolean`; tools that fail validation at
registration time are silently dropped from `tools/list`.

#### Resumability and Redelivery

By default, the streamable server does not support [resumability or
redelivery](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#resumability-and-redelivery)
of messages, because doing so requires either a persistent storage solution or
unbounded memory usage (see also
[#580](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/issues/580)).

To enable resumability, set `StreamableHTTPOptions.EventStore` to a non-nil
value. The SDK provides a `MemoryEventStore` for testing or simple use cases;
for production use it is generally advisable to use a more sophisticated
implementation.

> **Note**: [SEP-2575](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2575)
> removes SSE stream resumability (`Last-Event-ID`, SSE event IDs) for protocol
> version `2026-07-28`. The SDK preserves the `EventStore` and `Last-Event-ID`
> code paths for backward compatibility with `2025-11-25` and earlier; on
> `2026-07-28` sessions, a broken response stream loses the in-flight request
> and the client must re-issue it as a new request with a new ID.

#### Stateless Mode

The streamable server supports a _stateless mode_ by setting
[`StreamableHTTPOptions.Stateless`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#StreamableHTTPOptions.Stateless),
which is where the server does not perform any validation of the session id,
and uses a temporary session to handle requests. In this mode, it is impossible
for the server to make client requests, as there is no way for the client's
response to reach the session.

However, it is still possible for the server to access the `ServerSession.ID`
to see the logical session

> [!WARNING]
> Stateless mode is not directly discussed in the spec, and is still being
> defined. See modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol#1364,
> modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol#1372, or
> modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol#1442 for potential refinements.

> **Required for `2026-07-28`**: the streamable HTTP transport accepts
> requests at protocol version `2026-07-28` **only** when `Stateless = true`.
> Requests at that version against a non-stateless handler are rejected.

_See [examples/server/distributed](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/blob/main/examples/server/distributed/main.go) for
an example using stateless mode to implement a server distributed across
multiple processes._

### Custom transports

The SDK supports [custom
transports](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#custom-transports)
by implementing the
[`Transport`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#Transport)
interface: a logical bidirectional stream of JSON-RPC messages.

_Full example: [examples/server/custom-transport](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/blob/main//examples/server/custom-transport/main.go)._

### Concurrency

In general, MCP offers no guarantees about concurrency semantics: if a client
or server sends a notification, the spec says nothing about when the peer
observes that notification relative to other request. However, the Go SDK
implements the following heuristics:

- If a notifying method (such as `notifications/progress` or
  `notifications/initialized`) returns, then it is guaranteed that the peer
  observes that notification before other notifications or calls from the same
  client goroutine.
- Calls (such as `tools/call`) are handled asynchronously with respect to
  each other.

See
[modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk#26](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/issues/26)
for more background.

## Authorization

### Server

To write an MCP server that performs authorization,
use [`RequireBearerToken`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#RequireBearerToken).
This function is middleware that wraps an HTTP handler, such as the one returned
by [`NewStreamableHTTPHandler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#NewStreamableHTTPHandler), to provide support for verifying bearer tokens.
The middleware function checks every request for an Authorization header with a bearer token,
and invokes the 
[`TokenVerifier`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#TokenVerifier)
 passed to `RequireBearerToken` to parse the token and perform validation.
The middleware function checks expiration and scopes (if they are provided in
[`RequireBearerTokenOptions.Scopes`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#RequireBearerTokenOptions.Scopes)), so the
`TokenVerifier` doesn't have to.
If [`RequireBearerTokenOptions.ResourceMetadataURL`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#RequireBearerTokenOptions.ResourceMetadataURL) is set and verification fails, 
the middleware function sets the WWW-Authenticate header as required by the [Protected Resource
Metadata spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728).

Server handlers, such as tool handlers, can obtain the `TokenInfo` returned by the `TokenVerifier`
from `req.Extra.TokenInfo`, where `req` is the handler's request. (For example, a
[`CallToolRequest`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#CallToolRequest).)
HTTP handlers wrapped by the `RequireBearerToken` middleware can obtain the `TokenInfo` from the context
with [`auth.TokenInfoFromContext`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#TokenInfoFromContext).

#### OAuth Protected Resource Metadata

Servers implementing OAuth 2.0 authorization should expose a protected resource metadata endpoint
as specified in [RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728). This endpoint provides
clients with information about the resource server's OAuth configuration, including which
authorization servers can be used and what scopes are supported.

The SDK provides [`ProtectedResourceMetadataHandler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#ProtectedResourceMetadataHandler)
to serve this metadata. The handler automatically sets CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
to support cross-origin client discovery, as the metadata contains only public configuration information.

Example usage:

```go
metadata := &oauthex.ProtectedResourceMetadata{
    Resource: "https://example.com/mcp",
    AuthorizationServers: []string{
        "https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    },
    ScopesSupported: []string{"read", "write"},
}
http.Handle("/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource",
    auth.ProtectedResourceMetadataHandler(metadata))
```

For more sophisticated CORS policies, wrap the handler with a CORS middleware like
[github.com/rs/cors](https://github.com/rs/cors) or [github.com/jub0bs/cors](https://github.com/jub0bs/cors).

The  [_auth middleware example_](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/tree/main/examples/server/auth-middleware) shows how to implement authorization for both JWT tokens and API keys.

### Client

Client-side authorization is supported via the
[`StreamableClientTransport.OAuthHandler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#StreamableClientTransport.OAuthHandler)
field. If the handler is provided, the transport will automatically use it to
add an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to every request. The transport
will also call the handler's `Authorize` method if the server returns
`401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` errors to perform the authorization flow
or facilitate scope step-up authorization.

The SDK implements the Authorization Code flow in
[`auth.AuthorizationCodeHandler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#AuthorizationCodeHandler).
This handler supports:

- [Client ID Metadata Documents](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#client-id-metadata-documents)
- [Pre-registered clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#preregistration)
- [Dynamic Client Registration](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#dynamic-client-registration)
- [RFC 9207](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9207) Authorization Server Issuer Identification

To use it, configure the handler and assign it to the transport:

```go
authHandler, _ := auth.NewAuthorizationCodeHandler(&auth.AuthorizationCodeHandlerConfig{
	RedirectURL: "https://myapp.com/oauth2-callback",
	// Configure one of the following:
	// ClientIDMetadataDocumentConfig: ...
	// PreregisteredClientConfig: ...
	// DynamicClientRegistrationConfig: ...
	AuthorizationCodeFetcher: func(ctx context.Context, args *auth.AuthorizationArgs) (*auth.AuthorizationResult, error) {
		// Open the args.URL in a browser and return the resulting code, state, and iss.
		// See full example in examples/auth/client/main.go.
		code := ...
		state := ...
		iss := ... // "iss" query parameter from the redirect URI (RFC 9207)
		return &auth.AuthorizationResult{Code: code, State: state, Iss: iss}, nil
	},
})

transport := &mcp.StreamableClientTransport{
	Endpoint:     "https://example.com/mcp",
	OAuthHandler: authHandler,
}
client := mcp.NewClient(&mcp.Implementation{Name: "client", Version: "v0.0.1"}, nil)
session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
```

The `auth.AuthorizationCodeHandler` automatically manages token refreshing (if the server provides a refresh token) and step-up authentication (when the server returns `insufficient_scope` error).

#### Enterprise Managed Authorization (SEP-990)

For enterprise SSO scenarios where users authenticate with an enterprise Identity Provider (IdP),
the SDK provides
[`extauth.EnterpriseHandler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth/extauth#EnterpriseHandler),
an implementation of `OAuthHandler` that automates the Enterprise Managed Authorization flow:

1. **OIDC Login**: User authenticates with enterprise IdP → ID Token
2. **Token Exchange** (RFC 8693): ID Token → ID-JAG at IdP
3. **JWT Bearer Grant** (RFC 7523): ID-JAG → Access Token at MCP Server

To use enterprise managed authorization, create an `EnterpriseHandler` and assign it to your transport:

```go
// Create ID token fetcher using OIDC login
idTokenFetcher := func(ctx context.Context) (*oauth2.Token, error) {
    oidcConfig := &extauth.OIDCLoginConfig{
        IssuerURL: "https://company.okta.com",
        Credentials: &oauthex.ClientCredentials{
            ClientID: "idp-client-id",
            ClientSecretAuth: &oauthex.ClientSecretAuth{
                ClientSecret: "idp-client-secret",
            },
        },
        RedirectURL: "http://localhost:3142",
        Scopes:      []string{"openid", "profile", "email"},
    }

    tokens, err := extauth.PerformOIDCLogin(ctx, oidcConfig, authCodeFetcher)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return tokens, nil
}

// Create Enterprise Handler
enterpriseHandler, err := extauth.NewEnterpriseHandler(&extauth.EnterpriseHandlerConfig{
    IdPIssuerURL: "https://company.okta.com",
    IdPCredentials: &oauthex.ClientCredentials{
        ClientID: "idp-client-id",
        ClientSecretAuth: &oauthex.ClientSecretAuth{
            ClientSecret: "idp-client-secret",
        },
    },
    MCPAuthServerURL: "https://auth.mcpserver.example",
    MCPResourceURI:   "https://mcp.mcpserver.example",
    MCPCredentials: &oauthex.ClientCredentials{
        ClientID: "mcp-client-id",
        ClientSecretAuth: &oauthex.ClientSecretAuth{
            ClientSecret: "mcp-client-secret",
        },
    },
    MCPScopes:      []string{"read", "write"},
    IDTokenFetcher: idTokenFetcher,
})

// Use with transport
transport := &mcp.StreamableClientTransport{
    Endpoint:     "https://example.com/mcp",
    OAuthHandler: enterpriseHandler,
}
client := mcp.NewClient(&mcp.Implementation{Name: "client", Version: "v0.0.1"}, nil)
session, err := client.Connect(ctx, transport, nil)
```

The `EnterpriseHandler` automatically manages the token exchange flow. Note that it intentionally does not support refresh tokens - when an access token expires, the entire authorization flow is repeated to ensure enterprise policies are consistently enforced.

For a complete working example, see [examples/auth/enterprise](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/tree/main/examples/auth/enterprise).

## Security

Here we discuss the mitigations described under
the MCP's [Security Best Practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/security_best_practices) section, and how we handle them.

### Confused Deputy

The [mitigation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/security_best_practices#mitigation),
obtaining user consent for dynamically registered clients, is mostly the
responsibility of the MCP Proxy server implementation. The SDK client does
generate cryptographically secure random `state` values for each authorization
request by default and validates them when the authorization code is returned.
Mismatched state values will result in an error.

### Token Passthrough

The [mitigation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/security_best_practices#mitigation-2), accepting only tokens that were issued for the server, depends on the structure
of tokens and is the responsibility of the
[`TokenVerifier`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#TokenVerifier)
provided to 
[`RequireBearerToken`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#RequireBearerToken).

### Server-Side Request Forgery

The [mitigations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/security_best_practices#mitigation-3) are as follows:

- _Enforce HTTPS_. The OAuth helpers provided by the SDK reject the `http://` URLs
except loopback addresses (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`).

- _Block Private IP Ranges_. The OAuth helpers provided by the SDK allow passing
a custom `http.Client`. Developers are advised to customize the client it with
appropriate network protections, including IP range blocking. The SDK does not provide
this capability out of the box.

- _Validate Redirect Targets_. Similarly to previous point, customized `http.Client`
can be used to validate network hops. The SDK does not provide this capability out
of the box.

- _Use Egress Proxies_. This is out of scope for the SDK and can be configured separately.

- _DNS Resolution Considerations_. The SDK has DNS rebinding protection on the server side which is enabled by default. For the client side, consider providing
a custom `http.Client` that would implement DNS pinning.

### Session Hijacking

The [mitigations](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/security_best_practices#mitigation-4) are as follows:

- _Verify all inbound requests_. The [`RequireBearerToken`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#RequireBearerToken)
middleware function will verify all HTTP requests that it receives. It is the
user's responsibility to wrap that function around all handlers in their server.

- _Secure session IDs_. This SDK generates cryptographically secure session IDs by default.
If you create your own with 
[`ServerOptions.GetSessionID`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ServerOptions.GetSessionID), it is your responsibility to ensure they are secure.
We recommend using [`crypto/rand.Text`](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/rand#Text).

- _Binding session IDs to user information_. The SDK supports this mitigation through
[`TokenInfo.UserID`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#TokenInfo.UserID).
When a [`TokenVerifier`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#TokenVerifier)
sets `UserID` on the returned `TokenInfo`, the streamable transport will:
  1. Store the user ID when a new session is created.
  2. Verify that subsequent requests to that session include a token with the same `UserID`.
  3. Reject requests with a 403 Forbidden if the user ID doesn't match.

  **Recommendation**: If your `TokenVerifier` can extract a user identifier from the token
  (such as a `sub` claim in a JWT, or a user ID associated with an API key), set
  `TokenInfo.UserID` to enable this protection. This prevents an attacker with a valid
  token from hijacking another user's session by guessing or obtaining their session ID.

### Issuer Mix-Up

The [mitigation](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9207) against issuer mix-up attacks is
implemented per [RFC 9207](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9207). The SDK client validates
the `iss` parameter in authorization responses to ensure they originated from the expected
authorization server:

- If `iss` is present in the redirect URI, the SDK verifies it matches the issuer from the
  authorization server's metadata. A mismatch results in an error.
- If `iss` is absent but the authorization server advertises
  `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported: true` in its [RFC 8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414)
  metadata, the SDK rejects the response with an error.

The `AuthorizationCodeFetcher` is responsible for extracting the `iss` query parameter from
the redirect URI and returning it in [`AuthorizationResult.Iss`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/auth#AuthorizationResult).

## Utilities

### Cancellation

Cancellation is implemented with context cancellation. Cancelling a context
used in a method on `ClientSession` or `ServerSession` will terminate the RPC
and send a "notifications/cancelled" message to the peer.

When an RPC exits due to a cancellation error, there's a guarantee that the
cancellation notification has been sent, but there's no guarantee that the
server has observed it (see [concurrency](#concurrency)).

### Ping

[Ping](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/utilities/ping)
support is symmetrical for client and server.

To initiate a ping, call
[`ClientSession.Ping`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ClientSession.Ping)
or
[`ServerSession.Ping`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ServerSession.Ping).

To have the client or server session automatically ping its peer, and close the
session if the ping fails, set
[`ClientOptions.KeepAlive`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ClientOptions.KeepAlive)
or
[`ServerOptions.KeepAlive`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ServerOptions.KeepAlive).

> **Note**: `ping` is removed from the protocol as of `2026-07-28` by
> [SEP-2575](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2575).
> The SDK preserves the API for backward compatibility with legacy clients;
> when both peers negotiate `2026-07-28`, the server returns
> `MethodNotFound` (`-32601`) for `ping` and `KeepAlive` should not be
> enabled.

### Progress

[Progress](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/utilities/progress)
reporting is possible by reading the progress token from request metadata and
calling either
[`ClientSession.NotifyProgress`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ClientSession.NotifyProgress)
or
[`ServerSession.NotifyProgress`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ServerSession.NotifyProgress).
To listen to progress notifications, set
[`ClientOptions.ProgressNotificationHandler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ClientOptions.ProgressNotificationHandler)
or
[`ServerOptions.ProgressNotificationHandler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#ServerOptions.ProgressNotificationHandler).

Issue #460 discusses some potential ergonomic improvements to this API.

### Error codes

The SDK uses the standard JSON-RPC base codes (parse error `-32700`,
invalid request `-32600`, method not found `-32601`, invalid params
`-32602`, internal error `-32603`) plus the following MCP-specific codes:

| Constant | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| [`CodeHeaderMismatch`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#CodeHeaderMismatch) | `-32020` | An MCP HTTP header (`Mcp-Method`, `Mcp-Name`, `Mcp-Protocol-Version`, or `Mcp-Param-*`) does not match the JSON-RPC body |
| [`CodeMissingRequiredClientCapabilities`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#CodeMissingRequiredClientCapabilities) | `-32021` | Server requires client capabilities the client did not declare |
| [`CodeUnsupportedProtocolVersion`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#CodeUnsupportedProtocolVersion) | `-32022` | Requested protocol version not supported. Data: `UnsupportedProtocolVersionData{Supported []string, Requested string}` |
| [`CodeResourceNotFound`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk/mcp#CodeResourceNotFound) | `-32602` | Resource URI not found (variable; was `-32002` before SEP-2164) |

The error code allocation policy defined in `2026-07-28`
([SEP-2575](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2575))
partitions the JSON-RPC server-error range:

- `-32000` to `-32019`: implementation-defined; existing SDK usage is grandfathered.
- `-32020` to `-32099`: reserved for the MCP specification.
