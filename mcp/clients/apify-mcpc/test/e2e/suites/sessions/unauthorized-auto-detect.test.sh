# Test: A crashed bearer-token session whose bridge gets a 401 on auto-reconnect
# is automatically promoted to 'unauthorized' without the user having to access
# the session first.
#
# Regression: previously, `mcpc` (the listing command) only fired-and-forgot
# the auto-restart and showed 'connecting' indefinitely until the user ran a
# command on the session, which would explicitly trigger ensureBridgeReady() and
# only then surface the auth error. The fix ensures the bridge's own status
# update (status: 'unauthorized') propagates so subsequent `mcpc` calls reflect
# reality without explicit interaction.

# Setup: produce a session in 'crashed' state with bad bearer
#
# We can't just `mcpc connect` with a bad bearer because that produces an
# 'unauthorized' status directly (showServerDetails surfaces the error during
# connect). To simulate the reported scenario — a bridge that crashed (e.g. on
# machine reboot) and now gets a 401 on its auto-restart attempt — we connect
# successfully against a temporarily-permissive server, then kill the bridge
# and edit sessions.json to look like a freshly-crashed bridge with bad creds.
