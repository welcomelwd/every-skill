# starlette-mount

Embed an MCP server inside an existing Starlette (or FastAPI) app at a
sub-path, next to your own routes. `mcp.streamable_http_app()` returns a
mountable ASGI app; the two things to get right are the **path** (the default
`streamable_http_path="/mcp"` stacks under your mount prefix) and the
**lifespan** (Starlette does not run a mounted sub-app's lifespan, so the
parent must enter `mcp.session_manager.run()`).

## Run it

```bash
# HTTP — the client self-hosts the mounted app on a free port at /api/, runs,
# then tears it down
uv run python -m stories.starlette_mount.client --http

# against a server you run yourself (real uvicorn on :8000)
uv run python -m stories.starlette_mount.server --port 8000 &
SERVER_PID=$!
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health        # → {"status":"ok"}
uv run python -m stories.starlette_mount.client --http http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
kill "$SERVER_PID"
```

## What to look at

- `client.py` `main` — opens with `async with Client(target, mode=mode) as
  client:`. Nothing on the client side knows about the mount: the `/api/` URL
  handed in as `target` is just another streamable-HTTP endpoint.
- `server.py` `streamable_http_path="/"` — without this the endpoint would be
  `/api/mcp`; with it, `Mount("/api", ...)` serves MCP at `/api/` (trailing
  slash required — Starlette's `Mount` forwards `/api` as an empty path that
  the inner `/` route won't match).
- `server.py` `lifespan` — `mcp.session_manager.run()` **must** be entered by
  the parent app. Forget it and every MCP request fails immediately with a 500
  (`RuntimeError: Task group is not initialized. Make sure to use run().`) —
  the sub-app's own lifespan never fires under `Mount`.
- `server.py` `Route("/health", ...)` — non-MCP routes live alongside the
  mount; FastAPI users do the same with `app.mount("/api", mcp_app)`.

## Caveats

- DNS-rebinding protection is on by default; the example passes
  `transport_security=NO_DNS_REBIND` because the in-process test client sends
  no `Origin` header. Remove it (or configure allowed hosts) for a real
  deployment.
- The parent-lifespan dance is a known SDK ergonomics gap (other SDKs mount
  with no extra ceremony). The recipe shown here is what works today.
