SEP-1699 server-initiated SSE disconnection with `Last-Event-ID` replay. The
server's `EventStore` stamps every SSE event with an ID and opens each response
stream with a priming event; mid-handler the tool calls
`ctx.close_sse_stream()` to release the open HTTP response (freeing a
connection slot), keeps emitting progress into the event store, and returns.
The client transport sees the stream end, reconnects with `Last-Event-ID`, and
the event store replays everything it missed — `await client.call_tool(...)`
resolves as if the disconnect never happened.

## Run it

```bash
# HTTP — the client self-hosts the app on a free port, runs, then tears it down
uv run python -m stories.sse_polling.client --http --legacy
# same, against the lowlevel-API server variant
uv run python -m stories.sse_polling.client --http --legacy --server server_lowlevel

# against a server you run yourself (real uvicorn on :8000)
uv run python -m stories.sse_polling.server --port 8000 &
SERVER_PID=$!
uv run python -m stories.sse_polling.client --http http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp --legacy
kill "$SERVER_PID"
```

## What to look at

- **`client.py` `main` — opens with `async with Client(target, mode=mode)`.**
  There is no client-side resumability configuration: the `Client` and the
  `streamable_http_client` transport handle the priming event, the SSE `retry:`
  hint, and the `Last-Event-ID` reconnect automatically. The assertion that the
  `"after-close"` progress message arrived is the proof — it was emitted while
  no SSE stream was open.
- **`server.py` — `streamable_http_app(event_store=..., retry_interval=0)`.**
  Passing an `EventStore` is what enables resumability: every SSE event gets an
  ID and the response opens with a priming event so the client always has a
  `Last-Event-ID` to reconnect with. `retry_interval=0` makes the client's
  reconnect wait a no-op (the SSE `retry:` hint).
- **`server.py` — `await ctx.close_sse_stream()`.** Ends the current request's
  SSE response without cancelling the handler. Everything emitted afterwards
  goes to the event store and is replayed on reconnect. A no-op when no
  `event_store` is configured.
- **`server_lowlevel.py` — `ctx.close_sse_stream`.** On the lowlevel API the
  callback is an optional field on `ServerRequestContext`; it is `None` unless
  an event store is wired and the negotiated version is in the 2025 era.

## Caveats

- `streamable_http_app(...)` is a hosting entry that reshapes in a later
  release; this story calls it directly because the event-store and
  retry-interval kwargs are the point.
- DNS-rebinding protection is disabled (`transport_security=NO_DNS_REBIND`)
  because the in-process httpx2 client sends no `Origin` header. Drop the kwarg
  for a real deployment.
- `event_store.py` here is example-grade only (sequential IDs, no eviction). A
  production server would back the `EventStore` interface with persistent
  storage.
