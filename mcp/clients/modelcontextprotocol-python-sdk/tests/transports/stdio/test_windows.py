"""Windows-only stdio lifecycle behaviors, against real subprocesses.

Each test pins a contract that exists only on Windows: Job-Object reaping of a
gracefully-exited server's children (the deliberate divergence from the POSIX
policy in test_posix.py), the SelectorEventLoop fallback wrapper, and the CRLF
line endings a native text-mode server emits. Synchronization is kernel-level
only (liveness sockets); see `_liveness`.

Per-test no-cover pragmas (as in tests/issues/test_552_windows_hang.py): bodies run
only on windows-latest CI legs, the per-job 100% gate would count them uncovered on
non-Windows runners, and strict-no-cover is skipped on Windows where they execute.
