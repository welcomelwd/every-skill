"""Real-subprocess stdio lifecycle tests that hold on both POSIX and Windows.

The `stdio_client` tests each launch a real server through the public API and pin
one lifecycle behaviour, with kernel-level liveness sockets as the only
synchronization; the `FallbackProcess` tests wrap a raw `subprocess.Popen`
directly. Platform-divergent shutdown policy lives in test_posix.py /
test_windows.py; the full protocol round trip is pinned by
tests/interaction/transports/test_stdio.py and in-process shutdown logic by
tests/client/test_stdio.py.
