"""`docs/deprecated.md`: the page's behavioural claims, executed against the live SDK.

This chapter has no `docs_src/` example by design: it is the one page allowed to name
the deprecated methods, and a runnable example would teach exactly what the page tells
the reader not to build. So instead of importing an example, each test here runs a
claim the page states in prose (the warning category and text, the warn-*then*-raise
order on a modern connection, the `ping` removal, and both `filterwarnings` recipes)
so the prose cannot drift away from what the SDK does.
