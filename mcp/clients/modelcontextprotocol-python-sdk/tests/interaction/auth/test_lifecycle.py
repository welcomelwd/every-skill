"""Token lifecycle, step-up, and registration-variant flows of the SDK's OAuth client.

Every test connects end to end via `connect_with_oauth`; the assertions are recording-first
(the recorded request sequence is asserted before, or independently of, the call result), so a
surprise in the refresh or step-up paths produces a readable diff of what fired rather than an
opaque failure. The provider knobs that drive each scenario are documented per test.
