"""Requirements manifest for the interaction-model test suite.

Every user-facing behaviour the SDK must satisfy, keyed by a stable `<area>:<feature>[:<variant>]`
ID. Each entry owns the tests that exercise it: tests declare `@requirement("<id>")` (a test that
proves several behaviours stacks several decorators) and `test_coverage.py` enforces the contract
in both directions: every non-deferred requirement has at least one test, and every test carries
at least one requirement.

Sources:
    spec URL    -- externally mandated by the MCP specification (deep link to the section)
    `sdk`       -- a behavioural guarantee the SDK chose; not spec-mandated
    `issue:#n`  -- regression lock-in for a previously fixed bug

The `behavior` sentence describes the REQUIRED behaviour -- what the specification (or the SDK's
own contract) says should happen. Tests always pin the SDK's current behaviour. Where current
behaviour falls short of `behavior`, the gap is recorded as data: `divergence` on entries whose
tests pin the divergent behaviour, or `deferred` on entries that are tracked but not yet covered
by a test in this suite. An entry may carry both: `divergence` records the spec-compliance gap
(issue-able) and `deferred` records why no test exists; `divergence` alone implies a test pins
the divergent behaviour. `issue` carries the tracking link for a recorded gap once one is filed.

`deferred` reasons take one of three shapes: where the behaviour is exercised elsewhere in this
repo the reason names the covering test path; where the SDK does not implement the behaviour at
all the reason starts with "Not implemented in the SDK"; and where an interaction-level test is
planned but not yet written the reason starts with "Not yet covered here".

`transports` records which transports a behaviour applies to (or is observable on); None means
the behaviour is transport-independent.

The ID vocabulary and entry granularity are aligned with the TypeScript SDK's end-to-end
requirements suite, so coverage and recorded divergences can be compared across the two SDKs
entry by entry; IDs that exist in only one SDK reflect genuinely different API surface.
