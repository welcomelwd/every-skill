"""An in-process, full-duplex HTTP transport for driving ASGI applications from httpx2.

`httpx2.ASGITransport` runs the application to completion and only then hands the buffered
response to the caller, so a server that streams its response — the streamable HTTP transport's
SSE responses — can never converse with the client mid-request: a server-initiated request
nested inside a still-open call deadlocks. `StreamingASGITransport` removes that limitation by
running the application as a background task and forwarding every `http.response.body` chunk to
the client the moment it is sent. Everything happens on the one event loop: no sockets, no
threads, no sleeps, no extra dependencies.

The behavioural contract, pinned by `test_bridge.py`:

- The request body is buffered before the application is invoked (MCP requests are small JSON
  documents); the response streams chunk by chunk.
- Closing the response — or the whole client — delivers `http.disconnect` to the application,
  exactly as a real server sees when its peer goes away.
- An exception the application raises before sending `http.response.start` fails the originating
  request with that same exception. After the response has started, a failure is visible to the
  client only through the response itself (status code, truncated body) — the same signal a real
  server over a real socket would give.

The transport owns an anyio task group for the application tasks; it is opened and closed by
`httpx2.AsyncClient`'s own context manager, so use the client as a context manager (the suite
always does). Closing the transport cancels every running application task by default; set
`cancel_on_close=False` to wait for the application's own disconnect handling instead.
