"""Contract tests for the suite's streaming ASGI bridge.

These pin what `StreamingASGITransport` itself guarantees — chunk-by-chunk delivery, disconnect
propagation, and failure handling — against minimal hand-written ASGI applications, so the MCP
transport tests built on top of it never have to wonder what the harness provides. They are
harness self-tests, not interaction-model tests, and are exempted from the requirement-coverage
contract in `test_coverage.py`.
