"""Streamable HTTP session lifecycle: creation, routing, termination, and stateless mode.

A test here speaks raw HTTP only when its assertion is the wire contract -- which header is
issued, which status code answers which condition -- that the SDK `Client` cannot observe.
Everything else is `Client`-driven against the same mounted session manager. Transport-agnostic
behaviour is covered by the `connect`-fixture matrix.
