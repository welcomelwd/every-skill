"""Resumability over the streamable HTTP transport, exercised entirely in process.

These tests configure the server with an event store, so every SSE event is stamped with an ID
and a client that loses its connection can resume by sending `Last-Event-ID`. The wire-level
tests (`mounted_app` + raw httpx2) assert exactly what travels on the wire; the end-to-end test
drives the SDK client through a server-initiated stream close and proves the call still
completes. The bridge's `aclose()` delivers `http.disconnect` to the running application, so
closing a streaming response mid-read is a deterministic in-process disconnect -- no sockets,
no real time. Every server here uses `retry_interval=0` so reconnection waits are no-ops.
