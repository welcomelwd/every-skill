"""The stdio transport: one subprocess end-to-end test and one in-process framing test.

The subprocess test proves the client-server round trip over the transport's real process
boundary; its server lives in `_stdio_server.py` and is launched via `python -m` so subprocess
coverage measurement applies. The framing test drives `stdio_server` over injected in-process
streams instead.

stdio is deliberately not a leg of the `connect`-fixture matrix: a subprocess per test would be
slow, and the matrix already proves transport-agnosticism in-process. Process-lifecycle edge
cases (terminate/kill escalation, parse errors) stay in `tests/client/test_stdio.py`.
