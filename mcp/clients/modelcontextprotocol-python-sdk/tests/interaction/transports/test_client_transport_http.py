These tests connect a real `Client` to a real server over the in-process bridge, recording every
HTTP request the SDK client issues, so the assertions are about what the transport sends (headers,
methods, ordering) rather than what the protocol layer on top of it returns. The recording is the
wire-level instrument; the SDK client never exposes these details.
