"""Regression tests for memory stream leaks in client transports.

When a connection error occurs (404, 403, ConnectError), transport context
managers must close ALL 4 memory stream ends they created. anyio memory streams
are paired but independent — closing the writer does NOT close the reader.
Unclosed stream ends emit ResourceWarning on GC, which pytest promotes to a
test failure in whatever test happens to be running when GC triggers.

These tests force GC after the transport context exits, so any leaked stream
triggers a ResourceWarning immediately and deterministically here, rather than
nondeterministically in an unrelated later test.
