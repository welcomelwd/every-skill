# Codemod Batch Test: Analysis

## Context

The MCP TypeScript SDK is migrating from a single v1 package (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) to a multi-package v2 architecture (`@modelcontextprotocol/client`, `/server`, `/core`, `/node`, `/express`). This involves renamed APIs, restructured context objects, removed modules, and
new import paths.

The `@modelcontextprotocol/codemod` package automates the mechanical parts of this migration. It runs 9 ordered AST transforms via ts-morph: import path rewrites, symbol renames, McpServer API restructuring, handler registration changes, context property remapping, and more. It
also updates `package.json` to swap v1 deps for v2.

The **batch test** runs this codemod against a curated list of real-world repos that use the v1 SDK. For each repo it:

1. Clones and installs
2. Runs baseline checks (typecheck, build, test, lint) to confirm the repo is healthy before migration
3. Runs the codemod
4. Re-installs (package.json was updated with v2 deps)
5. Re-runs the same checks

The goal is to find issues in the codemod itself — incorrect transforms, missing transforms, or gaps — so we can fix them.

## Instructions

1. Build the codemod:

    ```
    pnpm --filter @modelcontextprotocol/codemod build
    ```

2. Run the batch test:

    ```
    pnpm --filter @modelcontextprotocol/codemod batch-test
    ```

3. Read `packages/codemod/batch-test/results/*/summary.json` for the overview (there may be several config directories — one per `--sdk`/`--codemod` mode; read the run you're analyzing). Note which repos have `postCodemodClean: false` and which check types have new errors.

4. For each repo with new errors, read its `packages/codemod/batch-test/results/<config>/<repo-slug>/report.json` (the same `<config>` directory as the summary). Compare `baseline` vs `postCodemod` for each check — only errors that appear in `postCodemod` but not in `baseline`
   are codemod-introduced.

5. Also review the `codemod.diagnostics` array in each report — these are warnings the codemod itself emitted about patterns it couldn't fully handle. This applies only to local-codemod runs; when `config.codemodSource` is `published`, `codemod.diagnostics` is empty and
   `codemod.cli` holds the raw CLI output instead.

6. For each codemod-introduced error, look at the actual source file in the cloned repo (`packages/codemod/batch-test/repos/<repo-slug>/...`) to understand what the codemod produced and what it should have produced.

7. Categorize each finding using the categories below, then produce the output described in the Output Format section.

## Error Categories

| Category            | Meaning                                                                                                                            | What to do                                                                                                          |

| `manual-migration`  | The error is expected — the migration guide documents this as requiring human judgment (e.g., removed APIs, architectural changes) | Verify the codemod emitted a diagnostic for it. If not, add one.                                                    |
| `repo-specific`     | An unusual pattern unique to this repo that isn't worth handling in the codemod                                                    | Note it briefly but don't suggest codemod changes.                                                                  |
