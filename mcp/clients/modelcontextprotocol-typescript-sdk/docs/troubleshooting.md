# Troubleshooting

Each heading on this page is the verbatim error message. Match yours, then apply that entry's fix.

## `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ... is not valid JSON`

On stdio, standard output is the wire: the host parses every line your server writes to `stdout` as JSON-RPC. One `console.log` — yours or a dependency's — puts a stray line on it, and the host reports that line with this error. Log to `stderr` instead; `serveStdio` owns `stdout`, and `console.error` is safe anywhere in the process.

```ts source="../examples/guides/troubleshooting.stdio.examples.ts#serveStdio_stderr"
import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server';
import { serveStdio } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server/stdio';

serveStdio(() => {
    const server = new McpServer({ name: 'app', version: '1.0.0' });
    console.error('app server running on stdio'); // stderr — never console.log
    return server;
});
```

The host shows the `stderr` line in the server's log and keeps parsing `stdout` cleanly. [Serve over stdio](./serving/stdio.md) covers the entry point.

::: tip
The quoted token is the first character of the stray line, which usually identifies the call that wrote it.

## `TS2589: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite`

Two copies of `zod` in the dependency tree. The SDK derives its tool, prompt and resource types from Zod v4 schemas; a second `zod` copy makes TypeScript instantiate cross-version types until it hits its recursion limit and fails at an unrelated-looking call site.

List every installed copy:

```sh
npm ls zod        # or: pnpm why zod / yarn why zod
```

Align everything on one Zod 4 version. When a transitive dependency pins another copy, force one with your package manager's override field (`overrides` for npm and pnpm, `resolutions` for Yarn):

```json
{
    "overrides": {
        "zod": "^4.2.0"
    }
}
```

`npm ls zod` reporting a single version means the duplicate is gone and the error with it.

## `ReferenceError: crypto is not defined`

The OAuth client helpers sign and verify through the Web Crypto API at `globalThis.crypto`. Every `@modelcontextprotocol/*` package requires Node.js 20, where that global is always defined — this error means the process is running on an older runtime (Node.js 18 and earlier).

Upgrade Node.js. Where you cannot, assign the polyfill from `node:crypto` before anything touches the SDK:

```ts source="../examples/guides/troubleshooting.examples.ts#webcrypto_polyfill"
import { webcrypto } from 'node:crypto';

if (typeof globalThis.crypto === 'undefined') {
    globalThis.crypto = webcrypto;
}
```

With the global in place the [client OAuth](./clients/oauth.md) flows run unchanged.

## `SdkError: ERA_NEGOTIATION_FAILED`

`connect()` found no **protocol era** both sides speak, or the negotiation probe was cut short. Match the message tail:

- `the server did not offer pinned protocol version ... via server/discover (no fallback in pin mode)` — the pin names a revision the server does not offer, and pinning never falls back: drop the pin or use `'auto'`.
- `the connection closed during the server/discover probe before the server offered pinned protocol version ...` — same pin, but the server exited on the probe (an exit-on-probe legacy server): use `'auto'`.
- `the server gave no modern evidence and this client supports no pre-2026-07-28 protocol version to fall back to` — or its `the connection closed during the server/discover probe and this client supports no ...` variant — `mode: 'auto'` with a modern-only `supportedProtocolVersions` list removes the legacy fallback: restore a pre-2026 entry.
- `the connection closed during the server/discover probe (this transport probed in place — the disposable sibling probe requires the SDK's base StdioClientTransport)` — a subclass of `StdioClientTransport`, or a custom stdio-shaped transport, probed in place and met a server that exits on any pre-`initialize` request: use the base `StdioClientTransport` (which probes on a disposable sibling), or `mode: 'legacy'`.
- `the transport was closed during the server/discover probe` — the caller closed the transport while the probe was in flight; the connect aborted deliberately and the session child was never spawned.
- `Version negotiation probe failed: ...` — the probe hit a transport failure (network outage, HTTP connection drop): fix connectivity and retry.
- `the server answered the probe with HTTP 5xx` — the server or a proxy in front of it failed (mid-deploy, crashed backend); not era evidence, so no legacy fallback is attempted: retry once the deployment is healthy.

A `401`/`403` probe rejection is **not** this code — see the next section.

The pinned shape — `transport` here reaches a server still on the 2025 revisions ([Test a server](./testing.md) shows the in-memory wiring these outputs come from):

```ts source="../examples/guides/troubleshooting.examples.ts#connect_pinRejected"
const pinned = new Client({ name: 'app', version: '1.0.0' }, { versionNegotiation: { mode: { pin: '2026-07-28' } } });

try {
    await pinned.connect(transport);
} catch (error) {
    if (!(error instanceof SdkError)) throw error;
    console.log(`${error.code}: ${error.message}`);
}
```

The rejection names the pinned revision the server never offered:

```
ERA_NEGOTIATION_FAILED: Version negotiation failed: the server did not offer pinned protocol version 2026-07-28 via server/discover (no fallback in pin mode)
```

Change the mode to `'auto'`: the probe falls back to the 2025 `initialize` handshake.

```ts source="../examples/guides/troubleshooting.examples.ts#connect_autoFallback"
const negotiated = new Client({ name: 'app', version: '1.0.0' }, { versionNegotiation: { mode: 'auto' } });

await negotiated.connect(transport);
console.log(negotiated.getProtocolEra());
```

`connect()` resolves and the client reports the era it landed on:

```
legacy
```

Keep `{ pin }` where a legacy connection is unacceptable and a hard failure is the behavior you want. [Protocol versions](./protocol-versions.md) defines the eras and what each negotiation mode offers.

## `Version negotiation failed: the server requires authorization (HTTP 401)`

`SdkHttpError` with code `CLIENT_HTTP_AUTHENTICATION` (`error.status === 401`): the negotiation probe hit an auth wall and no `authProvider` is configured. Auth status is never protocol-era evidence, so `connect()` fails typed instead of guessing an era. Pass an `authProvider` — `{ token: async () => myApiKey }` for bearer tokens, or an `OAuthClientProvider` for OAuth flows (the connect-time `UnauthorizedError` → `finishAuth()` → reconnect cycle then works in every negotiation mode).

The `403` sibling — `Version negotiation failed: the server denied access (HTTP 403)`, code `CLIENT_HTTP_FORBIDDEN` — means the server refused the request outright (IP allowlist, org policy, revoked key). Fix access; this is not a protocol mismatch. (A `403` whose `WWW-Authenticate` challenge carries `error="insufficient_scope"` instead rejects with `InsufficientScopeError` — request the challenged scope.)

## `SdkError: METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_PROTOCOL_VERSION`

You sent a spec method the negotiated protocol era does not define. The SDK raises this locally — nothing reached the transport — and the message names the method, the negotiated revision, and the era-appropriate replacement.

`subscriptions/listen` exists only on a 2026-07-28 connection; this client negotiated a 2025 era, the default:

```ts source="../examples/guides/troubleshooting.examples.ts#listen_legacyConnection"
const client = new Client({ name: 'app', version: '1.0.0' });
await client.connect(transport);

try {
    await client.listen({ resourceSubscriptions: ['file:///logs/app.log'] });
} catch (error) {
    if (!(error instanceof SdkError)) throw error;
    console.log(`${error.code}: ${error.message}`);
}
```

The message carries the fix:

```
METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_PROTOCOL_VERSION: subscriptions/listen requires a 2026-07-28-era connection (negotiated: 2025-11-25). On a 2025-era connection, change notifications are delivered unsolicited: use ClientOptions.listChanged and resources/subscribe instead.
```

Either negotiate the era that defines the method — `versionNegotiation: { mode: 'auto' }` against a server that serves 2026-07-28, as in the previous entry — or call the surface the negotiated era does define. [Subscriptions](./clients/subscriptions.md) covers both delivery models; [Protocol versions](./protocol-versions.md) lists which methods each era defines.

## `Module '"@modelcontextprotocol/server"' has no exported member 'SSEServerTransport'`

`@modelcontextprotocol/server` no longer ships the server-side SSE transport, and the OAuth Authorization Server helpers (`mcpAuthRouter`, `ProxyOAuthServerProvider`) left with it. Both live on as a frozen v1 copy in `@modelcontextprotocol/server-legacy`.

Rewrite the imports:

```diff
- import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server';
+ import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server-legacy/sse';

- import { mcpAuthRouter, ProxyOAuthServerProvider } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server';
+ import { mcpAuthRouter, ProxyOAuthServerProvider } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server-legacy/auth';
```

The Resource Server helpers did not move there: `requireBearerAuth`, `mcpAuthMetadataRouter` and `OAuthTokenVerifier` are first-class in `@modelcontextprotocol/express` — see [Authorization](./serving/authorization.md). `@modelcontextprotocol/server-legacy` is frozen and receives no new features; serve new code over [Streamable HTTP](./serving/http.md), which still reaches 2025-era clients through [legacy client support](./serving/legacy-clients.md). A client limited to the HTTP+SSE transport is the one case that still needs the frozen `@modelcontextprotocol/server-legacy/sse` import above.

## `SSE stream disconnected: TypeError: terminated`

HTTP SSE streams emit a `: keepalive` comment every 15 seconds by default so client body-idle timeouts and intermediaries do not terminate an otherwise idle connection. Configure the interval with `keepAliveMs` on the transport or `createMcpHandler`; set it to `0` to disable heartbeats.

## Recap

- Every heading on this page is the exact message you searched for.
- On stdio, `stdout` carries JSON-RPC; log with `console.error`.
- `TS2589` means two `zod` copies in the dependency tree.
- The SDK raises `ERA_NEGOTIATION_FAILED` and `METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_PROTOCOL_VERSION` locally — neither is a wire error.
- Server SSE and the Authorization Server helpers live in `@modelcontextprotocol/server-legacy`.
