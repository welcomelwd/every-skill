# Behavior-surface pins

Some tests in this repo are **pins**: they assert the exact current value of a
wire- or consumer-visible behavior — an error code, a schema boundary, an
export map, the stdio env safelist — rather than checking that a feature
works. Their job is to distinguish a deliberate surface change from an
accidental one: the regular suite stays green through either; a pin goes red
through both.

## When a pin goes red on your change

A red pin does **not** mean the change is forbidden. It means the change is
surface-visible and must be deliberate:

1. Confirm the change is intended. If it isn't, the pin just caught an
   accidental break.
2. Update the pin in the same PR.
3. Add a changeset if the surface is consumer-facing.
4. Update `docs/migration/upgrade-to-v2.md` (or `docs/migration/support-2026-07-28.md` if 2026-only) where consumer-facing.

Never weaken a pin (loosen an exact match, delete an assertion) just to make
CI pass — that reopens the silent-drift hole the pin exists to close.

## Writing a new pin

- The expectation side must be a literal frozen in the test, never a value
  imported from src. Comparing a source constant against itself pins nothing.
- Mutation-check it once before landing: flip the source behavior locally and
  confirm the pin actually goes red. A pin that stays green under the drift it
  claims to guard is worse than no pin.
- Pin behavior a deployed peer or consumer can observe. Internal details that
  are invisible across the wire and the public API don't need pins.
- Don't pin a known bug to make it load-bearing — file an issue instead.

## History

The original, much broader inventory was developed against v1.x in #2258 and
#2262 (closed unmerged). This sweep ports only the boundary surfaces above;
see those PRs for the fuller exploration and the reasoning behind what was
left out.
