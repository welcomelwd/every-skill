# Protocol versions

## Name the two eras

An **era** is a behavior family, not a version string. Every protocol revision from `2024-10-07` through `2025-11-25` opens with the `initialize` handshake and shares one wire behavior — the SDK calls that family `legacy`. The `2026-07-28` revision starts the `modern` era: no `initialize`, a `server/discover` advertisement instead, and a `_meta` envelope on every request.

The SDK speaks both eras from the same `Client` and serves both from the same entry points. A connection's era is decided once, at connect time, and every difference it implies is in [the matrix below](#compare-the-eras).

## Negotiate the era from the client

`versionNegotiation` picks which handshake `connect()` performs. `mode: 'auto'` probes the server with `server/discover` and connects on whichever era it finds.

```ts source="../examples/guides/protocolVersions.examples.ts#versionNegotiation_auto"
import { Client, StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/client';

const client = new Client({ name: 'my-client', version: '1.0.0' }, { versionNegotiation: { mode: 'auto' } });

await client.connect(new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL('http://localhost:3000/mcp')));

console.log(client.getProtocolEra());
```

`http://localhost:3000/mcp` is a `createMcpHandler` server — [built below](#serve-both-eras-from-one-entry-point) — so the probe finds the 2026-07-28 era:

```
modern
```

Point the same options at a 2025-only server and `connect()` falls back to the `initialize` handshake — one extra round trip, no error (on the SDK's stdio transport the probe rides a disposable sibling process; see below).

```ts source="../examples/guides/protocolVersions.examples.ts#versionNegotiation_fallback"
const fallback = new Client({ name: 'my-client', version: '1.0.0' }, { versionNegotiation: { mode: 'auto' } });

await fallback.connect(new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL('http://localhost:4000/mcp')));

console.log(fallback.getProtocolEra());
```

`getProtocolEra()` reports the era the connection landed on; it returns `undefined` before `connect()` resolves and never changes after it.

```
legacy
```

## Pin an era

`mode` takes three values; the first is the default.

- Absent, or `mode: 'legacy'` — the 2025 `initialize` handshake, byte for byte. No probe.
- `mode: 'auto'` — probe with `server/discover`; fall back to `initialize` against a 2025-only server.
- `mode: { pin: '2026-07-28' }` — that revision or nothing. A pin never falls back.

Pin against the same 2025-only server and `connect()` rejects instead of falling back.

```ts source="../examples/guides/protocolVersions.examples.ts#versionNegotiation_pin"
import { SdkError } from '@modelcontextprotocol/client';

const pinned = new Client({ name: 'my-client', version: '1.0.0' }, { versionNegotiation: { mode: { pin: '2026-07-28' } } });

try {
    await pinned.connect(new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL('http://localhost:4000/mcp')));
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof SdkError) console.log(`${error.code}: ${error.message}`);
}
```

The rejection is a typed, local `SdkError` — nothing reaches the server beyond the probe:

```
ERA_NEGOTIATION_FAILED: Version negotiation failed: the server did not offer pinned protocol version 2026-07-28 via server/discover (no fallback in pin mode)
```

## Skip the probe with a cached verdict

`mode: 'auto'` pays the probe on every fresh connect. A host that already knows the server's era — from a registry entry, or an earlier connection's outcome — skips it by supplying `ConnectOptions.prior`, the exported `PriorDiscovery` type: `{ kind: 'modern', discover }` adopts a previously obtained `DiscoverResult` with zero round trips, and `{ kind: 'legacy' }` goes straight to the `initialize` handshake.

Freshness is the host's job, not the SDK's: a stale modern verdict fails loudly at the first request, but a stale legacy verdict succeeds silently against an upgraded server — so date cached legacy verdicts in your own storage and stop supplying them past your policy horizon. [Caching discovery verdicts](./advanced/gateway.md#caching-discovery-verdicts) shows the full loop, including the re-probe that re-populates the cache.

## Understand the probe

`probe` bounds the `server/discover` round trip that `'auto'` and a pin run before anything else.

```ts source="../examples/guides/protocolVersions.examples.ts#versionNegotiation_probe"
const cli = new Client(
    { name: 'my-client', version: '1.0.0' },
    {
        versionNegotiation: {
            mode: 'auto',
            probe: {
                timeoutMs: 10_000, // default: the connection's request timeout
                maxRetries: 0 // default: no probe re-sends after a timeout
            }
        }
    }
);
```

A probe timeout is transport-aware. On stdio a silent server is a legacy server, so `connect()` falls back to `initialize`; on HTTP silence is an outage, so `connect()` rejects with `SdkError(RequestTimeout)` instead of misreporting a dead server as legacy. One browser exception: an opaque CORS `TypeError` during the probe falls back to the legacy era, because deployed 2025 servers commonly have allow-lists that predate the 2026 headers.

Auth statuses are not era evidence either. An HTTP `401` or `403` rejecting the probe surfaces as a typed authorization failure, never the legacy fallback — and never as `EraNegotiationFailed`, so era-recovery flows keyed on that code (the [gateway guide](./advanced/gateway.md) recipe) cannot consume an auth wall. A plain `401` or `403` — with or without an `authProvider` — rejects `connect()` with an `SdkHttpError` carrying the status: code `ClientHttpAuthentication` for `401`, `ClientHttpForbidden` for `403`. One 403 shape is different: a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge with `error="insufficient_scope"` enters the Streamable HTTP transport's step-up flow regardless of provider, and with none it rejects with the flow's typed `InsufficientScopeError`. With a provider, a `401` (and a `403` `insufficient_scope` challenge) runs the auth flow first, and whatever escapes it reaches you as thrown, identity intact — the transport stamps errors at its auth seams (the `token()` read, `onUnauthorized` including custom callbacks, step-up), so `UnauthorizedError` for `finishAuth()`, the flow's typed failures (`OAuthError`, `InsufficientScopeError`, the 401-after-re-authentication diagnostic), and even an untyped crash inside a callback all propagate unchanged. A `5xx` rejecting the probe is a server failure, not era evidence: `connect()` rejects with `SdkHttpError(EraNegotiationFailed)` naming the status. These status-keyed rows read the transport's typed HTTP rejections — the SDK's Streamable HTTP transport surfaces them with the status attached; the legacy SSE client transport reports a non-2xx POST as a generic error, so over SSE a probe rejection surfaces as the generic `Version negotiation probe failed` connect error instead. Auth settles first, era second: a `401` never decides the era — the auth wall answers before the MCP layer ever sees `server/discover` — and the post-auth re-probe supplies the real era evidence.

On the SDK's own stdio transport (exactly `StdioClientTransport` — subclasses, like custom stdio-shaped transports, probe in place) the probe runs on a short-lived **sibling process** spawned from the same parameters — some stdio servers exit on any pre-`initialize` request (servers built on the official Rust SDK, rmcp, behave this way), so the probe must not spend the caller's one child process. The sibling is invisible infrastructure: its stderr is discarded and it is reaped once the era is known; the caller's transport spawns exactly once, afterwards, and its wire never carries `server/discover`. A child that exits on the probe is simply a legacy server (its exit must close the child's stdio pipes to register — an exit hidden behind a helper process holding them open falls to the probe-timeout path). Closing the caller's transport during the probe aborts `connect()` with a typed `SdkError(EraNegotiationFailed)` and the session child is never spawned. On HTTP — and on custom stdio-shaped transports, which probe in place — a mid-probe connection close rejects with the same typed error as any probe transport failure.

The client's `supportedProtocolVersions` option shapes the probe: its 2026+ entries are the versions the probe offers, and the legacy fallback stays available only while the list keeps a pre-2026 entry. A list with no pre-2026 entry removes the fallback — against a 2025-only server, `connect()` rejects with `SdkError(EraNegotiationFailed)`.

::: warning
Do not default a spawn-per-invocation CLI tool to `'auto'`. On stdio, a legacy server that never answers unknown pre-`initialize` requests stalls `connect()` for the full probe timeout before falling back, and the probe spawns an extra short-lived server process per connect. Keep the default and expose `'auto'` (or a pin) as a flag.
:::

## Serve both eras from one entry point

`createMcpHandler` is the HTTP entry that answered both clients above: it builds a fresh server per request and passes the factory the `era` that request belongs to.

```ts source="../examples/guides/protocolVersions.examples.ts#createMcpHandler_bothEras"
import { createMcpHandler, McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/server';
import * as z from 'zod/v4';

const handler = createMcpHandler(({ era }) => {
    const server = new McpServer({ name: 'forecast', version: '1.0.0' });
    server.registerTool(
        'forecast',
        {
            description: 'Forecast for a city',
            inputSchema: z.object({ city: z.string() })
        },
        async ({ city }) => ({ content: [{ type: 'text', text: `${city}: sunny (${era} era)` }] })
    );
    return server;
});
```

By default the handler also serves 2025-era traffic per request (`legacy: 'stateless'`); pass `legacy: 'reject'` to refuse it. Connect one more client with the default mode to the same URL — no probe, the 2025 handshake — and call the tool from both.

```ts source="../examples/guides/protocolVersions.examples.ts#createMcpHandler_callBothEras"
const defaultClient = new Client({ name: 'my-client', version: '1.0.0' });

await defaultClient.connect(new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(new URL('http://localhost:3000/mcp')));

for (const caller of [client, defaultClient]) {
    const result = await caller.callTool({ name: 'forecast', arguments: { city: 'Berlin' } });
    console.log(caller.getProtocolEra(), JSON.stringify(result.content));
}
```

One endpoint, one factory, two eras — and the era reached the handler:

```
modern [{"type":"text","text":"Berlin: sunny (modern era)"}]
legacy [{"type":"text","text":"Berlin: sunny (legacy era)"}]
```

On stdio, `serveStdio(factory)` from `@modelcontextprotocol/server/stdio` is the same shape per connection: the opening exchange pins the connection's era, and `legacy: 'reject'` refuses 2025 openings. [Serve legacy clients](./serving/legacy-clients.md) owns the `legacy` option and the hosting recipes for both entries.

## Compare the eras

This table is the only copy of the era differences in these docs. `getProtocolEra()` on the client and the factory's `era` on the server tell you which column you are in.

## Separate deprecation from era

Deprecation is not an era difference. `sampling`, `roots`, and the `logging` capability behind `ctx.mcpReq.log()` are deprecated as of `2026-07-28` (SEP-2577) but stay in the specification for at least twelve months; which API carries each one on a given connection is an era difference, and already has its row in the matrix above. Each deprecated surface opens its own page with a sunset banner naming the migration target; nothing in the matrix moves when a deprecation lands.

## Link here instead of explaining inline

Era differences live on this page and nowhere else. Every other page in these docs spends at most one sentence on an era and links here; do the same in your own server's documentation.

> The wire encoding of structured results differs by protocol era — see [Protocol versions](./protocol-versions.md).

## Recap

- An era is a behavior family: `legacy` covers `2024-10-07` through `2025-11-25`, `modern` starts at `2026-07-28`.
- `versionNegotiation` picks the client handshake; the default is the unchanged 2025 `initialize`, no probe.
- `mode: 'auto'` probes with `server/discover` and falls back to `initialize`; a pin never falls back and rejects with `SdkError(EraNegotiationFailed)`.
- `getProtocolEra()` reports the negotiated era on the client; the `createMcpHandler` / `serveStdio` factory receives the `era` it is about to serve.
- The behavior matrix on this page is the only copy; every other page links here in one line.
- Deprecation (SEP-2577) is not an era difference.
