/**
 * Machine-readable reasons a requirement is excluded from the createMcpHandler

 * reason's entries are the cells to re-admit. (Requirement families that the
 * per-request entry structurally cannot serve at all — server→client requests,
 * sessions/resumability, standalone GET streams, subscriptions — are already
 * expressed through their existing `transports` restrictions and never reach
 * the entry arms, so they need no annotation here.)
 *
 * - `requires-session` — needs a persistent connected server instance (or
 *   connection-level message delivery beyond one request/response exchange);
 *   the entry's modern path serves every request with a fresh instance.
 * - `method-not-in-modern-registry` — drives a method the 2026-07-28 registry
 *   deletes (ping, logging/setLevel, resources/subscribe,
 *   notifications/roots/list_changed, …); meaningful only for `entryModern`.
 * - `asserts-legacy-handshake` — asserts initialize/initialized handshake or
 *   initialize-based version-negotiation mechanics; the modern path negotiates
 *   via server/discover and never sends initialize, so the body would assert
 *   vacuously or fail. Meaningful only for `entryModern`.
 * - `legacy-only-vocabulary` — asserts wire vocabulary or advertisement flags
 *   the 2026-07-28 surface deliberately deletes or omits (tools[].execution,
 *   listChanged/subscribe capability flags on server/discover). Meaningful
 *   only for `entryModern`.
 * - `modern-error-surface` — asserts the 2025-era client-facing error surface
 *   (ProtocolError with the wire code) for dispatch-window errors; on the
 *   modern per-request path those errors ride mapped HTTP statuses and the
 *   client currently surfaces them as SdkHttpError (see the coverage report's
 *   GAPS FOUND). Meaningful only for `entryModern`.
 * - `drives-transport-directly` — the body builds and drives its own transport
 *   or hosting instead of the wired pair, so an entry cell would duplicate an
 *   existing cell without exercising the entry.
