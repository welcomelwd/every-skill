/**
 * Fires a form-mode elicitation that surfaces a sign-in nudge in the client UI
 * when the backend has signaled (via `X-Context7-Auth-Prompt: 1`, captured on
 * `ctx.shouldPrompt` in api.ts) that the anonymous caller should be prompted
 * to authenticate.
 *
 * The message is delivered out-of-band to the human via the client, not into
 * the tool result the LLM reads, so it does not trip prompt-injection guards.
 *
 * The backend owns how often this fires: it sets the header at most once per
 * MCP session, so the server holds no suppression state — it simply shows the
 * dialog whenever the header is present. The command itself is shown in the
 * dialog message for the user to copy; the server does not attempt to drive
 * the client to run it.
 *
 * No-op for authenticated callers, when the signal wasn't set, or when the
 * client did not advertise the `elicitation` capability. Fire-and-forget:
 * never blocks or fails the surrounding tool response.
 *
 * 2025-era stdio only, by design. The 2026-07-28 protocol revision removed
 * the push-style server-to-client request channel, and its replacement —
 * returning `inputRequired(...)` from the tool handler — would replace the
 * tool result and force a client retry, i.e. gate doc delivery behind the
 * nudge. That trade is wrong for a soft hint, so modern-era connections get
 * no nudge: `getClientCapabilities()` is undefined there (no initialize
 * handshake), so the capability guard below short-circuits. On HTTP the guard
 * short-circuits for the same reason — each stateless request runs on a fresh
 * server that never saw an initialize.
