/**
 * Headless-browser MCP Apps smoke for the prod web client (#1859).
 *
 * `smoke:web:browser` proves the bundle boots and paints its first frame. It
 * stops there — it never connects to a server, so everything downstream of the
 * connect (the Apps tab, the sandbox controller, the UI-protocol bridge) is
 * unexercised by any smoke. This closes that gap: it drives the full
 * **connect → open app → widget ready** chain against a real MCP App server.
 *
 * The assertion is the `data-app-status="ready"` contract documented in
 * clients/web/README.md ("MCP Apps screen automation contract"): the renderer
 * only reports `ready` once the widget has loaded inside the sandbox iframe and
 * fired `notifications/initialized` back through the bridge. So a single
 * attribute covers the whole path — sandbox controller serving the proxy page,
 * the proxy loading the UI resource, and the bridge completing its handshake.
 *
 * ── What this does and does NOT catch ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This runs against the **repo build tree**, like every other `smoke:*`. That
 * matters for the bug that motivated it: #1859 was a *packaging* failure —
 * `clients/web/static/sandbox_proxy.html` was missing from the published
 * tarball's "files" allowlist. In the repo that file is always present, so this
 * smoke would have stayed green through that entire bug.
 *
 * The packaging dimension is owned by `npm run pack:verify`, which asserts the
 * file both in the tarball packlist and on disk after a real install. Keep both:
 * pack:verify proves the file *ships*, this proves the App path *works*. Neither
 * subsumes the other, and the failure this one is positioned to catch is a
 * regression in the sandbox/bridge code itself — which pack:verify, driving only
 * `GET /`, would not notice.
 *
 * As a cheap extra, this does assert the proxy page exists at the location the
 * runtime resolves it from (`clients/web/build/../static/…`, see
 * server/sandbox-controller.ts) — which catches the file being *moved or
 * renamed* without its reader being updated, a repo-tree failure pack:verify
 * would only find later.
 *
 * Playwright is resolved with a `createRequire` based at clients/web/package.json
 * rather than a bare `import("playwright")` — a bare ESM specifier resolves
 * relative to scripts/, not the cwd, so `cd clients/web` in the npm script would
 * NOT make it resolvable. Same gotcha as smoke:web:browser; see its header.
 *
 * Expects `clients/web/dist` and `clients/launcher/build` to be built first —
 * the validate / CI ordering guarantees this. `test-servers/build` is built on
 * demand if missing, as in smoke:cli.
