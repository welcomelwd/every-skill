/**
 * Boot smoke test for the prod TUI launcher path (#1347).
 *
 * `npm run smoke:launcher` only checks `--tui --help`; it never actually starts
 * the Ink app, so the launcher → TUI → core path and `--catalog` loading went
 * unverified by the launcher smokes. This script launches the built launcher in
 * `--tui` mode against a temp `--catalog`, waits for the app to render its first
 * frame (the "MCP Servers" panel) within a timeout, then sends SIGTERM and
 * exits.
 *
 * It asserts the TUI *boots and renders* without crashing — not full
 * interaction (driving an Ink UI deterministically in CI is flaky, so this is
 * intentionally a shallow render check). Exits non-zero on a crash-before-render
 * or a render timeout.
 *
 * Expects `clients/launcher/build` and `clients/tui/build` to be built first
 * (the validate / CI ordering guarantees this). The bundled stdio test server
 * (`test-servers/build`) is built on demand here if missing.
