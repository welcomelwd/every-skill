// End-to-end tests for the dep-lockstep guard's executable path (Copilot,
// #1962). The sibling tests cover the pure helpers; nothing exercised `main()`,
// so a regression in source enumeration, install discovery, lockfile loading,
// the sibling-guard vouch, or the nonzero exit on real skew would have left the
// whole suite green.
//
// Each case builds a throwaway repo — the guard derives its root from its own
// file location, so the script is copied into the fixture rather than pointed
// at one — `git add`s it (the enumeration is `git ls-files`, which reads the
// index), and runs the guard as a subprocess to assert the exit status and
// message. Run via `npm run test:scripts`.
