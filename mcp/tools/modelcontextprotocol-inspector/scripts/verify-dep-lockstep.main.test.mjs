// End-to-end tests for the dep-lockstep guard's executable path (Copilot,
// #1962). The sibling tests cover the pure helpers; nothing exercised `main()`,
// so a regression in candidate derivation, install discovery, lockfile loading,
// the sibling-guard vouch, or the nonzero exit on real skew would have left the
// whole suite green.
//
// Each case builds a throwaway repo — the guard derives its root from its own
// file location, so the script is copied into the fixture rather than pointed
// at one — `git add`s it (install discovery is by manifest, but the sibling
// `verify:format-coverage` vouch and git-based tooling expect a repo), and runs
// the guard as a subprocess to assert the exit status and message.
//
// Since #1965 the fixture must contain a REAL tsc program: the candidate set is
// derived from what `tsc --listFilesOnly` resolves, so each fixture ships two
// installs holding the same tiny stub packages, one client tsconfig whose
// program spans both (its own `src` resolves from the client install, the shared
// `core/` it includes resolves from the root — the actual v2 shape), and a
// symlinked real `typescript` to run it. Run via `npm run test:scripts`.
