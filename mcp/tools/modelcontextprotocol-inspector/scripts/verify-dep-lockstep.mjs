// Durable guard for the "one version per install-crossing dependency" invariant
// (#1896). v2 is not an npm workspace: the root and each `clients/*` carry their
// own `node_modules`, so the *same* package can resolve to two different
// versions in one process — or, worse, in one `tsc` program.
//
// That second case is what this guard exists for. A client's
// `tsconfig.test.json` compiles first-party sources that live *outside* the
// client (`test-servers/src`, `core/`), and those files resolve their
// dependencies from the **root** install while the client's own sources resolve
// from the client install. When the two copies are the same version the
// duplication is harmless; when they skew, TypeScript must relate two
// structurally-distinct declarations of the same type.
//
// For most packages that is merely redundant work. For a deeply
// recursive-generic type surface it is exponential: zod `4.3.6` (root) against
// zod `4.4.3` (clients/web) made `tsc -b` in `clients/web` exhaust the 4GB
// default heap outright (`FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap
// limit`) via `TS2589 Type instantiation is excessively deep`, because every
// `@modelcontextprotocol/*` schema is built out of zod generics. Aligning the
// two copies — changing nothing else — returned the build to its baseline cost.
//
// The candidate set is DERIVED, not hand-listed: it is the packages imported by
// the shared first-party TypeScript — `core/`, `test-servers/src`, and the
// root-owned `vitest.shared.mts` — the surfaces compiled into more than one
// client's program. Skew is then denied by default, with a small
// allowlist of packages verified to tolerate it (below). A dependency that
// starts skewing therefore fails `validate` and forces a decision, rather than
// surfacing months later as an unexplained OOM.
//
// KNOWN BOUNDARY (#1965): the candidate set covers packages the shared sources
// name *directly*. A package whose declarations reach the program only through
// another package's `.d.ts` is invisible here — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is
// the live example, skewed root 1.29.0 vs `clients/web` 1.30.0 and present in
// web's program from both installs, yet never written in first-party code
// (the shared sources import the split `@modelcontextprotocol/client|core|…`).
// Two derivations were measured for closing this. A lockfile dependency
// closure is unusable — 155 packages, 25 of them skewed, nearly all irrelevant
// tooling (`chai`, `qs`, `iconv-lite`) — and it misses the SDK anyway. Reading
// what actually lands in each program (`tsc --listFilesOnly`, keeping packages
// present under two install roots) is both correct and small: 15 for
// `clients/web`, ~10 once nested duplicates are dropped. That is the right
// derivation and is tracked separately, since it changes what the guard
// measures and surfaces skews needing their own decisions.
