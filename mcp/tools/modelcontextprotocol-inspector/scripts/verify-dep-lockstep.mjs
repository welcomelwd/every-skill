// Durable guard for the "one version per install-crossing dependency" invariant
// (#1896). v2 is not an npm workspace: the root and each `clients/*` carry their
// own `node_modules`, so the *same* package can resolve to two different
// versions in one process — or, worse, in one `tsc` program.
//
// That second case is what this guard exists for. A client's
// `tsconfig.test.json` compiles first-party sources that live *outside* the
// client (`test-servers/src`, `core/`), and those files resolve their
// dependencies from the **root** install while the client's own sources resolve
// from the client install. When the two copies are the same version the
// duplication is harmless; when they skew, TypeScript must relate two
// structurally-distinct declarations of the same type.
//
// For most packages that is merely redundant work. For a deeply
// recursive-generic type surface it is exponential: zod `4.3.6` (root) against
// zod `4.4.3` (clients/web) made `tsc -b` in `clients/web` exhaust the 4GB
// default heap outright (`FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap
// limit`) via `TS2589 Type instantiation is excessively deep`, because every
// `@modelcontextprotocol/*` schema is built out of zod generics. Aligning the
// two copies — changing nothing else — returned the build to its baseline cost.
//
// The candidate set is DERIVED from what actually enters each `tsc` program
// (#1965): every client tsconfig project is listed with `tsc --listFilesOnly`
// (the shared `lib/tsc-program.mjs` machinery `verify:typecheck-coverage` reads
// too), each resolved `node_modules` file is mapped to its owning install and
// package, and a package that reaches ONE program from TWO installs is a
// candidate. That is exactly the set that can put two structurally-distinct
// copies of a type in front of one type checker — no more, no less.
//
// It replaced a derivation that read the packages the shared sources named
// *directly*, which could not see a package whose declarations arrive only
// through another package's `.d.ts`. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` was the live
// example: it is never written in first-party code (the shared sources import
// the split `@modelcontextprotocol/client|core|…`), yet 16 of its `.d.ts` files
// land in `clients/web`'s test program, so a second copy under
// `clients/web/node_modules` would have skewed unseen. The other derivation
// measured for #1965 — expanding the direct imports over the lockfiles'
// `dependencies` — was unusable: 155 packages, 25 of them skewed, nearly all
// irrelevant transitive tooling (`chai`, `qs`, `iconv-lite`), and it missed the
// SDK anyway.
//
// Skew among the candidates is then denied by default, with an allowlist of
// packages verified to tolerate it (below). A dependency that starts skewing
// fails `validate` and forces a decision, rather than surfacing months later as
// an unexplained OOM.

// Packages whose cross-install skew is verified benign, each with the reason.
// This is an allowlist of *names*, not of version pairs, so an ordinary patch
// float within one of these does not churn the file — while any package NOT
// listed here failing the check is a genuine, unreviewed new skew.
//
// Being listed is NOT a blanket exemption: it tolerates skew only *within a
// major version*. A rationale establishes that a patch/minor difference is
// harmless, which is not evidence that a React 18-vs-19 or Hono 4-vs-5 split
// across installs would be — that is a different type surface, and it fails like
// anything else (Copilot, #1962).
//
// The admission test is the one the zod incident established: does the
// package's public type surface consist of deeply recursive generics that
// first-party code relates across the boundary? If yes it must stay in
// lockstep; if no, a patch-level difference costs nothing.
//
// **Empty today**, and that is a consequence of the #1965 derivation rather than
// a relaxation. The four former entries were all admitted under the old
// direct-import derivation, which asked only "is this name written in shared
// source and held at two versions somewhere" — a question two installs can
// answer yes to without any program ever seeing both copies:
//
//   • `jose` and `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` are declared only at the root
//     since #1970, so neither can skew at all now.
//   • `react` ships no types of its own, so what lands in a program is
//     `@types/react`, and it lands from a single install; the `react` package's
//     own files never enter one. `hono` likewise resolves from one install per
//     program (`clients/web` in web's node project).
//
// If any of them ever does reach one program from two installs, the guard fails
// and forces the decision then — with the actual version pair in hand, which is
// a better basis for a rationale than a pre-emptive entry.
