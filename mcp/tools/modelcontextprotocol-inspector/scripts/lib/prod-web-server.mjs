 * `scripts/smoke-web.mjs` (serves-the-HTML check), `scripts/smoke-web-browser.mjs`
 * (runs-the-bundle check, #1615), and `scripts/smoke-web-app.mjs` (MCP Apps
 * end-to-end, #1859) all boot the *same* prod `mcp-inspector --web` server, so the
 * spawn + readiness-poll boilerplate lives here once instead of being copy-pasted

 * reason — it is a property every web smoke needs, not one script's concern.
 *
 * Repo-root paths are derived from import.meta.url, so a caller's cwd (e.g.
 * `smoke:web:browser` does `cd clients/web` first so its `npx playwright
 * install` finds the local bin) doesn't affect which launcher/build tree runs.

/**
 * Spawn `mcp-inspector --web` (prod, no `--dev`) against the built

 * The server always runs against a **throwaway catalog**, never the developer's
 * real `~/.mcp-inspector/mcp.json` (#1977). Without `MCP_CATALOG_PATH` the web
 * backend falls back to that default writable catalog, which made these smokes
 * both destructive and non-deterministic: `smoke:web:app`'s deep link persists a
 * `deep-link` server row, so a second run finds it already on disk. The row is
 * then racing hydration — the deep-link effect misses it in `servers`, POSTs
 * `addServer` anyway, and the backend answers 409. The app swallows that 409 by
 * design so the smoke still passes, but it reports a spurious non-fatal console
 * error that is really just residue from the previous run. Isolating the catalog
 * makes every run look like the first one, and mirrors `smoke:cli` / `smoke:tui`,
 * which have always driven a temp `--catalog`.
 *
 * Only the catalog is redirected. Other per-user state under `~/.mcp-inspector`
 * (OAuth tokens, the `storage/` dir) is still shared — isolating that means
 * redirecting HOME wholesale, which these smokes deliberately do not do, since
 * HOME also resolves the npx and Playwright caches they depend on.
