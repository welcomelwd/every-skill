// Shared resolver for spawning a package's CLI cross-platform (#1939).
//
// On Windows, `npx`/`npm` are `.cmd` shims, not executables — a shell-free
// `execFileSync`/`spawnSync` cannot start one (Node refuses `.cmd`/`.bat`
// spawns without `shell: true` since the CVE-2024-27980 hardening) and throws
// `ENOENT`. GitHub CI runs Linux, so the gate stayed green there while being
// unrunnable for any Windows contributor. Instead of shelling through `npx`,
// resolve the JS entry behind the package's bin and run it with
// `process.execPath`: cross-platform, shell-free (no quoting hazards), faster
// (no npx resolution), and pinned to the locally installed package exactly as
// `npx --no-install` was.

import { createRequire } from "node:module";
import path from "node:path";

/**
 * Absolute path of the JS entry behind a package's bin (e.g. typescript's
 * `tsc`, vite's `vite`), resolved from `fromDir` up the node_modules tree —
 * the same walk `npx --no-install` does, minus the `.cmd` shim a shell-free
 * spawn can't start on Windows. Reads the package's manifest and takes the
 * path out of its `bin` field (what npx itself does) rather than resolving the
 * bin path directly, because an `exports` map blocks deep resolution — Vite 8
 * doesn't export `./bin/vite.js`, so `require.resolve("vite/bin/vite.js")`
 * throws `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.
 *
 * Throws if the package isn't installed from `fromDir`, declares no such bin,
 * or declares one whose file is missing — the caller decides whether that's a
 * hard "cannot measure" error or a fallback.

/**
 * The package's own `package.json`, found by walking the same `node_modules`
 * chain Node's resolver would from `fromDir` — deliberately NOT via
 * `require.resolve("<pkg>/package.json")`.
 *
 * That shortcut reads as safe and isn't: subpath resolution is governed by the
 * package's `exports`, and a package may declare one that omits `./package.json`
 * (Node dropped its special case for it, so there is no guaranteed export). Such
 * a package throws `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` here even though its bin is
 * installed and perfectly spawnable — a false "not installed" that would send
 * someone to `npm install` for a package already on disk. `resolve.paths()`
 * gives the search dirs without consulting `exports` at all.
 *
 * Its list is then filtered to the `node_modules` directories on `fromDir`'s
 * own ancestor chain, because `resolve.paths()` also appends Node's GLOBAL
 * FOLDERS (`$HOME/.node_modules`, `$HOME/.node_libraries`, `$PREFIX/lib/node`)
 * and any `NODE_PATH` entries. Accepting those would quietly break the
 * guarantee this module exists to keep — that the spawned tsc/vite is the
 * REPO-PINNED one, exactly as `npx --no-install` promised. A missing repo
 * install would then find a globally installed TypeScript and measure the
 * programs with the wrong compiler, instead of failing with the actionable
 * "run npm install" this helper is supposed to produce.
