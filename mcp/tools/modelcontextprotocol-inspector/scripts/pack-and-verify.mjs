/**
 * Pack-and-verify: build the exact tarball npm would publish, install it into a
 * clean throwaway consumer, and drive the real `mcp-inspector` bin against that
 * installed package — web, cli, and tui (#1636).
 *
 * Why this exists, and why the `smoke:*` scripts aren't enough: the smokes run
 * against the in-repo build tree (`clients/<name>/build`, `clients/web/dist`) via the
 * launcher's relative paths. That tree is NOT the published package. We have
 * repeatedly been bitten by things that work in `--dev` / in-repo yet break for
 * a real consumer running `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector …`, because:
 *
 *   - the `files` allowlist (root + each nested client `package.json`) silently
 *     omits something the runtime needs (this is exactly how `clients/web/build`
 *     was missing from the tarball while `clients/web/dist` slipped through);
 *   - path resolution that is correct relative to the repo differs once the code
 *     lives under `node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/inspector/…`;
 *   - the `postinstall` client-install cascade misbehaves for an end user.
 *
 * This script closes that gap by exercising the package the way npm publishes
 * and a user installs it, end to end. It:
 *
 *   1. builds every client (`npm run build`);
 *   2. packs the publishable tarball (`npm pack`) and inspects its file list —
 *      asserting NO source maps ship and that `clients/web/{build,dist,static}`
 *      are all present (the packaging fixes this work landed);
 *   3. installs that tarball into a fresh temp dir (real `npm install <tgz>`,
 *      which runs the package's `postinstall`);
 *   4. runs the installed `mcp-inspector` bin: `--help`, `--cli`/`--tui` help
 *      dispatch, a real `--cli` `tools/list` over stdio, and a prod `--web` boot
 *      that must serve `/` (HTTP 200) with the injected auth-token global from
 *      the shipped `dist` — all from the INSTALLED location, not the repo.
 *
 * Exits non-zero on the first failure. Requires network access (step 3 pulls the
 * package's runtime dependencies from the registry) — it is a local / release
 * verification tool, not part of the fast `validate` loop.
 *
 * Usage: `npm run pack:verify` (from the repo root).
