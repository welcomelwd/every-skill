/**
 * Verifies the browser-externalized-builtin build gate (#1769).
 *
 * The gate (clients/web/vite.config.ts +
 * clients/web/server/browser-externalized-builtin-gate.ts) fails `vite build`
 * when a Node built-in reaches the browser graph — Vite 8 otherwise only warns
 * and ships a `{}` stub, so the broken bundle builds green. The unit tests cover
 * the detection logic against a *captured* message string; only a real build can
 * prove the gate still fires against the *live* Vite version, catching the one
 * risk the issue calls out: the warning phrasing drifts across Vite releases
 * (8.0.x → 8.1.x), silently disabling a message-keyed gate.
 *
 * This temporarily injects a `node:fs` import into the browser entry
 * (src/main.tsx), runs `vite build`, and asserts the build FAILS with the #1769
 * error, then restores the entry. Run from `npm run ci`.
 *
 * Why the REAL config + entry (and not a fast throwaway temp entry / generated
 * config): building the actual `clients/web` config is what catches config-level
 * regressions — the plugin being deleted from the `plugins` array, its
 * `applyToEnvironment` no longer matching the browser environment's name, or a
 * `build.rollupOptions.onwarn` suppression added above it. A temp config would
 * keep passing through all of those, degrading this from "the gate works in this
 * repo" to "the gate's string still matches the live Vite." That fidelity is the
 * point, and it's why this accepts a full (~minute) app build and a
 * source-mutation-with-restore rather than something cheaper. Do NOT "optimize"
 * it into a temp entry — that silently loses the config-regression coverage.
