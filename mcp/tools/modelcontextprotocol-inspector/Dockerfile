# build/ output, so there is nothing to build here.

# Run as the non-root `node` user the base image ships. The inspector resolves
# its runtime-state dir (default catalog, OAuth token storage) from `HOME`

# home and work from there.
ENV HOME=/home/node

# volume's ownership from the image's directory at the mount point — and when
# that directory does not exist it creates it `root:root`, which the non-root
# `node` user then cannot write. Without this, `-v inspector-data:/home/node/.mcp-inspector`
# (the recipe for keeping your saved servers across `docker run --rm`) makes
# every "add server" fail with `EACCES ... open '/home/node/.mcp-inspector/mcp.json.tmp-*'`.
