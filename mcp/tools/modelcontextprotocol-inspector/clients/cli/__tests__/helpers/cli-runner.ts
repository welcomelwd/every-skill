 * instrumentation. The previous implementation spawned `build/index.js` as a
 * subprocess, which left CLI source invisible to coverage (#1484).
 *
 * The returned shape matches the old out-of-process runner exactly
 * (`exitCode` / `stdout` / `stderr` / `output`) so every existing test and the
 * shared assertion helpers keep working unchanged:
 * - stdout/stderr are captured by temporarily patching `process.std*.write`
 *   (which also captures `console.error`/`console.warn`, since those route
 *   through `process.stderr.write`).
 * - A thrown error (bad args, failed connect, unsupported method) maps to
 *   `exitCode: 1` with the message appended to stderr — mirroring how the real
 *   binary (`index.ts`) routes errors through `handleError` → `process.exit(1)`.
 * - `options.env` is applied to `process.env` for the duration of the call and
 *   fully restored afterward.
 *
 * The real binary, its shebang, and actual `process.exit` codes are covered by
 * the thin out-of-process layer in `e2e.test.ts` and `scripts/smoke-cli.mjs`.
 *
 * DO NOT drive `--help` / `--version` through this runner. `cli.ts` sets
 * `program.exitOverride((err) => { if (err.exitCode !== 0) throw err })`, so for
 * those (exitCode 0) commander does NOT throw — it falls through to its normal
 * `process.exit(0)`, which run in-process would terminate the vitest worker.
 * Cover `--help` / `--version` in the out-of-process `e2e.test.ts` layer instead.
