// wait entirely). `liveArmedContainers` holds the containers this test rendered
// and did NOT unmount itself — the `afterEach` asserts each is still connected
// (a still-mounted tree that got detached means `cleanup()` ran too early). A
// test's own `unmount()` removes its container from the set (its detach is

//
// Two config assumptions this module-level state depends on:
//   1. **Sequential tests.** It isn't concurrency-safe, so don't use
//      `renderWithMantineTransitions` under `test.concurrent` /
//      `describe.concurrent` (two in-flight tests would share this arming).
//   2. **`isolate: true`** (Vitest's default; nothing in vite.config.ts
//      overrides it). The `afterEach` below is registered when this module is
//      first evaluated during a test file's collection, so isolation — a fresh
//      module registry per file — is what re-registers it for every file. Under
//      `isolate: false` the module evaluates once per worker, so the hook binds
//      to only the first importing file; other files then arm with no hook to
//      consume it — the drain silently never runs (reopening #1760/#1786 with no
//      guard trip) and this state leaks across files. Confirmed by probe:
//      `vitest --no-isolate --pool=threads --no-file-parallelism` over two
//      real-transitions files leaves one file's arming unconsumed. If isolation
//      is ever disabled, move arming to `onTestFinished` inside
//      `renderWithMantineTransitions` (per-test, immune to module caching) — but
//      mind that its ordering vs `setup.ts`'s `cleanup()` must be re-established.

// failing frame is an rAF callback executing *after* teardown, so the precise

// continuation) isn't pinned down. The fix doesn't depend on which: awaiting a
// real timer inside `act` drains the queued rAF callbacks, the terminal
// `setTimeout`, and the React work they schedule against the still-mounted tree
// — whichever is the actual escapee, it resolves on a live component before
// cleanup unmounts. Because it awaits a *real* `setTimeout`, it deadlocks under
// fake timers, so guard against that with a clear message rather than a 5s

// catches it detaching the tree concurrently while this hook awaits. The
// pre-check runs synchronously *before* the await, so it structurally can't
// observe a mid-settle detach — that's why the post-check exists. That
// concurrent case additionally needs the unit project's `sequence.hooks` set to
// "parallel" (same-level hooks run sequentially under "stack"/"list", so they
// can't overlap this hook's await). Neither fires in the current outer-cleanup
