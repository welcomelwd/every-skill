// registers it through Vitest's mock APIs — this project doesn't set
// `restoreMocks` globally, so a test that mutates `globalThis.fetch` directly

// `theme.respectReducedMotion` is true, and Mantine 8 defaults it to `false`
// (the project theme doesn't override it). The actual protection against the

// claimed. `env` is read only by `Transition.mjs`, and only at its *render*
// branch (`transitionDuration === 0 || env === "test"`); `useTransition()` is
// called before that check, since hooks cannot be conditional, so it still
// schedules real `window.setTimeout`s on every `mounted` change. Measured:

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Leaked-timer safety net (#1984)
//
// A `window.setTimeout` that outlives its test file fires after happy-dom has
// disposed that file's `window`, and React's `dispatchSetState` then throws an
// uncaught `ReferenceError: window is not defined`. Vitest attributes that to
// whichever file happened to be running, and one such error fails the ENTIRE
// run with every test passing — so it reads as a defect in an innocent file.
//
// Mantine's own hooks do clear their timers on unmount (`useTransition`'s
// `clearAllTimeouts`, `useLockScroll`'s effect cleanup), so this is not a
// library bug. It is a race: `clearAllTimeouts` cancels the *pending* rAF, but
// if that rAF callback is already in flight when the unmount lands,
// `cancelAnimationFrame` is a no-op and the callback goes on to schedule a
// `setTimeout` after cleanup has already run. Nothing owns that timer. It needs
// a loaded machine to hit, which is why it only ever appears in CI.
//
// Rather than chase each component, track every timer *and every animation
// frame*, and clear whatever is still outstanding once the test's own teardown
// has had its turn. Ordering is load-bearing twice over: this runs *after*
// `cleanup()` below, so legitimate unmount cleanups clear their own timers and
// only true leaks are left; and frames are cancelled *before* timers are swept,
// because a queued frame callback would otherwise run after the sweep and
// register a fresh timer. See the ordering note on the `afterEach` itself.
//
// Under `vi.useFakeTimers()` the wrapper is swapped out for vitest's fake
// implementation, so nothing is tracked while fake timers are installed — which
// is correct, since a fake timer cannot outlive the environment.
// Handles are held as `unknown`, deliberately. The DOM lib declares these as
// `number`, but happy-dom returns objects at runtime — verified here:
// `setTimeout` yields a `Timeout` and `requestAnimationFrame` an `Immediate`.
// An earlier revision typed the sets `Set<number>` and guarded removal with
// `typeof id === "number"`; that guard never matched, so explicitly-cleared
// timers were never untracked. Harmless in effect (the teardown sweep clears
// them again and `clearTimeout` is idempotent) but the bookkeeping was a
// fiction, and the test asserting it passed vacuously. Treat the handle as
// opaque and pass it straight back to the matching canceller.
