// Under happy-dom (no server) those real requests 404 and log alarming
// `GET .../api/config 404 (Not Found)` lines that make a green run look broken.
// Returning an empty 200 keeps such *incidental* calls quiet. Tests that care
// about fetch install their own per-test spy/stub (e.g. `vi.spyOn(globalThis,
// "fetch")`), which Vitest only auto-reverts to this baseline if the test
// registers it through Vitest's mock APIs — this project doesn't set
// `restoreMocks` globally, so a test that mutates `globalThis.fetch` directly
// must restore it itself. Note the tradeoff: this default is permissive, so a
// test meaning to assert on a fetch FAILURE must set up its own rejecting/
// erroring stub rather than relying on the absence of a server.

// disable Mantine transitions: `useTransition` only honors reduced motion when
// `theme.respectReducedMotion` is true, and Mantine 8 defaults it to `false`
// (the project theme doesn't override it). The actual protection against the
// #1760 post-teardown `window is not defined` leak is `env="test"` in
