/**
 * Regression coverage for #1797: a server may talk to us the instant it is
 * initialized, and the Inspector must already be able to answer.
 *
 * The client advertises `roots` (and sampling/elicitation/tasks) on the SDK
 * `Client` at construction, so from the moment `connect()` sends
 * `notifications/initialized` the server is entitled to call `roots/list`.
 * `server-filesystem` does exactly that — it learns its allowed directories that
 * way — and used to get `-32601 Method not found` because the handlers were
 * registered after the handshake had already resolved.
 *
 * Driving this over a real HTTP server would make the assertion a race (the
 * outcome depends on whether the server's request lands before or after the
 * post-connect awaits). The fake transport below removes the timing entirely: it
 * delivers the server→client traffic synchronously from inside the `send()` of
 * `notifications/initialized`, i.e. at the earliest instant any server could.
 *
 * `tasks/list` rides along with `roots/list` so the assertion pins the whole
 * pre-handshake registration block rather than one member of it — moving any of
 * it back after `connect()` fails here. (`sampling/createMessage` and
 * `elicitation/create` are deliberately left out: they park a pending request
 * awaiting user input, so they have no reply to assert on.)
 *
 * The `roots/list_changed` notification is injected too, covering the sibling
 * `registerPeerNotificationHandlers()`. Note the spec sends that notification
 * the *other* way (client→server), so the inbound handler is defensive rather
 * than something a conformant server exercises — this pins where it is
 * registered, not a behaviour real servers depend on.
 *
 * One case never connects at all: it covers the constructor's `cleanRoots`
 * normalization — same #1797 thread, since answering `roots/list` promptly is
 * only useful if what we answer with is well-formed.
 *
 * The teardown cases cover the flip side of the same move. Registering the
 * handlers before the handshake also widened the window in which a server can
 * queue a request with us, so every path that ends a connection has to clear
 * that queue, announce it, and settle each entry — otherwise the web
 * pending-request modal outlives the connection it belongs to, and the server
 * is left waiting on a request we accepted and never answered. There are three: a
 * failed `connect()`, a mid-session transport close, and an explicit
 * `disconnect()`. `disconnect()` and the crash path clear before dispatching
 * `disconnect`, so a handler reading the queue sees it empty. `connect()`'s
 * own catch dispatches no `disconnect` — though on a real transport its
 * `dropCachedTransport()` usually fires `onclose` first, which clears,
 * announces and *does* dispatch one, so the catch's own call is really the
 * backstop for the auth-recovery sub-case, where the transport is retained and
 * no `onclose` fires. The crash and failure paths emit the change events
 * immediately; `disconnect()` batches them with its other teardown dispatches.
 *
 * The outbound direction needs settling too, on its own terms. The raw-wire
 * modern `tasks/*` map is ours — the SDK's era gate keeps those frames out of
 * its own `_responseHandlers`, so its teardown can't settle them — and a
 * Tasks-tab poll in flight when the server dies would otherwise wait out its
 * own 30s timeout and blame the timeout for a crash. It is rejected on the two
 * paths that can hold one, `disconnect()` and the crash path; the `connect()`
 * catch needs no such call, because nothing populates the map before the
 * handshake and both terminal paths clear it.
 *
 * Both directions carry the same caveat, and it is covered for each: those
 * paths are every way *out*, which is not every way *in*. An `onerror` without
 * an `onclose` only flips the status — it runs none of them, and leaves the
 * transport cached for the next `connect()` to reuse — so the queue and the
 * raw-wire map are swept start-clean at the top of `connect()` as well. The
 * end-clean clears stay where they are regardless: a consumer handling the
 * `disconnect` event has to see them already empty, which a sweep on the way
 * back in cannot provide.
 *
 * A further category is session scoping. Receiver tasks, resource
 * subscriptions, cancelled task ids, paused task-input aborts and the modern
 * log-level opt-in are all scoped to one connection — `tasks/list` is answered
 * from that map, and a stale subscription makes the modern subscribe a silent
 * no-op — so they belong to the session that created them. Note the contrast
 * with the teardown cases above: the peer-request queue is cleared end-clean,
 * because its emptiness has to be observable from the `disconnect` event, and
 * only swept on the way in as a backstop; this has no such consumer, so it is
 * *reset* start-clean at the top of `connect()` and nowhere else — a crash, or
 * a failed connect the caller retries on the same instance, means ending a
 * session is not the only way a new one begins.
 * Reset, not cleared: the log level is re-derived from the server setting
 * rather than dropped, so a mid-session override does not carry over and the
 * configured level is not lost. The same category covers a release obligation,
 * not just a misread one: the reset must close what it drops, since a
 * `connect()` reusing a transport an `onerror` left up can be holding the last
 * reference to a live stream. That release is best-effort in both directions —
 * it is also covered that a `close()` failing either way, synchronously or by
 * rejecting, does not escape into the straight-line teardown around the reset's
 * other caller, `disconnect()`, whose remaining steps most callers would never
 * see skipped.
 *
 * Some cases cover the other side of the registration gates. Client capabilities
 * are fixed at construction, so each gate must key off what was actually
 * advertised rather than the option it was derived from: a later `setRoots()`
 * must not make a subsequent `connect()` register a roots handler that was
 * never advertised, and an `elicit` option that enables no mode must not
 * register an elicitation handler. Either mistake throws before the handshake,
 * so the client cannot connect at all.
 *
 * A note on the ordering, since two axes describe this file equally well and
 * they cut differently: the cases are grouped by *route* — everything the
 * `onerror`-then-reconnect route has to settle sits together, rather than each
 * collection sitting with its own category. Where a case is the counterpart of
 * one in another group, it is placed next to its counterpart (the two halves of
 * the stream-release obligation, one per route) rather than with its route.
 *
 * The converse category is the advertised capability object itself: it must
 * only invite requests we actually serve, and so must the notifications we
 * emit. `capabilities.tasks.requests` names the server→client requests we
 * accept as tasks, so it is built from the sampling/elicitation capabilities
 * rather than from `receiverTasks` alone; and a `roots/list_changed` is an
 * invitation to re-read roots, so it is withheld on a client that never
 * advertised the capability (the SDK refuses it too — the guard only avoids
 * provoking that rejection). Otherwise a server takes an invitation we answer
 * `-32601` on, which is where this whole thread started.
