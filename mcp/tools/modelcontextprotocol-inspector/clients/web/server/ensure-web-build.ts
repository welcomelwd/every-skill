/**
 * Ensure the production web assets exist before the Hono server tries to serve
 * them (#1486).
 *
 * `mcp-inspector --web` (prod, no `--dev`) serves static files from
 * `clients/web/dist/`, which only exists after a build. In the published package
 * `dist/` always ships, so this is a no-op there. In a fresh dev checkout the
 * directory is absent and the prod path would otherwise serve a broken page
 * (`ENOENT` on `index.html`). When the build is missing we build it once, on
 * demand; if that build can't run (e.g. dev dependencies are absent, as in a
 * stripped published install) we throw an actionable error instead of letting
 * the server come up and serve a broken page.
