// Fail `vite build` when a Node built-in lands in the browser bundle (#1769).
// Vite 8 otherwise only *warns* and ships a `module.exports = {}` stub, so a
// broken bundle builds green; the runtime browser smoke (`smoke:web:browser`,
// #1615) only catches the subset where that stub is *called* at module init.
// The detection + error logic lives in `browser-externalized-builtin-gate.ts`
// (Vite-agnostic, unit-tested); this is only the Vite wiring.
//
// Throwing directly in `onLog` does NOT abort a rolldown build (it's the one
// hook where a thrown error is swallowed — verified against vite@8.0.0), so the
// gate *records* the warning in `onLog` and re-throws in `buildEnd`, which runs
// after module resolution (by when the warning has fired) and where a throw
// aborts the build with a non-zero exit.
//
// `apply: 'build'` scopes it to `vite build` (never `vite dev` or the vitest
// projects), and `applyToEnvironment` narrows it to the **browser** (`client`)
// environment so a future SSR/node environment built from this config isn't
// failed for a legitimate `node:*` import — the browser-only intent is
// structural, not incidental. (The Node runner build is a separate tsup config.)
//
// `buildStart` resets the gate so a `vite build --watch` rebuild doesn't inherit
// a prior build's recorded warnings (the plugin instance is reused across
// rebuilds). `buildEnd` only asserts on the *success* path: rolldown also calls
// `buildEnd(error)` when the build already failed for another reason, and
// throwing then would mask that real error with the #1769 message.
