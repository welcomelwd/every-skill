// react-hooks is registered for the two classic rules the Ink components were
// written against (rules-of-hooks + exhaustive-deps, which the source already
// references in inline disable directives). We deliberately do NOT pull in the
// full react-hooks@7 "recommended" set: its newer error-level rules (e.g.
// set-state-in-effect) flag long-standing, intentional patterns in the
// component/hook surface that is itself the interim-excluded one tracked in
// #1501. Enforcing them would require refactoring code out of scope here.
