/**
 * Bundling invariant for the TUI's React-rendering dependencies (#1952).
 *
 * The published TUI is a single ESM bundle whose bare `import "react"` resolves
 * from `clients/tui/build/`. Any package left *external* resolves its own
 * `react` from wherever npm placed **it** instead — and npm places a package
 * next to a version satisfying its declared peer range. `ink-form` and
 * `ink-scroll-view` accept `react: ">=18"`, so a consumer project holding React
 * 18 satisfies them, they hoist to that project's root, and the Inspector's
 * React 19 nests beneath it. Two React copies later, the first hook either of
 * them calls reads a null dispatcher and the TUI dies with
 * "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" — the moment a tool
 * test form or a scroll view mounts.
 *
 * Inlining them removes npm from the decision entirely: their `import "react"`
 * is emitted into the bundle, so it resolves exactly where the bundle's does.
 *
 * This test is the durable guard, because the failure is invisible in the repo
 * (a dev install has one React) and in every smoke (same) — it only appears
 * once the package is installed *under* another project that renders React.
