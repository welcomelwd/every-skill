 *
 * - `resetSubscriptionStream` — fire-and-forget (`void`), and the last statement
 *   of the method. Because this helper is `async`, even a synchronous throw
 *   becomes a rejection of the promise it returns, which the `void` then drops:
 *   the caller is unaffected, and the harm is an *unhandled rejection* — fatal
 *   to a Node process by default, a console error in the browser. That, not
 *   skipped teardown, is what the wrapping buys at this site.
 * - `refreshModernSubscription`'s re-listen close — awaited, with the
 *   replacement `listen()` after it, so an escaping failure skips the re-listen
 *   and leaves a non-empty subscription set with no stream. On the reconnect
 *   caller it is instead absorbed into the backoff run and retried.
 * - the superseded-generation discard — awaited, but `return` follows, so
 *   nothing local is skipped; the failure only propagates out of
 *   `refreshModernSubscription` to whichever caller a newer refresh had already
 *   superseded. Self-healing on the reconnect path; on the two user-initiated
 *   paths it is a report of a failure that did not happen — for
 *   `unsubscribeFromResource`, whose removal is kept regardless, a "Failed to
 *   unsubscribe" for an unsubscribe that stuck. Both of those gate their
 *   failure handling on still owning the re-listen, so a superseded call
 *   reports its error without editing a filter or a badge that is no longer
 *   its own (see `subscribeToResource`'s catch for the reasoning).
 *
 * Note what the generation bump proves in that last case is that a newer
 * refresh had *started*, not that it succeeded — it may yet fail at its own
 * `listen()`, making an escaping failure here a second one rather than a
 * redundant one.
