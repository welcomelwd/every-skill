   * Settle a still-pending sample as cancelled, without removing it from the

   * serves every route that drops the queue wholesale — each route out of a
   * connection, and the top of `connect()` as a backstop for the one route in
   * that settles nothing. The category, not a count: that set has grown.
   *
   * Unlike an elicitation there is no internal awaiter to unblock, but on the
   * plain server-request shape the *server* is one: we accepted its
   * `sampling/createMessage`, so dropping the request without settling means no
   * response frame is ever written and it waits forever. That is reachable when
   * the transport outlives the failed attempt — `connect()` keeps it when an
   * auth provider holds it open — so settle rather than discard. Rejecting is
   * the right settle: it is what the UI's decline path sends, and the SDK turns
   * it into a JSON-RPC error response. No-op once already resolved.
   *
   * A *task-augmented* sample sits in the same queue but already answered the
   * wire request synchronously with a `CreateTaskResult`, so nothing is waiting
   * on a frame; settling there is about not leaving the task in
   * `input_required` limbo. Its reject reaches the receiver task's payload
   * promise, which `InspectorClient` marks handled at creation for exactly this
   * reason.
   *
   * Deliberately does not call `onRemove`, for the same reason as
   * `ElicitationCreateMessage.cancel()`: the caller iterates the queue and
   * clears it itself, so removing here would splice mid-iteration — skipping
   * every other entry and leaving those requests unanswered.
