## Development setup

v2 is **not** an npm workspace — each client under `clients/*` keeps its own `package.json` and `node_modules` (see the rationale in [specification/v2_cli_tui_launcher.md](specification/v2_cli_tui_launcher.md)). A single `npm install` at the repo root is still all you need: the root `postinstall` (`scripts/install-clients.mjs`) cascades `npm install` into `clients/web`, `clients/cli`, `clients/tui`, and `clients/launcher`.

- **Fresh clone / first-time setup:** run `npm install` at the repo root.
- **After a pull that changes a client's dependencies:** re-run `npm install` at the root to re-sync every client (the `postinstall` cascade handles it).
- The cascade is dev-only: it exits early when the package is installed under `node_modules`, and the published tarball ships only each client's `build/`, so end users are unaffected. Set `INSPECTOR_SKIP_CLIENT_INSTALL=1` to skip it.

After installing, `npm run build` builds all clients. The launcher scripts (`npm run web` / `web:dev`) run the built launcher, so build first; for day-to-day web iteration use `cd clients/web && npm run dev`.

## Dependency placement

**The MCP SDK packages — `@modelcontextprotocol/client`, `core`, `server`, `server-legacy`, `ext-apps` — are declared in the repo-root `package.json` and nowhere else.** Do not add them to a `clients/*/package.json`: Node resolution walks up, so the root install already serves every client, and a per-client declaration installs a *second copy* that drifts from the root's. That drift is not theoretical — it put two versions of `ext-apps` (1.7.4 / 1.7.5), and of the transitive v1 `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (1.29.0 / 1.30.0), in the tree at once (#1970), and a second copy of `client`/`core` is exactly the failure the `dedupe` + `server.deps.inline` workaround in `vitest.shared.mts` exists for.

The same **placement** rule covers anything reached only through **root-owned code that has no manifest of its own** (`test-servers/src`, `core/`): declare it at the root, and alias it to the **repo root** in `vitest.shared.mts` rather than to `<client>/node_modules` like that file's other pins. `express` and `yaml` are the two today — both reached through `test-servers/src` (express by the http/oauth servers, yaml by `load-config.ts`).

**Placement and classification are separate questions.** Which *section* of the root manifest it goes in follows from who consumes it at runtime:

- A package `core/` imports at runtime belongs in root **`dependencies`**. The client builds bundle `core/` but externalize npm packages, so a published install resolves them from the root manifest — and devDependencies are not installed for consumers, so a runtime import parked there breaks the published package while passing every local check.
- A package only the tests, the test servers, or the build tooling need belongs in **`devDependencies`** — `express`, added there by #1970.
- `yaml` is in `dependencies` today even though its only importer is `test-servers/src/load-config.ts`. Left as-is deliberately (moving it changes what ships, which is not a docs change); if you touch it, confirm no published path reads YAML first.

**A dependency that renders React components must be bundled into the client that uses it, and is then not a root dependency.** An externalized package resolves its own `react` from wherever npm placed **it** in the consumer's tree, and npm places a package beside a React satisfying *that package's* peer range — looser than ours in every case here, which is all it takes to split React. `ink-form` and `ink-scroll-view` declare `">=18"`, satisfied by a consumer's React 18 while our React 19 nests underneath: the bundle renders through one React, those packages call hooks on another, and the TUI crashes on the first hook (#1952). Both are inlined by `clients/tui/tsup.config.ts` (`noExternal`) and declared only in `clients/tui/package.json`, where the build resolves them — declaring an inlined package at the root would just make consumers install a second, unused copy.

**`ink` is the single exemption, and it is justified by cost, not by safety.** Bundling it works but adds ~1.4MB (`react-reconciler` + `yoga-layout`, plus a `createRequire` banner, since inlined CJS calls `require` at runtime and esbuild's ESM interop rejects that without a real `require` in scope). **Never justify an exemption by a peer range** — `ink` briefly carried "its `">=19"` peer keeps npm honest", which is false: a consumer pinning React 19.0 satisfies `">=19"` while a narrower range of ours nests underneath. What actually makes the exemption safe is a *different* lever: the **root `react` range stays open to the whole major (`^19.0.0`)**, so npm can dedupe our React with whatever React 19 a consumer pins and an external `ink` lands on the same copy the bundle uses. Narrowing it (e.g. back to `^19.2.4`) silently reopens the crash for the renderer itself, which breaks TUI *startup*, not just its forms. `clients/tui/__tests__/tsupConfig.test.ts` enforces all of it: React-rendering deps inlined, each exempt package both external and root-declared, and the root range pinned to `ink`'s peer floor.

The v1 SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) is **not** a dependency of this repo and must not become one — v2 uses the packages above. It appears in the lock files only as a `"peer": true` entry pulled in by `ext-apps`.

## Contributing

External contributions are accepted as **issues, not pull requests** — maintainers handle design and implementation through a prompt-driven workflow.
If you've already built a change locally, share the **prompt** you used and screenshots if applicable, not a diff. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full policy.

**This applies to org members with write access too, not just outside contributors.** Having permission to push a branch is not authorization to open a PR. Pull requests against this repo are opened by the **repo maintainers** only. Anyone else — including organization members whose write access makes it technically possible — opens a **detailed issue** instead, and a maintainer takes it from there. A detailed issue means: the problem, how to reproduce it, the behavior you expected, and — if you've already prototyped a fix — the prompt you used and any screenshots, rather than a diff.

**Issues are filed through the forms in [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) — blank issues are disabled.** GitHub serves the chooser from the **default branch** only, so a form edited here on `v2/main` has no effect on the live chooser until the next milestone merge into `main` — and it cannot be previewed before then, which is why the schema notes below matter. There are two forms, **Bug report** (`1-bug_report.yml`, auto-labels `bug`) and **Feature request** (`2-feature_request.yml`, auto-labels `enhancement` **and `v2`**); `config.yml` holds the chooser's contact links. A form's `labels:` is **static** — GitHub cannot map a reporter's answer to a label — which splits the two cases: the **bug** form could target either line, so it carries a required version-line _dropdown_ and a maintainer applies the matching label at triage per [Label by version](#issue-driven-work-style); the **feature** form is v2 by construction (v1 takes security fixes only and cannot receive a feature), so it needs no dropdown and declares `v2` statically. If v1 ever reopens to features, that static label is what has to change. **There is deliberately no security template**: a vulnerability report must not open a public issue, so the chooser routes it to the private advisory form as a contact link instead (see [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md)). When adding or changing a form, validate it against GitHub's issue-forms schema (`markdown` blocks take no `id` and no `validations`; `checkboxes` mark `required` per option, not under `validations`).

**Every PR must reference an issue. No exceptions, regardless of who opens it.** The PR body's first line is `Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>` (see the [Issue-driven Work Style](#issue-driven-work-style) rules below). A PR with no linked issue has no board card, so the work is invisible to the project board and untracked — if you're about to open one and there's no issue yet, create the issue first. This holds for a maintainer's own one-line fix as much as for a feature.

## Project Status and Direction

- The v1/main branch currently contains the legacy version of the Inspector, which we are creating security fixes for in deprecated maintenance mode. It is **published straight from the branch** to the `v1-latest` npm dist-tag — v1 releases never pass through `main`, and v1 PRs therefore target `v1/main` directly.

- The v2/main branch currently contains the the new version of the Inspector, which is actively being developed and maintained. All new features, bug fixes, and refactors should be implemented in this branch. It acts as the **develop branch**: work accumulates here continuously and is merged into `main` at milestone releases.

- The main branch is the default branch for the repo, and it currently points to the latest v2 release. It is not a development branch, and no new features or bug fixes should be implemented here. It is only used for releases of the v2 Inspector via merge from v2/main, which is what publishes the `latest` npm dist-tag.

## Maintenance Rules

### Keep documentation files up to date

- When adding, removing, renaming, or changing the purpose of any file or folder, update the corresponding entry in the main README.md and/or the related clients/*/README.md
- When the structure of the project, the tech stack, or the developer setup changes, update appropriate README.md files with the details.
- When adding new commands, dependencies, or architectural patterns, update the relevant sections of appropriate README.md files as well.
- When rules for implementation and testing change, update this file AGENTS.md
- **Mirror review-relevant changes into [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md).** That file is what GitHub Copilot reads when it reviews a PR, and it is a hand-maintained **distillation** of this one — there is no generation step and nothing detects drift, so it goes stale silently and Copilot then reviews against rules we no longer hold.
  - **AGENTS.md remains the source of truth.** Never edit `copilot-instructions.md` alone to change a rule; change it here first, then mirror.
  - **Review-relevant** means anything a reviewer would cite against a diff: the TypeScript rules, the Mantine/React conventions (including the `.withProps()` rule and its exceptions), the `lib` vs `utils` split, test placement, the ≥90% coverage gate and the `v8 ignore` policy, the `renderWithMantine` requirement, and the PR hygiene rules (`Closes #N`, version label). Changing any of these means updating both files in the **same PR**.
  - **Not review-relevant, and deliberately absent** from the mirror: the board recipes and their IDs, milestone and branch-naming mechanics, release and publishing procedure, and the project-structure tree. Copying those in would double the maintenance surface for content no reviewer cites.
  - Keep it a **distillation, not a copy** — it is read on every review, so length has a cost. Prefer tightening the summary over pasting a section wholesale.

### Issue-driven Work Style

All work should be driven by items on the project board.

> **A v2 issue _you_ create is not "created" until it is labeled `v2` **and** typed (`bug`/`enhancement`/`documentation`/`chore`/`question`), given a milestone, AND on board #28 with a Status _and_ a Priority set.** Labeling alone is not enough — a label is a repo tag, the milestone is a release bucket, and the board is a separate org project. Applying `--label v2` does **not** add the item to the board, and adding it to the board does **not** set a Status or a Priority. All five are distinct steps; do all five (see the recipes below). **Only issues go on the board — never PRs.** A PR still gets the `v2` label, but it is tracked through its linked issue's card (via `Closes #N`), not its own board item.
>
> **This describes an issue created through the flow below — not every issue that appears in the repo.** An issue opened by hand, in the GitHub UI, arrives with no label, no milestone, and no card. That is true of an outside reporter's (they have no board access) _and_ of a maintainer's (write access makes the board reachable, not automatic). Either way it is normal on arrival, not a defect to fix the moment it lands; it comes into the system through [triage](#triaging-unboarded-issues) instead. The two paths differ in exactly one thing: doing the create flow _is_ the approval, so the issue starts in **Todo** with a milestone; an issue that arrives unboarded and unmilestoned has been approved by nobody, so it starts in **Incoming** with no milestone.

- Before starting work, check the board for the relevant item.
- **Every board item is a real GitHub issue.** Do not create draft items (board cards with no issue number). If you find work that needs tracking, create an actual issue and add that to the board. Before creating a new issue, check the board for a matching item to avoid duplicates — **never create a duplicate**.
- **Label by version — every issue and every PR, no exceptions.** Each one carries **exactly one** of `v1` or `v2` at creation. There is no unlabeled state and no "decide later": an issue with neither label belongs to no version line, appears in no version-filtered query, and is effectively invisible.
  - `v1` — work targeting `v1/main` (the deprecated line: security fixes only)
  - `v2` — work targeting `v2/main` (active development; the default for anything new)
    Set the label at **create time** — `gh issue create --label v2 ...`, `gh pr create --label v2 ...` — never by backfilling later, since unlabeled items are exactly the ones missed when filtering by version. **If the target version isn't obvious, it's `v2`**: v2 is where all new work goes, and `v1` is reserved for the narrow case of patching the deprecated line. Only ask when the issue is specifically a fix _for released v1 behavior_ and it's unclear whether v2 still has the bug. Note the label is a repo tag and is **not** the board — see the callout above; a `v2` issue also needs a board card with a Status **and** a Priority (a `v1` one needs a Status; board #11 has no Priority field).
- **Label by type — every issue you create or triage carries exactly one of `bug` / `enhancement` / `documentation` / `chore` / `question`.** The version label says _which line_ the work belongs to; the type label says _what kind of work it is_, and the two are independent — every issue needs both. Set it at create time (`gh issue create --label v2 --label bug ...`) or, for one arriving through [triage](#triaging-unboarded-issues), in the same pass that applies the version label.

  | Type | Use for | Not for |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `bug` | Something is broken, wrong, or regressed against its intended behavior | A missing capability that was never built |
  | `enhancement` | A new capability, or extending an existing one — features, spec support, tracking issues for either | A cleanup with no behavior change |
  | `documentation` | Prose deliverables — READMEs, guides, `specification/` docs, `AGENTS.md` rules | Code that happens to need a doc update |
  | `chore` | Maintenance with no user-facing behavior change — dependency work, build/CI tooling, refactors, cleanup | Anything a user would notice |
  | `question` | An open question or discussion with no agreed deliverable yet | Work someone has already decided to do |

  **Don't force the binary.** `bug` and `enhancement` are the two most reached for, and pressing a docs task or a dependency pin into `enhancement` degrades it to "not a bug" — at which point filtering by it stops telling you anything. If an issue is really a migration guide, say `documentation`; if it is a `tsup` → `tsdown` migration, say `chore`.

  A **PR** does not need a type label — it is classified through the issue it closes, the same way it is tracked through that issue's board card.
- **Prioritize every board item.** Every issue must have a Priority (Urgent, High, Medium, or Low) on its card — set when the card is created, whether that's at issue-creation time (yours) or at triage (an unboarded one). Priority is a **board field**, not a label, so it lives on the card and an unboarded issue has nowhere to store it. Derive it with the rubric in [Setting issue priority](#setting-issue-priority) rather than asserting it — an unscored "this feels urgent" is exactly what the rubric exists to replace.
- **Add the issue to the board and set Status and Priority.** After creating an issue, add it to the board for its version — **`v2` → board #28**, **`v1` → board #11** — and set the fields. (PRs are never added to either board — they're tracked through their linked issue's card.) This is the step most easily forgotten because it needs several IDs — copy the recipes below verbatim, and take them from the section for the right board; the two projects' ids are not interchangeable.
  - **An issue you create → `Todo`.** You only file an issue for work you intend to happen, so filing it is approving it. It gets a milestone and lands in Todo, ready to be picked up. Work you are starting immediately goes straight to **In Progress** instead.
  - **An issue that arrives unboarded and unmilestoned → `Incoming`.** Nobody has evaluated it yet, so it is not approved and gets no release bucket — whoever filed it. See [Triaging unboarded issues](#triaging-unboarded-issues). Never park an unreviewed issue in Todo — Todo asserts a maintainer signed off, and using it as the inbox erases that distinction and quietly promotes unreviewed work into the queue.
  - **Priority is v2-only.** Board #28 has a Priority field; board #11 does not. A v1 issue gets a Status and nothing else.
- **Every issue you create gets a milestone — no exceptions.** Set it at create time with `gh issue create --milestone <title> ...`, and place it in **Todo**. **If the user didn't specify one, default to the current milestone**: the open milestone with the nearest due date. Never leave an issue you filed unmilestoned pending a decision — an unmilestoned issue drops out of release planning silently, the same way an unlabeled one drops out of version filtering. Moving it later is one command; noticing it was never set is the hard part. (An issue that arrives **unboarded** is the deliberate exception: it stays unmilestoned in Incoming until a maintainer approves it — there, the *absence* of a milestone is the signal that nobody has scheduled it yet.) Get the current milestone with:

  ```sh
  # Open milestones, soonest due date first — the first row is the current one.
  gh api repos/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/milestones --jq \
    'map(select(.state=="open")) | sort_by(.due_on) | .[] | "\(.title)\tdue \(.due_on[0:10])\topen=\(.open_issues)"'
  ```

  Milestones are **release** buckets (`v2.1.0`, `v2.2.0`, …), so pick by _when the work ships_, not by size. If a new issue plainly can't make the current milestone, say so and put it in the next one rather than leaving it blank. Sub-issues normally inherit their parent's milestone — if a sub-task must ship with its parent, they belong in the same one.

- When work begins, create a feature branch and set the item's Status to **In Progress**.
- **Branch names start with the target version segment.** The first path segment must be the version whose base branch the PR targets — `v2/` for work on `v2/main`, `v1/` for work on `v1/main` — followed by the usual type and slug: `v2/ci/restore-claude-workflow`, `v2/fix/oauth-scope-union`, `v1/fix/proxy-ssrf-pin`. Not `ci/restore-claude-workflow`. This keeps the two lines legible in `git branch -a` and in the PR list once v1 and v2 branches coexist on the same remote, and it matches the base branches themselves (`v2/main`, `v1/main`).
- When work is complete:
  - Run `npm run ci` from the root — the mandatory pre-push gate (see [Mandatory pre-push gate](#mandatory-pre-push-gate)). `npm run validate` is the fast inner-loop check and is **not** a substitute: it runs no coverage gate, no smokes, and no Storybook tests.
  - **Sign off your commits — the DCO check is a hard merge gate.** The repo runs the [probot DCO app](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/), which fails the PR unless each commit carries a `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` trailer whose name **and** email match either the commit's **author or its committer** (the validator checks both, so a cherry-picker's own signoff is accepted). Its only exemptions are **merge commits** and **bot-authored** commits, which it skips; everything else counts, and there is no partial credit — one unsigned commit out of six fails the whole check. The app *does* expose an override button to anyone with write access, but treat it as unavailable — see the repair bullet below for why.
    - **Prevent it with `git commit -s`** — the failure is invisible until after you have pushed, so make the flag habitual. Two things that look like automation and are not:

      - ⚠️ **`git config format.signOff true` does nothing here.** Despite the name it only defaults the `-s` flag for `git format-patch`; `git commit` never reads it, and there is no `commit.signoff` equivalent. Setting it looks like a fix and silently changes nothing.
      - ⚠️ **A `prepare-commit-msg` hook works, but think before installing one.** It would satisfy the check — a hook signs with your configured identity, and you are the committer, which the validator accepts. The objection is not mechanical but what it means: the trailer is a certification, and a hook makes it on your behalf for *every* commit, including work you merely cherry-picked or applied on someone else's behalf. Verified that the hook cannot distinguish those cases: inside `prepare-commit-msg`, `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT` returns your config identity rather than the preserved author, so it cannot even tell that it is signing for someone else's authorship. Prefer `-s`, where each certification is a deliberate act.

    - **Repairing already-pushed commits** means rewriting them: `git rebase HEAD~<n> --signoff`, then `git push --force-with-lease`. Use `--force-with-lease` rather than `--force` so a concurrent push can't be silently clobbered, and only rewrite when you are the sole author and nobody else has based work on the branch — the usual [perils of rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing). **Rewriting is the only legitimate repair, and the two apparent alternatives are not.** The app's empty "remediation commit" flow requires `allowRemediationCommits.individual`; this repo ships no `.github/dco.yml`, so it runs with that disabled and the original unsigned commits keep failing. The app *does* also give anyone with write access an override button that forces the check green — but it only silences the check, it does not make the author certify anything, and the signoff is the certification (see below). Using it on your own unsigned commits asserts nothing while looking like compliance, so don't: sign the commits instead. If others are working on the branch, coordinate with them before rewriting.
    - The signoff is a **[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)** assertion, made in **your own name**. It does not claim you wrote the code — the DCO expressly covers submitting work created by others that you have the right to submit — so signing off a commit you cherry-picked is legitimate. What is never acceptable is fabricating *someone else's* certification: don't add a trailer bearing another person's name or email. If a commit needs their signoff, they add it.
  - Open a PR against the matching base branch (`v1/main` for v1, `v2/main` for v2) and set the item's Status to **In Review**
  - **Attach screenshots as proof of functionality.** Any change to the web UI or the TUI must show its result: capture before/after screenshots (or a short GIF for an interaction) and put them in a **`pr-screenshots/` folder off the repo root**, creating it if it doesn't exist. That folder is **gitignored** — the images are working artifacts staged for upload, never committed to the source tree — so attach them to the PR body from there rather than referencing an in-repo path. Name them for what they show (`tools-tab-before.png`, `tools-tab-after.png`), not `Screenshot 2026-07-31 at 14.02.11.png`.
  - **Link the PR to its issue — mandatory for every PR, from anyone.** No PR is opened without an issue to reference; if one doesn't exist yet, create it first (labeled and on the board) rather than opening the PR and backfilling. Note also that only the **repo maintainers** open PRs at all (see [Contributing](#contributing)) — everyone else files a detailed issue. The PR body's **first line must be `Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>`**. ⚠️ Note: closing keywords only auto-link/auto-close for PRs targeting the repo's **default branch** (`main`). Because v2 PRs target `v2/main` (a non-default branch), `Closes #N` there is only a cross-reference — it will **not** create a hard link or close the issue on merge. (There is no `gh` flag for manual linking — `gh pr edit` has no `--add-issue`; closing keywords are the only mechanism GitHub exposes, and they're gated to the default branch.)
  - **On merge of a v2 PR, manually close its issue and move the board item to Done** (option id `259d6aab`), since auto-close won't fire on `v2/main`. Keep the `Closes #N` line anyway so the issues close automatically if/when `v2/main` is eventually merged to `main`.
- **`Done` means the work shipped. An issue closed for any other reason is REMOVED from the board, not moved to Done.** Exactly two things earn a card a place in Done:
  1. Its **PR merged**, or
  2. it is a **parent whose last sub-issue closed** — the work shipped across its children rather than through one PR of its own.

  Anything else — duplicate, won't fix, not planned, obsolete, superseded — means nothing shipped, so **delete the card**:

  ```sh
  ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json --limit 500 \
    --jq '.items[] | select(.content.number==<ISSUE_NUMBER>) | .id')
  gh project item-delete 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --id "$ITEM_ID"
  ```

  Deleting the card removes it from the board only — **the issue itself is untouched**, keeps its labels and comments, and stays searchable and linkable forever. Nothing is lost; the board simply stops claiming the work was delivered.

  Done is read as the record of what a milestone actually delivered, so a card parked there asserts something shipped. A duplicate sitting in Done makes that record wrong in a way nobody can detect later — counting Done cards can no longer distinguish a shipped fix from a report closed as a duplicate of one. Board columns are a workflow signal; GitHub's issue list is the archive. The close **reason** is the machine-readable form of the same distinction: `gh issue close --reason` accepts only `completed` and `not planned`, so **`duplicate` must be set through the API** — `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/N -X PATCH -f state=closed -f state_reason=duplicate` — or via "Mark as duplicate" in the web UI, which additionally records a duplicate-of link.
- If new tasks are discovered or requested during development, create issues and add them to the board.

### Triaging unboarded issues

**An issue needs triage when it arrives with no board card and no milestone — regardless of who filed it.** That is the whole test, and it is deliberately about *state*, not authorship.

It's tempting to frame this as "issues from outside reporters," but that's the wrong line. An outside reporter has no board access, so their issue necessarily lands this way — but so does a **maintainer's**, whenever they open one by hand instead of through the [documented create flow](#issue-driven-work-style). Write access makes the board *reachable*, not automatic. What puts an issue in Todo is somebody performing the approval — labeling it, milestoning it, and carding it — and an issue nobody did that for has not been approved, whoever's name is on it.

So don't check the author's permissions; check whether the work was done. Arriving unboarded and unmilestoned is a normal state, not a defect to fix at the moment it lands — the issue enters the system through triage, in two distinct passes.

**"Triage new issues" means running pass 1 over every unboarded open issue, then the [board audit](#the-board-audit) below.** Pass 2 is a human judgment call and is never done unprompted.

#### Pass 1 — sweep them onto the board (no approval implied)

For each open issue with no card:

1. Apply the version label (`v2` unless it's a fix for released v1 behavior — see [Label by version](#issue-driven-work-style)) **and the type label** (`bug` / `enhancement` / `documentation` / `chore` / `question` — see [Label by type](#issue-driven-work-style)). An outside reporter cannot set either, so both are applied here.
2. Add it to the board for that version — **`v2` → #28, `v1` → #11**.
3. Set Status to **`Incoming`**.
4. Set Priority with the [rubric](#setting-issue-priority) (v2 only), and **record the score in a comment** (see [Recording the score](#recording-the-score)). This is an *assessment*, not an approval — it's how the queue gets ordered for the maintainer who reviews it next.
5. **Leave the milestone unset.** Nobody has committed to shipping it yet, and an empty milestone is precisely what marks it as awaiting review.

**The one exception is an unboarded issue that already carries a milestone.** Someone recorded the approval and only the card is missing, so don't demote it to Incoming — board it straight into **Todo**, keeping the milestone. Otherwise triage would silently un-approve work a maintainer had already scheduled.

Find the unboarded ones by diffing the open issues against **both boards**. Diffing against #28 alone is wrong: a `v1` issue correctly carded on #11 is reported as unboarded and gets double-boarded (a real defect a past sweep introduced — #1929 reproduced it).

```sh
D=$(mktemp -d)
gh issue list --repo modelcontextprotocol/inspector --state open --limit 1000 \
  --json number,milestone > "$D/open.json"
# Union of BOTH boards, filtered to this repo — org boards can hold other repos' issues.
for P in 28 11; do
  gh project item-list $P --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json --limit 700 \
    | jq '[.items[] | select(.content.type=="Issue"
           and .content.repository=="modelcontextprotocol/inspector")
           | .content.number]'
done | jq -s 'add' > "$D/boarded.json"
# Prints the destination too: milestoned already → Todo, otherwise → Incoming.
jq -r --slurpfile b "$D/boarded.json" \
  '.[] | select(.number as $n | ($b[0]|index($n))|not)
   | "#\(.number)\t→ \(if .milestone then "Todo (has milestone \(.milestone.title))" else "Incoming" end)"' \
  "$D/open.json"
```

#### Pass 2 — approve what should ship

A maintainer reads the Incoming column and, for each issue worth doing, **assigns a milestone** and moves the card to **Todo** (or **In Progress** if picking it up now). That is the whole approval gesture; see the [Status recipe](#v2-board-28-gh-recipes).

This pass is **a judgment call reserved for a human** — deciding what ships in which release is not something to infer from a rubric. Never promote a card out of Incoming as part of a routine sweep; "triage new issues" stops at the end of pass 1.

Issues that shouldn't ship stay in Incoming (or get closed). **Incoming is the review queue, and "milestoned" is the line between reviewed and not** — which is why the milestone stays off in pass 1 and why the rubric can treat a milestone as a real signal rather than a formality every issue carries.

#### The board audit

Sweeping in the unboarded issues is only the most visible defect class. A board drifts in several other ways that no single-issue rule catches, so **finish a triage run with the audit below** — every check should print `0`. Each maps to a rule stated elsewhere in this document; a non-zero count means the board contradicts the rule, not that the rule needs revisiting.

| Check | Invariant | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Double-boarded | An issue has a card on **one** board, the one matching its version label | Delete the wrong-board card (`gh project item-delete`) |
| Non-Issue items | **Only issues go on a board** — never PRs, never drafts | Delete the item; the PR is tracked via its issue's `Closes #N` |
| No Status | Every card carries a Status | Set one — `Incoming` if unmilestoned, else by where it actually is |
| `Incoming` **with** a milestone | Incoming ⇔ no milestone | Approval was never recorded: move to **Todo**, or clear the milestone |
| Past Incoming **without** a milestone | Everything past Incoming ⇔ milestoned | Claims an approval nobody made: milestone it, or move back to Incoming |
| Wrong board for label | `v1` → #11, `v2` → #28 | Move the card to the right board |
| No version label | Every issue carries exactly one of `v1`/`v2` | Apply it (`v2` unless it's a fix for released v1 behavior) |
| No type label | Every issue carries one of `bug`/`enhancement`/`documentation`/`chore`/`question` | Classify it per [Label by type](#issue-driven-work-style) |
| No Priority (#28) | Every board item is prioritized | Score it with the [rubric](#setting-issue-priority) |
| Closed, not shipped, still carded | **Done means the work shipped** — a card closed as duplicate/not-planned is deleted, not parked | Delete the card (`gh project item-delete`) |

  } | to_entries[] | "\(.value|length)\t\(.key)\t\(.value[0:10])"'
```

Two things the queries must account for, both learned the hard way:

- **Filter by repository.** These are **org** projects and can hold cards from any repo in the org — board #11 currently carries one `modelcontextprotocol/servers` issue. Without the `.content.repository` filter it reads as a statusless-card defect and "fixing" it would mean editing another repo's tracking.
- **Only open issues have a `$I` entry.** A closed issue still has a card (correctly, in `Done`), so a check that treats "no milestone found" as a violation must gate on `open(.n)` or it flags every closed card.

**Do not "fix" a `Done` card that is missing a milestone.** Cards predating a rule are not defects to backfill in bulk — the audit exists to stop *new* drift, and rewriting settled history destroys the record of when a rule started being enforced.

## Setting issue priority

Every issue gets a **Priority on its board card**, set when you add the issue to the board. Score it rather than assert it: rate two axes 1–5, add the signal bonuses, and read the total off the band table. The point is that two people triaging the same issue land in the same place, and that the reasoning survives in a form someone can argue with later.

> ⚠️ **There are two different "Priority" fields on an issue page, and they are unrelated. Ours is the one under _Projects → Inspector V2_.**
>
> | Where it appears                         | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Ours?                                          |

**Axis 1 — Severity / impact (1–5).** How bad is it when it happens?

| Score | Means                                                                                              |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Cosmetic — a typo, a misaligned control, a wording nit.                                            |
| 2     | Minor friction with an easy workaround.                                                            |
| 3     | A real feature is broken or missing; the workaround is annoying or partial.                        |
| 4     | A core workflow is unusable, or the Inspector reports something false about the server under test. |
| 5     | Data loss, a security vulnerability, or a release that is broken on arrival for everyone.          |

**Axis 2 — Urgency / staleness (1–5).** How time-sensitive or neglected is it?

| Score | Means                                                                                          |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | No time pressure; nothing waits on it.                                                         |
| 2     | Wanted eventually.                                                                             |
| 3     | Wanted this milestone, or has sat >90 days with no activity.                                   |
| 4     | Blocking other work, or tied to a dated external dependency (an SDK release, a spec deadline). |
| 5     | Blocking a release, or actively hurting users on a published version right now.                |

**Signal indicators (bonuses, +1 each — not an axis of their own).** These are corroborating evidence that the two axes may have undercounted, so they adjust the total rather than standing alone:

- Carries a `bug` or security-related label
- Linked to a milestone — i.e. **already approved** by a maintainer. Note this is the *re-scoring* case: an issue being scored in a pass-1 triage has no milestone yet by rule, so it never earns this one. If you find yourself applying it to every issue in a batch, the milestone is being used as a formality rather than as approval, and the bonus has become a constant that discriminates nothing.
- High engagement (many comments or reactions)
- Assigned to someone
- A sub-issue of a larger epic
- The reporter set `Fields → Priority` to **Urgent or High** — **+1, flat, whichever of the two they picked.** It does not map to a band, and `Urgent` earns exactly what `High` earns. See below.

**Bands.** Axes give 2–10 and there are six bonuses, so the total runs 2–16.

| Total | Priority   | Meaning                     |
| ----- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 12+   | **Urgent** | Drop what you're doing.     |
| 9–11  | **High**   | Next up after current work. |
| 6–8   | **Medium** | Scheduled normally.         |
| ≤5    | **Low**    | Nice to have; may sit.      |

Note that severity alone doesn't reach Urgent: a 5/5 with no corroborating signals totals 10 and lands **High**. That's deliberate — Urgent is reserved for a severe problem that something _else_ also confirms is burning, and a band that everything qualifies for stops carrying information. Override the band when it's plainly wrong, but say why in the issue; a rubric nobody may overrule is a rubric people route around.

Set the resulting level on the board card with the Priority recipe in the [V2 board (#28) `gh` recipes](#v2-board-28-gh-recipes) below.

### Recording the score

The board stores only the *result* — a card reading `High` with no trace of how it got there. Since [the boards are private](#trust-boundary-who-can-set-what), that result is also invisible to the reporter. So **when you score an issue during triage, post the arithmetic as a comment on the issue.** Without it the rubric's promise — that the reasoning "survives in a form someone can argue with later" — is not kept by anything, and a later re-scoring has no way to tell a considered judgment from a guess.

Keep it to the two axes, the bonuses claimed, and the total:

```sh
gh issue comment <N> --repo modelcontextprotocol/inspector --body \
'**Triage:** Priority **Medium** (total 7)

- Severity 3 — a real feature is broken; workaround is partial
- Urgency 2 — wanted eventually, nothing blocked on it
- Bonuses: +1 `bug` label, +1 reporter set Fields → Priority to High

Board: #28, Status `Incoming` (awaiting maintainer review — no milestone yet).'
```

Name the bonuses you claimed rather than just summing them — the milestone bonus in particular should be conspicuously absent on a pass-1 triage, and a comment that lists it is a visible sign the [approval semantics](#triaging-unboarded-issues) were misapplied.

### Trust boundary: who can set what

**The boards are private** (`public: false`, both #28 and #11 — verified 2026-08-01). The Status and Priority a maintainer assigns are visible only to people with project access: a reporter cannot see them, cannot set them, and will never learn how their issue was scored. Board priority is a maintainers' working queue, not a published commitment.

The org-level `Fields → Priority` is the opposite. It renders on the public issue page and is **not** part of maintainer triage, so any value there is **untrusted** — we didn't put it there, and it carries a preference rather than an assessment.

That asymmetry is the whole reason the reporter's value earns a flat +1 and nothing more:

- **It counts for something.** Someone flagging their own issue is real information about how much it hurts them. Discarding it throws away a signal we'd otherwise have to infer.
- **It cannot decide an outcome.** The bonus is capped, identical for `Urgent` and `High`, and can lift an issue at most one band. Nothing a reporter can type reaches Urgent by itself: Urgent needs 12, so the issue must already sit at 11 on maintainer-assessed axes — at which point the reporter is not the reason.
- **Never map the value across.** A reporter selecting `Urgent` does **not** make the board card Urgent. Doing that would hand queue position to anyone with a GitHub account, and the queue would sort by assertiveness instead of impact.

Don't lean on GitHub's permission gate to enforce this. Whether an outside reporter can set that field today is an implementation detail that can change without notice; the rule holds either way, because it rests on _who assessed the issue_ rather than on who was technically able to click.

**Assess board Priority at boarding time**, from the issue as it stands. The reporter's value is one input among several, weighted as above.

## Repository & Project Boards

- **Repo**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector.git
- **Base Branches** — three branches, three distinct roles. Target the one matching the work; never open a PR against `main`.

  | Branch    | Role                                                                                            | PRs target it?                                            | Publishes to                                     |
  | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | `v2/main` | **Develop.** All active v2 work lands here.                                                     | **Yes** — every v2 PR                                     | nothing directly; reaches npm via `main`         |
  | `main`    | **Release.** The repo's default branch; holds the latest released v2. Not a development branch. | **No** — it only receives milestone merges from `v2/main` | `latest`                                         |
  | `v1/main` | **Maintenance.** The deprecated v1 line, security fixes only, no active development.            | **Yes** — every v1 PR, directly                           | `v1-latest`, published straight from this branch |

  So v2 flows `feature branch → v2/main → (milestone) main → npm latest`, while v1 is flat: `feature branch → v1/main → npm v1-latest`, with no merge into `main` at any point. The two lines are published independently under separate dist-tags, which is why a v1 fix does **not** need to be forward-ported to reach users on v1 (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@v1-latest`).

  ⚠️ **The version bump rides that same flow — it is made on `v2/main`, never on the milestone-merge branch (#2010).** `npm version <x> --no-git-tag-version` lands on `v2/main` *before* the milestone merge, so the bump reaches `main` as part of the milestone's work; the release tag (bare `x.y.z`, no `v` prefix) is then applied to the resulting **`main`** commit. This deliberately leaves a normal in-flight interval where `v2/main` reads the version being built and `main` the one currently released — that difference is expected. The invariant it buys is that they converge when the release merge lands, so `v2/main` is never left *behind* `main` afterwards. Bumping on the milestone-merge branch instead (which is cut from `main`) puts the bump only downstream of `v2/main`, where nothing carries it back — that is how `v2/main` sat at `2.0.0` through both the 2.1.0 and 2.2.0 releases, and how #2009 came to carry an unrelated `2.0.0 → 2.2.0` diff simply because its branch was cut from a milestone-merge branch. **Never close a drift by merging `main` into `v2/main`**: `main` holds the whole pre-v2 v1 history (~230 commits `v2/main` lacks), so a back-merge grafts all of it into the develop branch permanently to deliver a two-file change. Full procedure in the root README's [Cutting a release](./README.md#cutting-a-release).

  A corollary for **branching**: cut feature branches from **`v2/main`**, never from a milestone-merge branch — the latter carries release-only commits that will show up in your PR's diff.

- **Project Boards**:
  - v2 - https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/28 (active board — all new work goes here)
  - v1 - https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/11 (legacy inspector version, no new activity except security fixes)

  **On both boards, `Incoming` is the review queue for issues that arrived unboarded** — swept in at triage with a Priority but deliberately **no milestone** (see [Triaging unboarded issues](#triaging-unboarded-issues)). A card only leaves Incoming when a maintainer has looked at it and approved the work by assigning a milestone, at which time it should move to **Todo** — unless the maintainer has chosen to work on it, in which case it should move to **In Progress**. Assigning the milestone *is* the approval act, so the two always go together: a milestoned card sitting in Incoming is a card whose approval was never recorded, and a Todo card with no milestone claims an approval nobody made. An issue created through the documented flow skips Incoming entirely — doing that flow is approving it, so it starts milestoned in Todo. The two boards are otherwise separate projects with their own field and option ids; never reuse one board's ids against the other (they are rejected with "option Id does not belong to the field", so the mistake is at least loud).

#### V2 board (#28) `gh` recipes

The board is an **org project**, so all commands use `--owner modelcontextprotocol` and the numeric project `28`. The project node id and the field ids are stable. **The _option_ ids are NOT stable — they are regenerated whenever a single-select field's option list is edited** (see the ⚠️ hazard below). If any option id here is rejected, re-fetch the current set with:

```sh
# Swap "Status" for "Priority" to fetch the other field's options.
gh project field-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json \
  | jq '.fields[] | select(.name=="Status") | .options'
```

| Thing             | ID                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Project node ID   | `PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt`           |
| Status field ID   | `PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c` |
| Priority field ID | `PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iJE4` |

Status option IDs (`--single-select-option-id`) — **last verified 2026-08-01**.

| Status      | Option ID  |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Incoming    | `721a3d4c` |
| Todo        | `fbdaf21e` |
| In Progress | `195df262` |
| In Review   | `159c8a02` |
| Done        | `259d6aab` |

Use **Incoming** for an issue that arrived unboarded and is awaiting review (no milestone yet), **Todo** once a maintainer has approved it by assigning a milestone — including an issue you created through the documented flow, which starts here — **In Progress** for general active work (regardless of surface), **In Review** once a PR is open, and **Done** on merge — and *only* on merge (or a parent's last sub-issue closing). An issue closed for any other reason has its **card deleted**, because [Done asserts the work shipped](#issue-driven-work-style). The Incoming/Todo line is the one that matters: Todo asserts approval, so an unreviewed issue parked there is a false claim that someone signed off on it. The milestone is the machine-checkable form of that claim — Incoming ⇔ no milestone, everything past it ⇔ milestoned.

Priority option IDs (`--single-select-option-id`) — **last verified 2026-08-01**. Derive the level with the rubric in [Setting issue priority](#setting-issue-priority); don't eyeball it.

| Priority | Option ID  | Rubric total |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Urgent   | `79628723` | 12+          |
| High     | `0a877460` | 9–11         |
| Medium   | `da944a9c` | 6–8          |
| Low      | `d67ac7ce` | ≤5           |

> ⚠️ **Never add, rename, or remove an option on a single-select board field (Status or Priority) with the `updateProjectV2Field` GraphQL mutation unless you pass every existing option's `id`.** That mutation does a **full replace** of the option list: if you resend options by name/color/description but omit their `id`s, GitHub **deletes all existing options and mints new ones**, which **orphans that field's value on every card on the board** (all items go blank for the field you edited — Status if you were editing Status, Priority if you were editing Priority) _and_ invalidates every option id in that field's table above. This has happened once, on Status (required reconstructing ~197 items' statuses by inference). Safe alternatives, in order of preference:
>
> 1. **Add or rename an option in the GitHub web UI** (Project #28 → the field's settings). This preserves ids of untouched options and never orphans the cards on _other_ options. ⚠️ **Deleting is different, in the UI as much as in the API: removing an option blanks that field's value on every card that held it, with no undo and no warning that says so.** Before deleting any option, snapshot the board (see recovery below).
> 2. If you must script it, first `gh api graphql` the current options **with their `id`s**, then call `updateProjectV2Field` echoing back every existing option **including its `id`**, appending only the new one. `ProjectV2SingleSelectFieldOptionInput.id` is an optional `String`, so a mixed list works: echo the `id` for every option that already exists, omit it only for the one being added. Verify afterward that no card lost its value — snapshot `gh project item-list … --format json` before and after and diff, don't just spot-check.
>
> Both the `Incoming` Status option and the Urgent/High/Medium/Low `Priority` options were added this way (#1891), with the before/after diff confirming all 264 cards kept their Status.
>
> `gh project item-add` and `gh project item-edit` are always safe — they set a card's value and never touch the field schema. When option ids change for any reason, **re-verify and update the table above** (and the references in the recipes below and the merge step above).
>
> ### Always snapshot before touching a field's options
>
> One command, and it is the difference between a five-minute restore and reconstructing statuses by inference:
>
> ```sh
> gh project item-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json --limit 600 > board-snapshot.json
> ```
>
> ### Recovering from a deleted option
>
> This has now happened twice — once via the API (~197 items, reconstructed by inference) and once via the UI (the `Done` column, 247 items, restored from a snapshot in minutes). With a snapshot the recovery is mechanical.
>
> **The recipe below is written for a deleted _Status_ option** — it reads `.status` and writes the Status field id. For a deleted **Priority** option it is the same three steps with two substitutions: read `.priority` instead of `.status` (`gh project item-list --format json` exposes each single-select field under its lowercased name, so both keys are present), and pass the Priority field id `PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iJE4` instead of the Status one. Everything else — the snapshot, the grouping safety check, the new-id caveat — applies unchanged.

> done
> ```
>
> Step 1's grouping is the safety check: confirm the orphaned set is exactly the cards that held the deleted option, so you don't overwrite a card someone legitimately moved in the meantime. And because the recreated option carries a **new id**, the table above and every reference to it must be updated in the same change — `grep` the old id across the repo. The `Done` id has been `248a3910` and is now `259d6aab` for exactly this reason.

```sh
# 1. Add an issue to the board — prints the item id (PVTI_…); capture it.
gh project item-add 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --url <issue-url> --format json

# 2. Set its Status (here: In Progress). Use the option id from the table above.
gh project item-edit \
  --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt \
  --id <item-id-from-step-1> \
  --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c \
  --single-select-option-id 195df262
```

The full one-liner for an issue **you just created** — add it, then set Status and Priority (both required). It goes to **Todo**, because filing it was the approval, and it already carries the milestone you passed to `gh issue create`:

```sh
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-add 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --url <issue-url> --format json --jq '.id')
# Status → Todo (an issue you filed is approved by definition)
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$ITEM_ID" --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c --single-select-option-id fbdaf21e
# Priority → Medium
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$ITEM_ID" --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iJE4 --single-select-option-id da944a9c
```

For an issue **swept in at triage** (arrived unboarded, no milestone), the only difference is the Status option — **Incoming** (`721a3d4c`) instead of Todo — and that you do **not** set a milestone:

```sh
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-add 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --url <issue-url> --format json --jq '.id')
# Status → Incoming (awaiting maintainer review; no milestone yet)
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$ITEM_ID" --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c --single-select-option-id 721a3d4c
# Priority → Medium (an assessment for queue ordering, not an approval)
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$ITEM_ID" --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iJE4 --single-select-option-id da944a9c
```

Each `item-edit` sets **one** field, so setting both takes two calls — there is no combined form.

For an issue **already on the board** (moving an existing card, e.g. to **In Review** when its PR opens, or re-scoring its Priority), look its item id up by issue number instead of re-adding it. Keep `--limit` above the board's item count (~265 as of 2026-08-01) — past it `item-list` truncates silently, `select` matches nothing, and `item-edit --id ""` fails with an opaque node-resolution error rather than saying the limit was too low:

```sh
# --limit must stay above the board's item count (~265 today) — past it the
# list truncates silently and item-edit fails with an opaque node-resolution error.
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json --limit 500 \
  --jq '.items[] | select(.content.number==<ISSUE_NUMBER>) | .id')
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$ITEM_ID" --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c --single-select-option-id 159c8a02
```

#### V1 board (#11) `gh` recipes

The v1 line takes **security fixes only**, so this board sees little traffic — but a v1 issue still gets a card, and the same Incoming/Todo split applies: one created through the documented flow starts in **Todo**, one that arrived unboarded starts in **Incoming** awaiting review. Board #11 is a separate org project with **its own ids**; none of the #28 ids above work here.

| Thing           | ID                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Project node ID | `PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BA5sz`           |
| Status field ID | `PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BA5szzgzkS-g` |

Status option IDs — **last verified 2026-08-01**.

| Status      | Option ID  |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Incoming    | `831820cf` |
| Todo        | `f75ad846` |
| In Progress | `47fc9ee4` |
| In Review   | `0439b2bf` |
| Done        | `98236657` |

There is **no Priority field on this board** — the priority rubric applies to v2 only. Don't try to set one here; the field id doesn't exist.

```sh
# Add a v1 issue to board #11. Swap the option id for the case you're in:
#   831820cf = Incoming — arrived unboarded, awaiting review (no milestone)
#   f75ad846 = Todo     — created through the documented flow (milestoned at create time)
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-add 11 --owner modelcontextprotocol --url <issue-url> --format json --jq '.id')
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BA5sz --id "$ITEM_ID" --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BA5szzgzkS-g --single-select-option-id f75ad846
```

The ⚠️ option-deletion hazard, the snapshot rule, and the recovery recipe above apply to **this board too** — same mutation, same failure mode, different ids. Note that board #11 also carries **one card from another repo** (`modelcontextprotocol/servers`), which has no Status. That is why every audit query filters on `.content.repository` — an org project can hold items from any repo in the org, and an unfiltered check reports that card as a statusless-card defect. It is not ours to fix. (The three *inspector* cards that carried no Status on 2026-08-01 predated the `Incoming` addition and have since been set; neither case was evidence of an orphaning event.)

### Always test new or modified code

- Ensure all code has corresponding tests
- Ensure test coverage for each file is at least 90%
- In unit tests that expect error output, suppress it from the console
- Run unit tests with `npm run test` (or `npm run test:watch` during development) from `clients/web/`
- Run CLI tests with `npm run test` from `clients/cli/` (builds test-servers + CLI bin first via `pretest`)
- Run TUI tests with `npm run test` from `clients/tui/`
- Run launcher tests with `npm run test` from `clients/launcher/`
- Run the root tooling's own tests with `npm run test:scripts` from the root — `node --test "scripts/**/*.test.mjs"`, node's built-in runner (the root has no vitest harness by design). A new `scripts/*.mjs` helper with pure logic gets a sibling `*.test.mjs`; keep the filename `*.test.mjs`, since `node --test` silently **skips** a file its glob misses and still exits 0 (`verify:typecheck-coverage` guards against exactly that).
- **The test tiers, shallowest first:** unit (`test`, per client) → web integration (`test:integration`, real transports/servers) → out-of-process (`clients/cli/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`, spawns the built binary) → smokes through the built launcher (`npm run smoke`) → Storybook play functions (`test:storybook`) → the published-tarball check (`npm run pack:verify`, local/release only — needs network). `validate` runs the per-client `test` scripts — so web **unit** plus cli's out-of-process `e2e.test.ts` (it's part of cli's `test`), but **not** web's integration project, which runs inside the `coverage` gate. Everything from `smoke` rightward is `npm run ci` only, and is described under [Mandatory pre-push gate](#mandatory-pre-push-gate).
- The repo root has no aggregate `test` script — each client self-validates, so run `npm run validate` from the root (all clients, fast) or `cd clients/<name> && npm run validate` (one client). Each client still exposes its own `test` / `test:coverage` for quick iteration.
- **`validate` is fast: it runs `test`, not `test:coverage`.** The coverage gate (slower — adds v8 instrumentation, and for web the integration project) is a **separate** top-level `npm run coverage` (and per-client `coverage:web` / `coverage:cli` / `coverage:tui` / `coverage:launcher`, each delegating to that client's `test:coverage`). Run `npm run coverage` when you want to reproduce the gate locally before pushing. **CI runs `coverage`** on every push (#1550): the per-file ≥90 gate is CI-enforced, so a PR that drops any file below 90 on lines/statements/functions/branches fails the job. CI runs `validate` (fast) for format/lint/build/unit tests, then `coverage` for the instrumented gate. Because web's `test:coverage` already runs the integration project, CI has no separate `test:integration` step — the integration paths are exercised inside the coverage gate.
- Each client's `test:coverage` enforces a **uniform per-file gate of ≥ 90 on all four dimensions** — lines, statements, functions, and branches — across `clients/web`, `clients/cli`, `clients/tui`, and `clients/launcher` (CI enforces this gate). This is the result of a codebase-wide audit: the branch floor was first lifted 50 → 70 for web (#1271), then the whole gate raised to 90 with real tests added for every outlier. Genuinely-unreachable branches are **not** waved through by lowering the gate — they are annotated at the source with a justified `/* v8 ignore … -- <reason> */` comment. Acceptable reasons are happy-dom-inherent paths (Mantine portal mount points, `useMediaQuery` fallbacks, `typeof window` SSR guards), React StrictMode effect-replay blocks, and provably-dead defensive guards (e.g. a `?? fallback` for a value the types guarantee non-null, or a `Select.onChange` receiving a value outside the allowed list). New code must clear 90 on every dimension; reach for a justified `v8 ignore` only when a branch is genuinely impossible to exercise. The web coverage `include` (in `clients/web/vite.config.ts`) covers the shared `core/` runtime consumed by the browser — `core/mcp`, `core/react`, `core/auth`, `core/storage`, `core/logging`, `core/node`, **`core/json`, and `core/client`** (the last two folded in by #1689). When adding a `core/json/*` or `core/client/*` module, its tests live under `clients/web/src/test/core/…` and are gated the same ≥90 way.
- The **same per-file gate** is enforced for the CLI and TUI (#1484), not just web:
  - **CLI** (`clients/cli`): tests run **in-process** by importing `runCli()` (see `__tests__/helpers/cli-runner.ts`) so `clients/cli/src` is measured under v8 instrumentation. A thin out-of-process layer (`__tests__/e2e.test.ts` + `scripts/smoke-cli.mjs`) still spawns the built binary for the shebang/`process.exit` paths; `src/index.ts` (binary bootstrap) is the only coverage exclusion. `commander` uses `.exitOverride()` so a parse error throws instead of tearing down the test worker.
  - **TUI** (`clients/tui`): the gate now covers **all of `src/**`, React surface included** — the former interim exclusion of the Ink components, `App.tsx`, and `hooks/` was lifted in #1501. Components mount through `ink-testing-library` with the `ink-scroll-view` / `ink-form` passthrough doubles in `__tests__/helpers/`, `App.tsx` mounts against a controllable mock of the `@inspector/core` surface, and keypresses are driven through stdin. The **only** coverage exclusion left in `clients/tui/vitest.config.ts` is `src/tui-servers.ts` — a pure re-export + type alias of core's server resolver with no runtime statements of its own (the logic is measured in `core/` via the web suite; `tui-servers.test.ts` still exercises it behaviorally, and it's excluded only so it doesn't surface as a misleading 0/0 row). Any new logic under `clients/tui/src`, React or not, is held to the gate automatically.
- Run `npm run test:integration` (also from `clients/web/`) for the InspectorClient + transport + auth integration suite. It runs under a separate `integration` vitest project in node env (no happy-dom) with 30s timeouts. The script builds `test-servers/` first via `tsc -p ../../test-servers --noCheck` so the stdio MCP test server can be spawned as a real subprocess. CI does not run `test:integration` as its own step — the integration project is covered by the CI `coverage` gate, whose web `test:coverage` runs `--project=unit --project=integration --coverage`.
- Test files live alongside the source as `<Name>.test.tsx` (or `.test.ts` for non-React modules). Integration tests live under `clients/web/src/test/integration/`, mirroring the `core/` source layout (`mcp/`, `mcp/node/`, `mcp/remote/`, `auth/`, `auth/node/`, `storage/`). Any test file under that folder is automatically picked up by the `integration` vitest project (node env, 30s timeouts) via the folder glob in `vite.config.ts` — placement is the manifest, there is no enumeration to keep in sync. Tests outside the folder run in the `unit` project (happy-dom). When adding a new test for, e.g., `core/mcp/remote/foo.ts`, put it at `src/test/integration/mcp/remote/foo.test.ts`.
- **Test placement: side-by-side by default, `src/test/` only for what can't be co-located.** These look like competing conventions but aren't — the split is: _tests live beside their source, **except** tests for the repo-root `core/` package (which lives outside `clients/web/`) and shared test scaffolding — both of which live under `src/test/`, with `core/` tests mirroring the `core/` layout and integration tests under `src/test/integration/`._
  - **Side-by-side (`<Name>.test.tsx` next to the source) — the default for web's own `src/` code.** Components, hooks, `lib/`, `utils/`. This is the overwhelming majority; a web-owned test living under `src/test/` instead of beside its source is a bug (fixed one such straggler, `downloadFile.test.ts`, in #1776).
  - **`src/test/` — the three things that _cannot_ be co-located:** (1) tests of the repo-root **`core/`** package (`src/test/core/…`, mirroring the `core/` folder layout — `core/` physically lives at `/core` outside `clients/web/`, is consumed via the `@inspector/core` alias, and has no test harness of its own, so co-locating would pollute the shared isomorphic package with web-only test infra); (2) the **`integration`** vitest project (`src/test/integration/…`, node env, 30s — placement _is_ the manifest, see above); (3) **shared test infrastructure** (`renderWithMantine.tsx`, `setup.ts`, `fixtures/`, `scrollAreaStoryAssertions.ts`) — not tests _of_ a source file, so nothing to sit beside.
  - **The above is web only.** The Node clients (**cli, tui, launcher**) keep **all** their tests in a top-level **`__tests__/`** dir, not beside their source — their `tsconfig.json` excludes `**/*.test.*` and their `tsconfig.test.json` includes `__tests__/**/*` (plus, for launcher, its root `vitest.config.ts`), so a co-located `src/**/*.test.*` lands in **no** tsconfig project and fails `npm run verify:typecheck-coverage` (#1791). Put a new cli/tui/launcher test under `__tests__/`.
- Use `renderWithMantine` from `src/test/renderWithMantine.tsx` to render components — it wraps in `MantineProvider` with the project theme. It sets `env="test"`, which makes Mantine skip the transition's animated **render** — but be clear on what that does *not* buy you: it does **not** stop the timers. `env` is read only by `Transition.mjs`, at its render branch (`transitionDuration === 0 || env === "test"`), while `useTransition()` runs before that check (hooks cannot be conditional) and still schedules real `window.setTimeout`s on every `mounted` change. Measured: opening a `<Modal>` through `renderWithMantine` schedules three 200ms timers (#1984). A timer that outlives its file fires after happy-dom disposes that file's `window`, and React's `dispatchSetState` then throws an uncaught `ReferenceError: window is not defined` that fails the **whole run** — attributed to whichever file was running, so it lands on an innocent one (#1760). What actually prevents that is the **leaked-timer safety net in `src/test/setup.ts`**, which tracks every timer and clears whatever is still pending after `cleanup()`; see the comment there for the rAF race that makes Mantine's own unmount cleanup insufficient. **Always render through `renderWithMantine`; do not hand-roll a bare `MantineProvider` in a test** — a hand-rolled provider skips the project theme and the helper's options and drifts from every other test. Note this rule used to be justified by the leak class, which is now wrong: the `setup.ts` net is global and covers every unit test however it renders. The rule stands on consistency, not on timer safety. To exercise a **forced color scheme** (e.g. the `useComputedColorScheme` dark branch) pass the `colorScheme` option — `renderWithMantine(ui, { colorScheme: "dark" })` — instead of hand-rolling a `defaultColorScheme="dark"` provider (#1786). Only when a test must assert _mid-flight_ transition state (e.g. a `data-anim="out"` cell during an exit crossfade) use `renderWithMantineTransitions` (real transitions). Such a test can leak the #1760 class because waiting for one cell to unmount does **not** settle a concurrent _enter_ (a completed enter leaves no DOM signal to `waitFor`), so the helper **automatically drains the in-flight animation after the test**. The rule for using it: pass `settleMs` derived from the component's real animation duration — its `Transition` `duration`/`exitDuration` plus any `enterDelay`/`exitDelay` plus rAF slack — e.g. `renderWithMantineTransitions(ui, { settleMs: HEADER_ANIM_MS + 200 })` (so the window can't silently become insufficient when that duration changes); do **not** also use `vi.useFakeTimers()` in the same test (the auto-settle no-ops under fake timers — it warns, but anything the test left pending on the _real_ clock is then unprotected, so the test depends on which clock was installed at teardown); and if the test unmounts the tree itself, use the `unmount()` the helper returns (it drops that tree from the settle's liveness check, while still draining — a bare mid-body `cleanup()` on a still-armed tree would trip the check). The mechanism behind all three — why the drain is `act`-wrapped, the fake-timer hazard, the `afterEach`-before-`cleanup()` ordering and its `container.isConnected` self-checks, and the exported `settleTransitions(ms)` for manual mid-body settling — is documented at length on the helper in `renderWithMantine.tsx`; read there before changing it.

### Responding to Code Reviews

- When asked to respond to a code review of a PR,
  - it is not necessary to implement all suggestions
  - you are free to implement suggestions in a different way or to ignore if there is a good reason
  - after making the changes, respond to each review comment with what was done (or why it was ignored)

### Mandatory pre-push gate

- ALWAYS do `npm run format` before committing — the **root** `format` auto-fixes `core/` (`format:core`), the root `scripts/` tooling (`format:scripts`), the root "shared" surface (`format:shared` — `test-servers/src/**`, `vitest.shared.mts`, the root `eslint.config.js`), and every client's scope in one shot. Every **client** format glob uses the uniform extension set `*.{ts,tsx,mts,cts,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}` (#1792) so a new-extension file can't slip the gate; `core/` stays `{ts,tsx}` and the shared surface `{ts,tsx,mts,cts}` (their surfaces can't hold the other extensions), and `npm run verify:format-coverage` (the first step of `validate`, #1792) is the backstop — it fails if any tracked source file is left uncovered by a `format:check` glob regardless of which glob was expected to catch it. `validate` runs `format:check` (the non-fixing variant, including `format:check:core`, `format:check:scripts`, and `format:check:shared`) and will fail in CI on any unformatted file, so always run the auto-fixer first rather than letting `format:check` catch it.
- **`npm run ci` is the mandatory pre-push command** — it mirrors `.github/workflows/main.yml` (minus `npm install`): `validate` → `coverage` → `verify:build-gate` (the #1769 browser-externalized-builtin build gate) → `smoke` → Storybook play-function tests (installs Playwright chromium if needed). It now runs **`npm run coverage`**, the per-file ≥90 gate (lines/statements/functions/branches) that CI enforces — so `npm run ci` is a true superset of GitHub CI, and passing it locally means CI's gates will pass. Expect several minutes. **`npm run validate`** remains the fast inner-loop check during development (unit tests only — no coverage gate, no smoke, no Storybook), but it is **NOT** an acceptable substitute for `npm run ci` before pushing: `validate` runs `test`, not `test:coverage`, so it does **zero** coverage gating. Skipping the gate is how a push passes every fast local check and still fails CI (this exact gap broke PR #1601 on a function-coverage regression).
- ALWAYS do `npm run format` before committing, then **`npm run ci`** before pushing. From the repo root, `validate` runs **`verify:format-coverage` first** (the #1792 guard — asserts every tracked source file is covered by a `format:check` glob), then **`verify:typecheck-coverage`** (the #1791 guard — asserts every tracked `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` in each gated Node client, plus the non-client first-party TS like `core/` and `test-servers/src`, lands in a tsconfig project), then **`verify:dep-lockstep`** (the #1896 guard — asserts no dependency that reaches a single `tsc` program from two installs resolves to two different versions across them), then **`test:scripts`** (the guards' own parser unit tests, `node --test`), then the **`core/` gate** (`validate:core`), then chains the four per-client validations (`validate:web` → `validate:cli` → `validate:tui` → `validate:launcher`); each client delegates to its own `npm run validate` in its own folder (no coverage — fast). Every client is self-validating and the top level just chains them, building each client's bundle along the way (no cross-client build dependencies).
  - **`validate:core` is the root-owned format + lint gate (#1689, widened in #1778 and #1767).** Each client's `prettier`/`eslint` is scoped to its own dir, so nothing reached `core/`, the root `scripts/`, or the root "shared" surface before — `validate:core` closes that: it runs `format:check:core` (`prettier --check "core/**/*.{ts,tsx}"`) + `format:check:scripts` (`prettier --check "scripts/**/*.{ts,tsx,mts,cts,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}"`, the root build/verify tooling — #1778) + `format:check:shared` + `lint:core` (`eslint "core/**/*.{ts,tsx}"` via the **root** `eslint.config.js`) + `lint:shared`. Use `npm run format:core` / `npm run format:scripts` / `npm run format:shared` to auto-fix (all folded into the root `format`). The **shared surface** (#1767) is `test-servers/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mts,cts}`, the root `vitest.shared.mts`, and the root `eslint.config.js` — first-party code no client's `eslint .` / `prettier` reaches; it is both prettier-gated (`format:check:shared`) and eslint-gated (`lint:shared`, via a second `files` block in the root `eslint.config.js` scoped to Node globals). The `scripts/` gate is prettier-only — the root has no eslint config for `.mjs`. The root carries prettier/eslint as devDependencies for this; `core/` is isomorphic (browser + Node globals, no JSX today — the `{ts,tsx}` glob future-proofs against a `core/**/*.tsx`). The root `eslint.config.js` honors an `_`-prefix as the intentionally-unused marker (`argsIgnorePattern`/`varsIgnorePattern`/`caughtErrorsIgnorePattern: '^_'`). **prettier is pinned to an exact version** (not a caret) in all five `package.json`s (#1790) so the gate's verdict can't shift with an in-range patch bump.
  - **cli and tui now typecheck their `src` (#1689).** Their `build`/`test` run through esbuild (no type check), so each has a `typecheck` script folded into `validate`. Their `tsconfig.json` matches `clients/web/tsconfig.app.json`'s module/lib _resolution_ options — DOM lib, `moduleResolution: bundler`, and **no** `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` (web's app config does not extend `tsconfig.base`, so re-enabling it would surface `core/` issues web never gates) — so the imported `core/` sources are validated the same way web validates them. It does **not** mirror web's extra strictness flags (`noUnusedLocals`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, ES2023 target, …), so cli/tui's own `src` is checked slightly more loosely than web's. `core/` itself still typechecks through web's `tsc -b`.
  - **The `__tests__` dirs are typechecked too (#1791).** The src-only `tsconfig.json` excludes `**/*.test.*`, so each of cli, tui, and launcher carries a **`tsconfig.test.json`** — extending the build config, `noEmit`, including `__tests__/**/*` (only the tests root the project; tsc pulls in the `src` they import, and the src-only config already validates all of `src` without the test-only aliases) and adding the test-only path aliases that resolve what vitest resolves via `vitest.shared.mts`. The alias set differs per client: **cli's is the widest** (`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector-test-server` → `test-servers/src`, the `@inspector/core/*` deep paths, express/vitest — cli is the only one importing the test-server package); **tui's** carries only the `@inspector/core/*` + react/vitest redirects; **launcher's** has **no** `paths` at all — it's a plain `rootDir: "."` sibling of the build config (whose `rootDir: ./src` is what rejects the tests). Each client's `typecheck` script runs **both** projects (`tsc -p tsconfig.json && tsc -p tsconfig.test.json`) so running it standalone means the same thing everywhere (launcher's `build` also `tsc`s `src`, but `typecheck` doesn't rely on that). cli additionally carries `@types/express` (devDep) so the transitively-aliased test-server source typechecks, mirroring `clients/web` (cli's `tsconfig.test.json` also names `test-servers/src/server-composable.ts` explicitly — a bin entry the barrel doesn't import, so nothing else gives it a tsc pass). The client **config files** are typechecked too: cli's/tui's (`vitest.config.ts`, `tsup.config.ts`, tui `dev.ts`) are folded into each src `tsconfig.json`'s `include`; launcher's `vitest.config.ts` goes in its `tsconfig.test.json` instead (again the `rootDir: ./src` reason). Note the gate checks mock **implementations and return types** (typing a `vi.fn<T>()` against a real signature keeps its `mockResolvedValue`/impl in sync) but **not** `toHaveBeenCalledWith(...)` arguments — vitest types those to accept anything regardless of the mock's type parameter. **`npm run verify:typecheck-coverage`** (`scripts/verify-typecheck-coverage.mjs`, run as the second step of `validate` right after `verify:format-coverage`) is the durable guard for this invariant: it runs each client's `typecheck` projects with `tsc --listFilesOnly`, unions them, and fails on any tracked `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` that lands in no project — for every gated Node client, which it discovers from disk (each `clients/*` is enrolled through its `typecheck` script's projects, or — for a `tsc -b` client like `clients/web` with no `typecheck` script — through its `tsconfig.json` `references`), so a new client is covered without editing the guard — the typecheck analog of `verify:format-coverage`, since a project only reaches the files its `include` names plus their transitive imports, so a new top-level file (launcher especially, whose build `rootDir: ./src` rejects package-root files) can otherwise fall out silently. Like its sibling it also asserts the gate is _wired_ (each client's typecheck pass is reachable from its `validate` — its `typecheck` script for cli/tui/launcher, or a real `tsc -b` for web — and the root chain runs each client's `validate`), so it can't stay green while measuring a pass nothing invokes. It asserts the same of **`test:scripts`** — its own parser tests — on three axes: reachable from the root `validate`, a **non-empty** tracked `scripts/**/*.{test,spec}.*` set, and **every one of those files matched by a glob harvested across the scripts reachable from `test:scripts`** (so a delegating `test:scripts` still measures correctly). The third axis exists because `node --test` silently _skips_ a file its glob misses and still exits 0 — a rename to `*.spec.mjs` would shrink the suite with a green run. Beyond the clients it also covers, **deny-by-default**, the first-party TS no client owns — everything tracked outside `clients/*` (`test-servers/src/**`, the root `vitest.shared.mts`, **all of `core/`**, and any new top-level TS location) must land in the _global_ union of client projects (cli aliases the test-server source; web's enrolled projects include `core/`). So a `core` `*.tsx` web's `include` doesn't reach, or an unimported `test-servers/src` bin entry, can't ship uncompiled-but-unchecked. The one "listed but unchecked" tier the guard structurally can't see — a per-file `// @ts-nocheck` — is owned by a different gate: `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` rejects it across every surface (`lint:core`, `lint:shared`, and each client's `eslint .`). The guard's own pure parsers (`scripts/lib/npm-scripts.mjs` + the exported helpers of `verify-typecheck-coverage.mjs`, whose execution is behind a `main()` so importing it for tests doesn't run it) are **unit-tested** — `npm run test:scripts` (node's built-in `node --test`, in `validate`; the root has no vitest harness by design) runs table-driven cases, one per rule the guard's parsers encode, and the guard itself enforces that this stays wired (above).
  - The one CLI nuance: `clients/cli`'s out-of-process `e2e.test.ts` spawns the built binary, so its `test` **builds first** via `pretest` (`test-servers:build && build`). To avoid building it twice, `clients/cli`'s `validate` folds that in — it is `format:check && lint && typecheck && test` with **no** separate `build` step (the other clients, whose tests don't spawn their bundle, keep an explicit `build`). `validate:web`/`validate:tui`/`validate:launcher` are the uniform `format:check && lint && (typecheck &&) build && test`. (#1778, #1789, #1792) `clients/web`'s `format`/`format:check` covers `src`, `server`, `.storybook`, and its top-level configs (the uniform `*.{ts,tsx,mts,cts,js,jsx,mjs,cjs}` glob — `vite.config.ts`, `tsup.runner.config.ts`, `eslint.config.js`, …), not just `src`, so the Node backend, Storybook config, and Vite/build config are prettier-gated too; `clients/launcher`'s covers `src`, `__tests__`, `scripts`, and its top-level configs (the `*.` top-level glob is non-recursive, so each nested dir — `.storybook`, `scripts` — is named explicitly). The `verify:format-coverage` guard (#1792) enforces that this coverage stays complete.
  - **One version per install-crossing dependency (#1896).** Because v2 is not a workspace, the root and each `clients/*` carry their own `node_modules` — and a client's `tsconfig.test.json` compiles first-party sources that live *outside* the client (`test-servers/src`, `core/`), which resolve their dependencies from the **root** install while the client's own sources resolve from the client install. So the same package can appear **twice in one `tsc` program**. At the same version that duplication is harmless; on a skew, TypeScript must relate two structurally-distinct declarations of the same type. For a deeply recursive-generic surface that is exponential: zod `4.3.6` (root) against zod `4.4.3` (`clients/web`) made `clients/web`'s `tsc -b` exhaust the 4GB default heap outright via `TS2589 Type instantiation is excessively deep`, because every `@modelcontextprotocol/*` schema is built out of zod generics. **Raising the heap with `--max-old-space-size` hides this class rather than fixing it — align the versions instead.** `npm run verify:dep-lockstep` (`scripts/verify-dep-lockstep.mjs`, in `validate`) is the durable guard: it **derives** the candidate set from **what actually enters each `tsc` program** (#1965) — every client tsconfig project is listed with `tsc --listFilesOnly` through the shared `scripts/lib/tsc-program.mjs` helper (the same machinery `verify:typecheck-coverage` reads a program through, so the two guards can't disagree about what one contains), each resolved `node_modules` file is mapped to its owning install and package, and a package reaching **one** program from **two** installs is a candidate. That is precisely the set that can put two structurally-distinct copies of a type in front of one checker — and it needs no editing when a new dependency arrives. It replaced a derivation that read the packages the shared sources named *directly*, which could not see one whose declarations arrive only through another package's `.d.ts`: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is never written in first-party code (the shared sources import the split `@modelcontextprotocol/client|core|…`) yet 16 of its `.d.ts` files land in `clients/web`'s test program, so a second copy under `clients/web/node_modules` skewed unseen. Two properties are worth knowing: a package present in two installs but reached from only one in a given program is correctly **not** a candidate, and TypeScript's package-identity redirect collapses two copies at the *same* name@version (so an aligned package's own transitive dependencies load once) — the redirect stops applying the moment they skew, which is exactly when the guard needs to see both. Versions still come from the committed lockfiles, but from the entry for the **exact install path the program resolved** (`node_modules/zod`, `node_modules/a/node_modules/zod`) rather than from the install's top-level entry: a *nested* duplicate inside one install is still not a candidate on its own — folding it onto its outermost install is what keeps the set small — but once a program has loaded one, pricing it from a top-level entry that may be absent or differently versioned would let a real pair pass (Copilot). Only the installs that actually **met in one program** are compared, so a third install's copy that no program loads beside another is not evidence of anything. Any co-occurrence whose copies disagree fails, **deny-by-default**; a resolved copy with no lockfile entry fails too, since the tree and the lockfile then disagree about what was loaded. The escape hatch is `TOLERATED_SKEW` in that file, an allowlist of *names* (not version pairs, so an ordinary patch float doesn't churn it), each entry carrying why that package's types can't blow up; it is **empty today** — the four names it used to carry (`react`, `hono`, `jose`, `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`) were admitted under the old derivation and none is a candidate under this one, so each would be a rationale for a skew that cannot occur. **Being listed is not a blanket exemption** — it tolerates skew only *within a major version*, since a rationale about patch-level differences says nothing about a React 18-vs-19 split, where the type surface itself changes; a cross-major skew fails even for a listed package. **When bumping a dependency that the shared sources pull in, bump it in every install that declares it** — that's the root plus whichever clients list it, not all four unconditionally (launcher declares no zod, for instance, and a package absent from an install can't skew, so the guard ignores it there). Don't add a dependency to a client just to satisfy this. Its pure helpers are unit-tested via `test:scripts` (its own, plus `scripts/lib/tsc-program.test.mjs` for the shared derivation), and it vouches — with `verify:format-coverage` and `verify:typecheck-coverage` — that its siblings are still wired into `validate`. It runs the same `tsc --listFilesOnly` pass its sibling does, in its own process, costing ~14s: the listing is deliberately **not** cached to disk between the two, because a fingerprint that missed an input would make a guard measure a program that no longer exists and pass on a real miss.
  - **`npm run coverage`** is the per-file ≥90 gate and is now part of `npm run ci` — never treat it as optional before a push. It supersedes the old standalone `test:integration` step: web's `test:coverage` runs the `unit` **and** `integration` projects under v8 instrumentation, so `coverage` both enforces the ≥90 gate and exercises the same web integration paths CI covers.
- **`smoke` is NOT part of `validate`** — it is included in `npm run ci`. It runs `smoke:launcher` (`--help` dispatch) plus the prod `smoke:cli` / `smoke:tui` / `smoke:web` / `smoke:web:browser` / `smoke:web:app`, and contains **no build commands** — it assumes the cli/tui/launcher bundles already exist (a full `validate` builds them; `smoke:web` builds `clients/web/dist` on demand). CI runs `validate`, then the `coverage` gate (which also covers the web integration project), then `verify:build-gate` (the #1769 build gate — see below), then `smoke` (with Playwright chromium installed just before it, since `smoke:web:browser` needs it). GitHub CI runs this same chain as separate workflow steps, with the Storybook play-function tests last (see below).
- `smoke:launcher` (`scripts/smoke-launcher.mjs`) runs the built launcher with `--help`, `--cli --help`, and `--tui --help`, asserting each exits 0 and prints that mode's usage banner (which also proves the launcher resolved and loaded the right client build). It's the cheap dispatch check before the heavier prod smokes below.
- `smoke:web` (`scripts/smoke-web.mjs`) starts `mcp-inspector --web` (prod, no `--dev`) against the built `clients/web/dist` and asserts `GET /` serves the SPA (HTTP 200) with the injected `__INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN__`. Prod `--web` serves from `clients/web/dist`, which ships in the published package but is absent in a fresh checkout — the runner builds it on demand (`build:client` = `vite build`) on first launch, or exits with an actionable error if that build can't run (see `clients/web/server/ensure-web-build.ts` and the launcher README). `--dev` runs Vite directly and never needs `dist`. It shares the spawn/readiness/teardown helper (`scripts/lib/prod-web-server.mjs`) with **`smoke:web:browser` and `smoke:web:app`**, so the three can't drift.

  **Every web smoke runs against a throwaway catalog (#1977).** The helper mints a temp dir per run and passes it as `MCP_CATALOG_PATH`; without it the web backend falls back to the developer's real `~/.mcp-inspector/mcp.json`, which made these smokes both destructive and non-deterministic — `smoke:web:app`'s deep link persists a `deep-link` server row, so a *second* run found it already on disk, raced hydration, and drew a spurious (swallowed, non-fatal) 409 that was really just residue from the previous run. CI never saw it: a fresh `HOME` per run made every CI run look like a first run. This matches `smoke:cli` / `smoke:tui`, which have always driven a temp `--catalog`. Only the **catalog** is redirected — other per-user state under `~/.mcp-inspector` (OAuth tokens, `storage/`) stays shared, because isolating it means redirecting `HOME` wholesale, which would also move the npx and Playwright caches these smokes depend on. Teardown uses **both** halves of `scripts/lib/child-cleanup.mjs` (`stopChild` to await the child's exit, then `removeSafe` to delete the dir) — a bare `kill()` only *delivers* the signal, so removing synchronously re-enters the #1801 ENOTEMPTY race. That makes `stop()` **async**, so every caller must `await` it (and a caller's own `fail()`/`shutdown()` becomes async in turn, or execution runs past the intended exit). The isolation contract is unit-tested in `scripts/lib/prod-web-server.test.mjs` via `test:scripts`, since the smokes exit immediately after teardown and so cannot detect a regression that silently reshared the catalog or stopped cleaning up: `createTempCatalog` and `buildWebServerEnv` cover *which* catalog the server gets, and `teardownWebServer` — extracted from `stop()` for exactly this reason — is driven against a stand-in child process so the teardown asserts on the real directory rather than a spy.
- `smoke:web:browser` (`scripts/smoke-web-browser.mjs`, #1615) goes a step further than `smoke:web`: it boots the same prod `--web` server and then actually **runs** the bundle in headless Chromium (Playwright — already a `clients/web` devDependency for the Storybook tests), asserting the app renders its first meaningful frame (the "Add Servers" control) with **no uncaught error**. `smoke:web` only checks the served HTML, so a Node built-in reaching the browser bundle slipped through it; this smoke catches that regression as a _class_ (e.g. #1612). The mechanism is the uncaught error, not a magic string: under Vite the excluded module becomes an empty stub and the first _call_ into it (e.g. `fs.readFileSync(...)` during a transitive module's init) throws a `TypeError` that aborts app mount. A _synchronous_ such throw fires `pageerror`; its _async_ twin (the same `TypeError` via `await`/`.then()`, or a failed dynamic import) is logged on the console channel as `Uncaught (in promise) …` / `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module` — the smoke hard-fails on both. The literal `Module "…" has been externalized` text is, **in a prod build**, a build-time warning (`vite build` / `npm run build`), not a runtime message, so the browser never sees it (under `npm run dev` Vite's stub is instead a `Proxy` that `console.warn`s that string at runtime); and an externalized import that is never _called_ ships a harmless `{}` and is invisible here by design. Every _other_ console error is printed as a diagnostic, not a failure (so a benign font-CDN or React-warning `console.error` doesn't flake CI). Playwright is resolved via `createRequire` based at `clients/web/package.json` — a bare `import("playwright")` would resolve relative to `scripts/`, not the cwd, so it can't be reached that way (it only appears to work when an ancestor `node_modules` carries playwright, and fails in CI, which has none). The npm script's `cd clients/web` exists only so `npx playwright install chromium` finds the local playwright bin (a no-op when already installed).
- `smoke:web:app` (`scripts/smoke-web-app.mjs`, #1859) goes one step further again: `smoke:web:browser` stops at first paint and never connects to a server, so the Apps tab, the sandbox controller, and the UI-protocol bridge were unexercised by any smoke. This one boots the same prod `--web` server, spawns the `mcp-app-http.json` composable test server (the `mcp_app_demo` tool + its `mcp_app_demo_widget` UI resource), and drives the whole **connect → open app → widget ready** chain through a single deep-link navigate (`?serverUrl=…&autoConnect=<token>&openApp=…&appArgs=…&autoOpen=<token>`). The assertion is the `data-app-status="ready"` contract from [clients/web/README.md](clients/web/README.md) — the renderer reports `ready` only once the widget has loaded inside the sandbox iframe _and_ fired `notifications/initialized` back through the bridge, so one attribute covers the sandbox proxy being served, the UI resource loading, and the handshake completing. Two mechanics are load-bearing and easy to get wrong: the test server announces readiness on **stderr** (`console.error` in `server-composable.ts`), so both child streams are piped and scanned — watching stdout alone times out with an empty diagnostic; and its bound port is **not** the config's, because `createTestServerHttp` resolves through `findAvailablePort()`, which walks upward when the configured port is taken — so the smoke parses the announced URL rather than assuming `3130`. **Scope note:** this runs against the repo build tree like every other smoke, so it would _not_ have caught #1859 itself (a packaging failure — the file is always present in-repo); `pack:verify` owns that dimension. It does carry a cheap structural pre-check that the proxy page exists at the path `sandbox-controller.ts` resolves, so a move/rename fails fast with a clear cause instead of an opaque render timeout.
- **The build gate for the browser-externalized-builtin class (#1769)** is the earlier, more complete companion to `smoke:web:browser`. A Vite plugin in `clients/web/vite.config.ts` (logic in `clients/web/server/browser-externalized-builtin-gate.ts`, unit-tested) turns Vite 8's _browser-externalization warning_ (`Module "node:*" has been externalized for browser compatibility`) into a hard `vite build` error, so a Node built-in in the browser graph now **fails `npm run build` / `validate`** instead of shipping a `{}` stub. This catches **both** the _called-at-init_ case (which `smoke:web:browser` also catches, but later/at runtime) **and** the _imported-but-never-called_ case (the `{}` stub that is invisible to the runtime smoke "by design" — see above). Because rolldown **swallows a throw inside `onLog`** (the one hook where a thrown error doesn't abort — verified against vite@8.0.0), the plugin _records_ the warning in `onLog` and re-throws in `buildEnd`. There is **no stable log `code`**, so the gate keys off the documented message phrasing; `npm run verify:build-gate` (`scripts/verify-build-gate.mjs`, in `npm run ci` and the GitHub workflow) runs a real build with a `node:fs` probe forced into `src/main.tsx` and asserts the build fails via the gate — the only check that catches the message phrasing **drifting** in a future Vite bump and silently disabling the gate. The gate is scoped to `vite build` (`apply: 'build'`) — never `vite dev` or the vitest projects — **and** to the browser (`client`) environment (`applyToEnvironment`), so a future SSR/node environment built from this config isn't failed for a legitimate `node:*` import; the Node runner build (tsup, `build:runner`) is a separate config where built-ins are legitimate. `smoke:web:browser` stays as the runtime backstop for crashes the build can't reason about.
- `smoke:cli` (`scripts/smoke-cli.mjs`) drives `mcp-inspector --cli` through the built launcher against the bundled stdio test server via a temp `--catalog`: it asserts `tools/list` returns the server's tools (real connect over stdio), the default writable catalog is seeded empty on first run, a missing read-only `--config` errors without seeding, and `--catalog` + `--config` is rejected. `smoke:tui` (`scripts/smoke-tui.mjs`) launches `mcp-inspector --tui --catalog <temp>` and asserts the Ink app renders its first frame (the "MCP Servers" panel) within a timeout, then SIGTERMs it — a shallow boot/render check, not full interaction. **`smoke:tui` is local-only: it self-skips when `process.env.CI` is set**, because the Ink TUI needs a real TTY (raw mode) that headless CI lacks — so run it (via `npm run smoke`) on your own machine before pushing. Both build `test-servers/build` on demand if it's missing.
- Storybook play-function tests (`clients/web` `test:storybook`) run in headless Chromium via `@vitest/browser-playwright` (~10s). They are part of `npm run ci` (which installs Playwright chromium first); kept out of `validate` because they need the browser binary and are slower than the unit suite.

### Build output is never a gate target

**No gate — lint, format, or typecheck — may read generated output.** The gated surface is first-party source only: `clients/*/src`, `clients/*/__tests__`, `clients/web/{server,.storybook}`, each client's top-level configs, `core/`, `test-servers/src`, `scripts/`, and the root shared files. Everything a build writes is out of scope: `clients/*/build` (the tsup/tsc bundles), `clients/web/dist` (the Vite SPA), `clients/web/storybook-static`, `clients/*/coverage`, `test-servers/build`, `core/**/{build,dist}`, and any `*.tsbuildinfo`. Each scope states this itself — `globalIgnores([...])` in every `eslint.config.js`, the `format`/`format:check` globs in each `package.json`, and a tsconfig `include` that names source directories rather than the package root.

Why it matters, given that these paths are all gitignored and the findings are usually warnings:

- **It reports defects nobody can fix.** A bundle vendors third-party code, so a rule that fires inside it names a problem in someone else's source. `clients/web` shipped this for a while: `build` was missing from its `globalIgnores` while its three sibling clients had it, so the client's *only* lint output was an unused-`eslint-disable` warning from inside the vendored `undici` (#2043).
- **A warning becomes a gate failure without warning.** `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` is a warning by default and a rule promotion — or any new rule a bundled dependency happens to trip — turns it into a `validate` failure on a file nobody wrote. #1959 (enabling `no-floating-promises` across all five scopes) is exactly that kind of change.
- **It trains people to skim the channel.** A scope whose lint is never clean has no signal left in it, and the real warning added later lands where everyone has learned to look past.
- **It is wasted work on every run.** `lint` runs inside `validate`, the fast inner-loop check, and the web runner bundle alone is ~1.2MB of generated JS.

The two coverage guards do **not** catch this, and adding a third is not the fix. `verify:format-coverage` and `verify:typecheck-coverage` assert that first-party source is *covered*; neither asserts that generated output is *excluded* — an asymmetry that is deliberate, since a guard can't distinguish "generated" from "source" without being told, and the ignore lists are already that statement. So this class drifts silently and the check is a human one: **when a build starts writing to a new location, add it to that scope's ignore list in the same change.** The reverse of the guards' rule also holds — never widen an ignore to silence a finding in first-party code, and never add a build directory to a tsconfig `include` to make a generated `.d.ts` resolve (import the source, or fix the build's types).

### Typescript instructions

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow TypeScript best practices and coding standards
- NEVER use 'any' as a type
- NEVER suppress error types (e.g., no-unused-vars, no-explicit-any) in the typescript or eslint configuration as a way of satisfying the linter or compiler.
- AVOID double casts (`as unknown as T`). They erase all type safety and usually signal that the real type is being worked around. Prefer a type guard, a narrower single `as` cast, or fixing the underlying type. When a double cast is genuinely unavoidable (e.g. a documented gap in a third-party type, or bridging a structurally-identical shape TS can't relate), it MUST carry an inline comment justifying why it is safe and why no better option exists — an unjustified `as unknown as` is not acceptable in review.
- Utilize type annotations and interfaces to improve code clarity and maintainability
- Leverage TypeScript's type inference and static analysis features for better code quality and refactoring
- Use type guards and type assertions to handle potential type mismatches and ensure type safety
- Take advantage of TypeScript's advanced features like generics, type aliases, and conditional types to write more expressive and reusable code
- Regularly review and refactor TypeScript code to ensure it remains well-structured and adheres to evolving best practices
- **NEVER leave a promise floating.** `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` is enabled at `error` in **all five** ESLint scopes — `clients/{web,cli,tui,launcher}` and the root `core/` + shared gate (#1959). Every promise must be awaited, returned, terminated with `.catch(…)`, or explicitly discarded with the `void` operator.
  - **The class it catches is invisible at review time.** A floated call reads like an awaited one minus four characters, and the unhandled rejection it produces surfaces somewhere else entirely — a different test, a different file, a stack pointing at SDK internals. Two un-held `client.callTool(...)` promises made `npm run ci` unpassable in #1947: `disconnect()` rejected them with `Connection closed`, the unhandled rejection failed the whole vitest run, and the chain aborted at `coverage`, silently skipping `verify:build-gate`, `smoke`, and Storybook. Attributing it took a full investigation; the fix was two lines.
  - **Prefer holding and settling the promise.** `void` is an escape hatch, not a fix — it is visible at review time (strictly better than nothing) but still discards the rejection. Reach for it only when the callee already owns its failures (it ends in a `catch` that surfaces the message) or the caller genuinely cannot await — a synchronous `useEffect` body, an Ink `useInput` key handler, a Hono `stream.onAbort` listener. Say **which** of those it is in a one-line comment; an unexplained `void` is a review finding. Where the callee does *not* own its failures, give it a `catch` rather than voiding the call (see `handleDisconnect` in `clients/tui/src/App.tsx`), or terminate with `.catch(…)` at the call site (see `open(url)` in `clients/web/server/{server,vite-hono-plugin}.ts`).
  - **In Storybook play functions, `expect(...)` from `storybook/test` returns a promise.** Storybook instruments it so the interactions panel can trace each assertion, so every `expect` in a play function is awaited — as is any shared helper that wraps one (`src/test/scrollAreaStoryAssertions.ts` is `async` for this reason).
  - **The rule is type-aware, so each scope's ESLint config carries a parser project.** Each client's config must name **every leaf project covering its lint surface**, since the parser needs a program that literally *contains* the file — for cli, tui, and launcher that is the two they already typecheck (`tsconfig.json` + `tsconfig.test.json`, `src` in the first and `__tests__` only in the second), and for **web it is four** (`tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, `tsconfig.storybook.json`, `tsconfig.test.json`) — web's `tsconfig.json` is a solution file with `files: []`, so naming it alone would contain nothing. Adding a leaf project to a client means adding it here too. The root config instead points at **`tsconfig.lint.json`**, which exists solely to give the parser a program covering `core/**`, `test-servers/src/**`, and `vitest.shared.mts` — none of which is rooted in a tsconfig of its own. That file emits nothing and gates nothing: type *checking* for those sources stays where it was (`core/` through `clients/web`'s `tsc -b`, `test-servers/src` through `clients/cli`'s test project). It sets `moduleResolution: bundler` deliberately — `core/` uses extensionless relative imports, which NodeNext fails to resolve, degrading every import to `any` so the rule silently stops seeing promises at all. **Its `include` must stay a superset of the root config's type-aware `files` globs** — a file the lint block matches but the project omits fails outright with "was not found in any of the provided project(s)" rather than being checked, so widening one means widening the other (that is why the `include` carries `test-servers/src/**/*.tsx`, which nothing has produced yet). Note also that a tsconfig `include` does **not** expand braces — `core/**/*.{ts,tsx}` matches nothing; list the extensions separately.
  - Type-aware linting costs real time: `clients/web`'s `eslint .` went from ~8s to ~19s, and `lint` runs inside `validate`, the fast inner-loop check. That is the price of the guarantee; if it needs reducing later, narrowing the projects each scope loads is the lever, not dropping the rule.

## Web source layout: `src/lib` vs `src/utils`

The web client keeps two grab-bag directories under `clients/web/src`, split by a real (now codified) rule — **`utils` = functions that compute; `lib` = things that instantiate, adapt, or touch the environment.** If it does I/O or wraps a subsystem, it's `lib`; if it's a pure transform, it's `utils`.

- **`src/utils/`** — pure, side-effect-free functions. Input → output, no DOM/browser/storage I/O, no subsystem ownership. Trivially unit-testable with no mocks. (Anchors: `jsonUtils`, `schemaUtils`, `toolUtils`, `maskSecrets`, `inspectorTabs`, `deepLink`, `mcpNetworkHeaders`.) Carve-outs that are still `utils`:
  - _Domain types._ Pure **shared domain types plus their pure constructors/transforms** live here (`customHeaders` — `CustomHeader` + `headersToRecord`/`migrateFromLegacyAuth`, a shape staged for `ServerSettingsForm`, see `specification/v2_ux_interfaces_plan.md`, so it currently has no importer but its own test). There is no `types/` sub-bucket **inside** `lib`/`utils` — removing `lib/types/` is what the `customHeaders` move settles.
  - _Diagnostic logging._ `console.warn`/`console.error` does **not** count as a side effect for this rule — a validator that warns on bad input is still "pure" here (`sandbox-csp`, `jsonUtils`, `schemaUtils` all warn).
  - _Importing from `@inspector/core`._ Two forms are fine: a **type-only** import is not a subsystem dependency (`pendingReauth` is pure type declarations), and **re-exporting pure functions or constants** from core is not subsystem ownership either (`oauthUx`/`oauthFlow` re-export core copy/predicates). What makes a module `lib` is wrapping core's _stateful runtime_, not merely importing from it.
- **`src/lib/`** — infrastructure / integration / stateful adapters. Modules that instantiate or compose subsystems, wrap the `@inspector/core` **runtime** (not just its types), touch the DOM / `window` / `sessionStorage`, or otherwise produce side effects. (Anchors: `environmentFactory` composes `InspectorClientEnvironment`; `remoteOAuthStorage` is an adapter class over `core/auth`; `oauthResume` reads/writes `sessionStorage`; `browserTabVisibility` registers `visibilitychange` listeners; `clearServerOAuthState` drives the live `InspectorClient` / `OAuthStorage`; `downloadFile` triggers browser downloads.)

The top-level **`src/types/`** is a sibling of both and is not the place for new domain types — it's now purely the home for ambient `.d.ts` module stubs (e.g. the `react-syntax-highlighter` shims wired through `tsconfig.app.json` `paths`). The last plain-`.ts` domain type there, the dead `navigation.ts` `InspectorTab`, was removed in #1785, so a pure domain type belongs in `utils/`, not `src/types/`.

Cross-directory imports point **one way, `lib → utils`** (infra depends on pure helpers, never the reverse). Keep it that way: if a `utils/` module needs a type currently exported from a `lib/` module, declare the type in `utils/` and re-export it from `lib/` (as `pendingReauth` owns `OAuthResumeAuthKind` and `oauthResume` re-exports it), rather than importing "up" from `utils` into `lib`.

Nothing **enforces** the boundary: no path alias keys off it, and the coverage `include` in `clients/web/vite.config.ts` lists **both** `src/lib/**` and `src/utils/**`, so a move between them is coverage-neutral (this is why the refactor was gate-safe). It's a human-legible signal at import time, valuable in a codebase this test-heavy (the ≥90% per-file gate). Note that `include` is a **whitelist** — it names `components`/`hooks`/`theme`/`lib`/`utils`/`server` (plus the `core/*` runtime; `hooks` and `theme` were added in #1787), so a module placed **outside** those directories (`types/`, `App.tsx`, or a brand-new grab-bag) falls out of the ≥90 gate entirely, silently. The **deliberate, documented** top-level-file exceptions are `src/App.tsx` — a ~4.5k-line composition root at ~42% branch coverage (gating it is a dedicated testing/decomposition effort, not a whitelist tweak) — and the `src/main.tsx` / `src/index.ts` bootstraps (browser `createRoot` render and the bin `runWeb` re-export, the analog of `clients/cli`'s excluded `src/index.ts`). All three are called out in a comment on the `include` array itself rather than left silent. When adding a module, place it by the rule and keep it inside a gated directory; when it genuinely mixes both (e.g. `downloadFile` bundles DOM-side-effect helpers with a couple of pure ones), keep it whole on its dominant side (`lib`) rather than splitting hairs.

## React instructions

- UI Components
  - We are using the Mantine component library for UI.
  - Instructions are at https://mantine.dev/llms.txt
  - Avoid using div and other basic HTML elements for layout purposes.
  - Prefer Mantine's Box, Group, and Stack components for layout.
  - Use Mantine's theme and styling utilities to ensure a consistent and responsive design.
  - NEVER use inline styles on a component.
  - NEVER use raw hex values (`#ddd`, `#94a3b8`, etc.) or `rgba()` literals for colors in component props or theme files. Use `--inspector-*` CSS custom properties defined in `App.css :root` (e.g., `c: 'var(--inspector-text-primary)'`). If no existing token fits, add one to `:root` first.
  - NEVER add a CSS class to a Mantine component when the styles can instead be expressed as component props or a theme variant. CSS classes are a last resort.
  - PREFER component props (via `.withProps()`) to CSS for behavioral and visual styles.
  - PREFER defining styles as theme variants (via `Component.extend()` in `src/theme/<Component>.ts`) over CSS classes. Each Mantine component with custom variants has its own file in `src/theme/`, exporting a `Theme<Name>` constant. The barrel `src/theme/index.ts` re-exports them all and `theme.ts` imports from the barrel. Flat CSS properties (margin, padding, background, border, color, font-size, etc.) belong in the theme. Only pseudo-selectors, nested child selectors, keyframes, and native HTML element styles belong in App.css.
  - App.css must contain ONLY styles that cannot be expressed in the Mantine theme: `@keyframes`, pseudo-selectors (`:hover`, `:focus`), cross-component hover relationships, nested child-element selectors for third-party HTML output (e.g. ReactMarkdown), and styles for native HTML elements (`img`, `iframe`). When refactoring a component, actively move any flat CSS properties out of App.css and into theme variants or `.withProps()` constants.
  - NEVER use inline code; instead extract to functions in the same file, exported or located in a shared location if immediately reusable.
  - In a component's file, for sub-components:
    - ALWAYS use Mantine components for layout and content, configured with props for styling and behavior.
    - ALWAYS declare a meaningfully named subcomponent as a constant using `.withProps()` if an inline Mantine element carries two or more **static** props. A _static_ prop is one whose value is a literal that configures the element's **styling, layout, or behavior** (`size="sm"`, `c="dimmed"`, `fw={500}`, `gap="xs"`, `justify="space-between"`, `variant="light"`, `withBorder`, `readOnly`, `striped`, …); dynamic props (`value`, `onChange`/`on*`, `children`, `key`, `ref`, and anything whose value is a variable/expression) do **not** count toward the two and are passed at the call site, not baked into the constant. Purely per-instance **content/accessibility** literals — `label`, `description`, `placeholder`, `title`, `aria-label`, `role` — likewise do **not** count toward the two (a `<Checkbox label="…" description="…">` with no styling/layout/behavior props stays inline); they may be baked into a constant when it already qualifies and doing so aids reuse, but they never by themselves trigger extraction. This rule applies in **all** cases: "repeated pattern" is NOT the bar — a single-use element with two or more static styling/layout/behavior props must still be extracted. Bake the static props into the `.withProps()` constant and pass the dynamic ones where it's rendered.
    - The following **cannot** be expressed via `.withProps()` and so stay inline (like `Box` below), each with a one-line comment saying why: **`Accordion`** (a compound, `multiple`-discriminated generic — `.withProps({ multiple: true, … })` loses its JSX call signature and fails to type); **headless, non-`factory()` Mantine components** such as **`Transition`** (plain function components with no Styles API — they have no `.withProps` static at all, e.g. `Transition.withProps` is a TS2339); and **`data-*` attributes** (not part of a component's typed props object, so excess-property-checked out of a `withProps` literal — pass them at the call site). The rule targets factory-based (Styles-API) Mantine components; anything that isn't one is out of scope entirely — a third-party element (a `react-icons` glyph, another library's component) **and** a first-party component that isn't a Mantine factory (a dumb `export function` like `ContentViewer`, which has no `.withProps` static of its own).
    - NEVER use `Box` for subcomponent constants — `Box` does not support `.withProps()`. Use `Group`, `Stack`, `Flex`, `Text`, `Paper`, `UnstyledButton`, or `Image` instead. Pick the component that best matches the purpose: `Paper` for bordered/surfaced containers, `Text` for any text or content wrapper, `Stack`/`Group`/`Flex` for layout. A `Box` that genuinely needs a non-flex primitive it can't provide — `component="iframe"`, or `display="grid"` (no Mantine flex primitive is a CSS grid) — stays a `Box` inline, with a one-line comment saying why.
    - NEVER use a CSS class on a subcomponent constant when the styles can be expressed as a Mantine theme variant instead. Define variants in `src/theme/<Component>.ts` using `Component.extend({ styles: (_theme, props) => { ... } })` and reference them with `variant="variantName"` on the component or in `.withProps()`.
    - CSS classes are ONLY acceptable on subcomponents for styles that cannot be expressed as flat CSS-in-JS properties in the theme — specifically: pseudo-selectors (`:hover`, `:focus`), cross-component hover relationships (`.parent:hover .child`), nested child-element selectors (`.wrapper p`, `.wrapper code`), `@keyframes` definitions, and native HTML elements (`img`, `iframe`) that are not Mantine components.
    - When a theme variant needs a CSS class for nested/pseudo selectors, use `classNames` in the theme extension to auto-assign it — never add `className` manually in JSX for theme-styled components.
    - Example — subcomponent constant with `withProps`:
    ```tsx
    const CardContent = Group.withProps({
      flex: 1,
      align: "flex-start",
      justify: "space-between",
      wrap: "nowrap",
    });
    return <CardContent> ... </CardContent>;
    ```
    - Example — theme variant with auto-assigned className for nested selectors:
    ```tsx
    // src/theme/Paper.ts
    export const ThemePaper = Paper.extend({
      classNames: (_theme, props) => {
        if (props.variant === "message") return { root: "message" };
        return {};
      },
      styles: (_theme, props) => {
        if (props.variant === "message") {
          return { root: { padding: "1.5rem", borderRadius: 12 } };
        }
        return { root: {} };
      },
    });

    // Component.tsx
    const MessageContainer = Paper.withProps({ variant: "message" });
    ```
- State and effects
  - **NEVER reset or re-sync local state from a prop inside a `useEffect`.** `useEffect(() => setX(prop), [prop])` renders once with the stale value, paints it, and only then corrects itself — the user sees the wrong frame and React renders twice. It is an error under `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, which the web client's `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` recommended set enforces.
  - Use **`useValueChange(value, onChange)`** (`clients/web/src/hooks/useValueChange.ts`) instead. It is React's documented ["adjusting state during render"](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders) pattern: it compares `value` against the previous render's with `Object.is` and calls `onChange(next)` during render, so React discards the in-progress output and re-runs the component before anything reaches the DOM. It does **not** fire on the first render — seed the dependent state with `useState` instead. Because the comparison is `Object.is`, the value you pass **must be referentially stable** across renders that mean "no change": prefer a primitive key derived from the data (an id, a name, a URI), and otherwise a memoized value. A fresh object/array literal would compare unequal every render and loop.
  - The `onChange` you pass runs **during render**, so it must be pure — `setState` calls and nothing else. No fetches, DOM writes, logging, ref mutation, or parent callbacks: a render can be replayed (StrictMode) or abandoned (concurrent React), so external work would run an unpredictable number of times.
  - An effect is still the right tool for genuine synchronization with an external system (DOM measurement, `requestAnimationFrame`, subscriptions, timers). The rule is about deriving React state from React props, not about effects in general. `NetworkEntry` shows the split: the reveal's force-open is a state update and uses `useValueChange`, while its `requestAnimationFrame` scroll stays a `useEffect`.
- Theme files vs. Storybook element components
  - **Theme files** (`src/theme/<Component>.ts`) and **element components** (`src/components/elements/`) serve different purposes and both are needed.
  - Theme files customize every instance of a Mantine component app-wide — defaults (size, radius), custom variants, and global style overrides. They are applied automatically by `MantineProvider`.
  - Element components add domain-specific semantics on top of Mantine primitives. For example, `AnnotationBadge` maps domain concepts (audience, destructive, longRun) to Mantine's styling primitives (color, variant). Storybook documents these domain components for designers and developers.
  - Element components MUST import from `@mantine/core`, NOT from `src/theme/`. The theme layer is applied transparently by the provider — elements do not need to know about `Theme<Name>` constants.
  - NEVER push domain-specific variant logic (e.g., annotation types, transport types) into theme files. Domain variants belong in the element component that owns those semantics. Theme files are for styling that applies to the Mantine primitive globally.

## Web backend auth token

The dev/prod web backend protects every `/api/*` route with `x-mcp-remote-auth: Bearer <MCP_INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN>`. The browser recovers that token from three sources, in priority order (see `App.tsx` `getAuthToken()`):

1. `window.__INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN__` — injected into `index.html` on every page load by the backend (the dev Vite plugin via `transformIndexHtml`, the prod Hono server on the `/` route), both routed through `clients/web/server/inject-auth-token.ts`. This is what makes a bare-URL reload, a bookmark, or a cleared `sessionStorage` keep working.
2. `?MCP_INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN=…` query string — the URL the launcher banner prints; kept as a fallback for pasted full URLs.
3. `sessionStorage` — backstop for navigations that land without either of the above.

Injection is a no-op when auth is disabled (`DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH`), and the global name is the shared `INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN_GLOBAL` constant in `core/mcp/remote/constants.ts`.
