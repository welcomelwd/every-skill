## Installation

XcodeBuildMCP ships as a single package with two modes: a **CLI** for direct terminal use and an **MCP server** for AI coding agents. Either install method gives you both.

### Option A — Homebrew

```bash
brew tap getsentry/xcodebuildmcp
brew install xcodebuildmcp
```

### Option B — npm (Node.js 18+)

```bash
npm install -g xcodebuildmcp@latest
```

Verify either install:
```bash
xcodebuildmcp --help
```

### Connect your MCP client

Drop-in config snippets for Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, can be found in the official docs page [MCP Clients](https://xcodebuildmcp.com/docs/clients). Most clients can also run the MCP server on demand via `npx -y xcodebuildmcp@latest mcp` without a global install.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.5 or later
- Xcode 16.x or later
- Node.js 18.x or later (not required for Homebrew installation)

## Skills

XcodeBuildMCP now includes two optional agent skills:

- **MCP Skill**: Primes the agent with instructions on how to use the MCP server's tools (optional when using the MCP server).

- **CLI Skill**: Primes the agent with instructions on how to navigate the CLI (recommended when using the CLI).


To install with a global binary:

```bash
xcodebuildmcp init
```

Or install directly via npx without a global install:

```bash
npx -y xcodebuildmcp@latest init
```

For further information on installing skills, see [Agent Skills](https://xcodebuildmcp.com/docs/skills).

## Notes

- XcodeBuildMCP requests xcodebuild to skip macro validation to avoid errors when building projects that use Swift Macros.
- Device tools require code signing to be configured in Xcode. See [Device Code Signing](https://xcodebuildmcp.com/docs/device-signing).

## Privacy

XcodeBuildMCP uses Sentry for internal runtime error telemetry only. For details and opt-out instructions, see [Privacy & Telemetry](https://xcodebuildmcp.com/docs/privacy).

## CLI

XcodeBuildMCP provides a unified command-line interface. The `mcp` subcommand starts the MCP server, while all other commands provide direct terminal access to tools:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g xcodebuildmcp@latest

# Start the MCP server (for MCP clients)
xcodebuildmcp mcp

# List available tools
xcodebuildmcp tools

# Build for simulator
xcodebuildmcp simulator build --scheme MyApp --project-path ./MyApp.xcodeproj

# Prepare portable test products without running tests
xcodebuildmcp simulator build --scheme MyApp --project-path ./MyApp.xcodeproj --simulator-name "iPhone 17" --build-for-testing --test-products-path ./MyApp.xctestproducts

# Run previously prepared test products
xcodebuildmcp simulator test --test-products-path ./MyApp.xctestproducts --simulator-name "iPhone 17"
```

Check for updates and upgrade in place:

```bash
xcodebuildmcp upgrade --check
xcodebuildmcp upgrade --yes
```

The CLI uses a per-workspace daemon for stateful operations (log capture, debugging, etc.) that auto-starts when needed. See the [CLI guide](https://xcodebuildmcp.com/docs/cli) for full documentation.
