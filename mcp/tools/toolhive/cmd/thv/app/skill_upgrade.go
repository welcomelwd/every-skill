Skills pinned to an immutable reference (an OCI digest or a full git commit
hash) are reported not-upgradable — there is nothing newer to resolve to.
Use --preview to see what would change without persisting anything (OCI
sources are still fetched into the local artifact store to compare digests),
and --allow-ref-change to permit the artifact moving to a different
repository (a version bump within the same repository is not a change
this guard blocks).
--fail-on-changes evaluates the same plan and never installs: it is a CI
freshness gate.

Unless --preview is set, upgrade prompts for confirmation before installing —
skill content is a set of AI-followed instructions. Pass --yes to skip the
prompt (required in non-interactive contexts such as CI).`,
