# External Subject-Token Exchange (Delegation)

This document covers the embedded authorization server's RFC 8693 token-exchange
grant when the `subject_token` comes from an external, trusted OIDC issuer
(`trustedIssuers`). It is unrelated to the *outgoing* token exchange described in
docs [02](02-core-concepts.md), [04](04-secrets-management.md),
[05](05-runconfig-and-permissions.md), [09](09-operator-architecture.md), and
[10](10-virtual-mcp-architecture.md), where `MCPExternalAuthConfig` middleware
exchanges a client's token for an upstream IdP token. Here the server is the
token *issuer*, accepting an externally-minted token as proof of identity and
re-issuing a ToolHive-scoped delegated token.

Normally the grant accepts only the server's own self-issued tokens as
`subject_token`. `trustedIssuers` extends that to tokens minted by an external
IdP (e.g. a corporate IdP), so a client already holding a token from that IdP
can exchange it for a ToolHive delegated token without a separate ToolHive
login.

## Deployment and configuration

RFC 8693 is reachable through a pre-provisioned **delegate client**. A delegate
client is a confidential client registered when the embedded authorization server
starts. It is limited to the token-exchange grant and authenticates at
`/oauth/token` with `client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post`.

### RunConfig

`RunConfig.delegate_clients` is the portable runtime configuration surface. Each
client must name a unique `client_id`, a secret **reference**, one or more scopes,
and one or more audiences. The grant type is fixed internally to
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange` and is not configurable.
Scopes must be a subset of `scopes_supported` (or the default supported OIDC
scopes when that field is omitted), and audiences must be a subset of
`allowed_audiences`. These required narrowing lists prevent a delegate client
from inheriting every server scope or resource.

The following is a relevant `RunConfig` excerpt. `client_secret_env_var` may be
replaced by `client_secret_file`; an inline secret is not supported. Generate
the secret with a CSPRNG, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`.

```yaml
issuer: https://auth.example.com
scopes_supported: [openid, profile]
allowed_audiences: [https://mcp.example.com]
delegate_clients:
  - client_id: reporting-delegate
    client_secret_env_var: REPORTING_DELEGATE_CLIENT_SECRET
    scopes: [openid]
    audiences: [https://mcp.example.com]
trusted_issuers:
  - issuer_url: https://login.example-idp.com
    expected_audience: https://mcp.example.com
    allowed_actors: [external-reporting-client]
    allowed_delegate_clients: [reporting-delegate]
```

`trusted_issuers` remains a `RunConfig`-only surface. It is needed only when
subject tokens originate at an external issuer; a configured delegate client can
also exchange a self-issued subject token. See [Trust model](#trust-model) for
the required external-issuer binding.

### Kubernetes operator

The operator exposes delegate clients on the shared
`EmbeddedAuthServerConfig`, which has two supported consumers:

- `MCPExternalAuthConfig.spec.embeddedAuthServer.delegateClients`, for an
  embedded authorization server referenced by an `MCPServer` or
  `MCPRemoteProxy`.
- `VirtualMCPServer.spec.authServerConfig.delegateClients`, for a vMCP's inline
  embedded authorization server.

The following `MCPExternalAuthConfig` excerpt declares the same client. The
operator converts the Secret reference into a pod environment-variable reference
and always supplies the token-exchange grant; it does not copy the secret into
the generated ConfigMap or `RunConfig`.

```yaml
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1beta1
kind: MCPExternalAuthConfig
metadata:
  name: embedded-auth
spec:
  type: embeddedAuthServer
  embeddedAuthServer:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com
    # Other required embedded-auth-server fields, including upstreamProviders,
    # are omitted here.
    delegateClients:
      - clientId: reporting-delegate
        clientSecretRef:
          name: reporting-delegate-secret
          key: client-secret
        scopes: [openid]
        audiences: [https://mcp.example.com]
```

For a `VirtualMCPServer`, place the list under `spec.authServerConfig`:

```yaml
apiVersion: toolhive.stacklok.dev/v1beta1
kind: VirtualMCPServer
metadata:
  name: reporting-gateway
spec:
  # Other required VirtualMCPServer fields are omitted here.
  authServerConfig:
    issuer: https://auth.example.com
    # Other required embedded-auth-server fields, including upstreamProviders,
    # are omitted here.
    delegateClients:
      - clientId: reporting-delegate
        clientSecretRef:
          name: reporting-delegate-secret
          key: client-secret
        scopes: [openid]
        audiences: [https://mcp.example.com]
```

The CRD accepts Secret references only: no plaintext secret, redirect URI, or
arbitrary grant selection is available. A non-empty `clientSecretRef.name` and
`.key`, at least one scope, and at least one audience are required. Delegate
clients require an HTTPS issuer at admission.

Static delegate clients and confidential Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) are
independent. Declaring `delegateClients` neither enables nor requires
`allowConfidentialClientRegistration`; the latter governs unauthenticated
`/oauth/register` requests. If a persisted DCR client has the same ID as a
static delegate client, the static client is registered at server startup and
replaces the DCR registration, including its secret and permissions. Do not
reuse IDs between the two mechanisms.

### Discovery and secret rotation

Both `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` and
`/.well-known/openid-configuration` advertise the token-exchange grant in
`grant_types_supported`. When confidential DCR is enabled **or** at least one
static delegate client is configured, they also advertise
`client_secret_basic` and `client_secret_post` in
`token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`; otherwise only `none` is advertised.

On Kubernetes, a delegate-client Secret is injected as a pod environment
variable and is resolved when the authorization server starts. Updating that
Secret does not change the environment of an already running pod. The operator
has no delegate-client Secret watch or automatic rollout for this feature, so
restart or otherwise roll out the workload after rotating the secret.

## Trust model

A trusted issuer plus a matching audience and a valid signature only proves
the token was minted for ToolHive to consume — it authorizes ToolHive as a
*resource*, not any particular *client* as a delegate. Accepting the token on
that basis alone would let any client presenting a validly-signed token
exchange it: a confused-deputy risk (CWE-863). The handler therefore requires
an explicit consent signal before treating the request as an authorized
delegation.

## Consent signals

Two functions cooperate here. `resolveAllowedActor`
(`pkg/authserver/server/tokenexchange/multi_issuer_validator.go`), called from
`validateExternalToken` during signature/claim validation, checks the
external-issuer allowlist and — when it matches — sets
`ValidatedClaims.ExternalActor`. `checkDelegationConsent`
(`pkg/authserver/server/tokenexchange/handler.go`) runs afterwards and decides
whether to grant the exchange, in this order:

1. **`may_act` (RFC 8693 §4.4).** If the subject token carries a well-formed
   `may_act` claim, it is authoritative: the allowlist step above is skipped
   entirely (`validateExternalToken` never calls `resolveAllowedActor` when
   `may_act` is present), and `checkDelegationConsent` enforces `may_act.sub`
   against the authenticated ToolHive client. A malformed `may_act` is
   rejected outright by `validateMayActShape`, not silently ignored or
   fallen through to the allowlist. On the external path, `may_act.iss` is
   mandatory, not merely constrained when present as on the self-issued path
   — `validateMayActShape`'s `requireIss` parameter is `true` there. Without
   this, an external issuer omitting `iss` could authorize any ToolHive
   client by naming its ID in a bare `may_act.sub`, bypassing
   `allowedActors`/`allowedDelegateClients` entirely — the one consent path
   that does.
2. **`ExternalActor`.** Otherwise, consent was already established by
   `resolveAllowedActor`: the claim named by that issuer's `actorClaim`
   (default `azp`; `appid` for Microsoft Entra v1, `cid` for Okta) matched an
   entry in that issuer's `allowedActors`. `allowedActors` holds client IDs in
   the *external* IdP's namespace, not ToolHive client IDs — the likeliest
   misconfiguration. An empty `allowedActors` accepts only `may_act`-bearing
   tokens from that issuer. `checkDelegationConsent` then additionally checks
   the issuer's `allowedDelegateClients` against the authenticated ToolHive
   client — this field is required (see below), so the check always applies
   on this path.
3. **`client_id` binding.** For a self-issued subject token (not part of the
   external path above), the token's `client_id` must match the authenticated
   client — **unless** the authenticated client is a configured delegate
   client (`Handler.configuredDelegateClients`, sourced from
   `Config.DelegateClients`), in which case the binding is skipped and any
   self-issued subject token is accepted regardless of which client it was
   originally issued to. This exception applies only on the self-issued path
   (`ExternalIssuer == ""`); a delegate client presenting an externally-issued
   token with a mismatched `client_id` is still rejected here.
4. **No binding.** If none of the above apply, the token carries no
   verifiable client binding and the exchange is rejected.

### Delegate clients and self-issued token exchange

A configured delegate client can convert *any* self-issued ToolHive access
token it can obtain — for any user, regardless of which client originally
obtained that token — into a delegated token asserting that user's `sub`.
This is an intentional blanket-trust model, not an oversight: delegate
clients are declared by the operator at server startup (`RunConfig`/CRD),
not obtained through self-service registration, so the same trust already
placed in them by granting the token-exchange grant extends to any
self-issued subject token rather than only ones issued to that specific
client.

The relaxation is bounded the same way every other exchange is: `grantScopes`
and `grantAndBoundAudiences`'s `ensureAudienceSubsetOfSubject` still narrow
the delegated token to what both the delegate client and the subject token
are authorized for, and the delegated token's lifetime is still capped by
`min(subject token's remaining lifetime, configured delegationLifespan)`.
It is **not** bounded by per-`jti` single-use enforcement — there is none in
this codebase today, for any token-exchange path, self-issued or external
(see the `Handler` doc comment in `handler.go` for why: replay is bounded by
lifetime, not single-use tracking, pending the broader M2M/sender-constrained-
token effort).

Revoking a delegate client (removing it from config) revokes this specific
relaxation for that client on the next server restart — it does **not**
retroactively delete the client's already-registered row, its hashed secret,
or its token-exchange grant from storage. No `DeleteClient` path exists in
this codebase today; that is a separate, pre-existing gap, unrelated to this
relaxation, and not something this change addresses.

RFC 8693 §2.1 permits this: it defines the subject token only as a token
that represents "the identity of the party on behalf of whom the request is
being made," with no requirement that the token be validated against the
identity of the client presenting it as `subject_token`. Applying a
client-authentication-based policy on top of that — as this exception does —
is within the authorization server's discretion as the token-exchange STS.

### Worked example

This is the scenario the relaxation exists for (issue #5194): an interactive
client obtains a self-issued token for a user, and a separate, unrelated
delegate client later exchanges that same token to act as the user.

`RunConfig` declares the delegate client (`chat-ui`, the client the user
authenticated through, needs no entry here — only the delegate does):

```yaml
delegate_clients:
  - client_id: coding-agent
    client_secret_env_var: CODING_AGENT_CLIENT_SECRET
    scopes: [openid, mcp:tools]
    audiences: [https://mcp.example.com]
```

1. The user signs in through `chat-ui` and ToolHive mints a self-issued
   access token whose `client_id` is `chat-ui` — not `coding-agent`:

   ```json
   {
     "iss": "https://auth.example.com",
     "sub": "3f9c2eab-1a4e-4b8f-9c11-3a0d2e6f9d21",
     "client_id": "chat-ui",
     "aud": "https://mcp.example.com",
     "scope": "openid mcp:tools",
     "exp": 1755100000
   }
   ```

2. `coding-agent` — a client the user never signed in through — presents
   that access token as `subject_token`, authenticating itself with its own
   client credentials (`client_secret_basic`, i.e. an `Authorization: Basic`
   header):

   ```http
   POST /oauth/token HTTP/1.1
   Host: auth.example.com
   Authorization: Basic Y29kaW5nLWFnZW50OjxzZWNyZXQ+
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange&
   subject_token=<the access token from step 1>&
   subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token&
   audience=https://mcp.example.com&
   scope=openid
   ```

   Because `coding-agent` is a configured delegate client, `checkDelegationConsent`
   skips the `client_id` binding described in step 3 above — `chat-ui` on the
   subject token is not compared against `coding-agent`, the authenticated
   client — and the exchange proceeds.

3. The delegated token names the same user as `sub`, and records
   `coding-agent` — the client that performed the exchange, not `chat-ui` —
   as the acting party in `act.sub`:

   ```json
   {
     "iss": "https://auth.example.com",
     "sub": "3f9c2eab-1a4e-4b8f-9c11-3a0d2e6f9d21",
     "act": { "sub": "coding-agent" },
     "aud": "https://mcp.example.com",
     "scope": "openid",
     "exp": 1755099400
   }
   ```

   `scope` is narrowed from the requested `openid` to what both `coding-agent`
   and the subject token already carried (`grantScopes` never grows it); had
   the request asked for `mcp:tools` too, the same subset rule would have
   granted it, since the subject token carried it. `aud` passes
   `ensureAudienceSubsetOfSubject` because it's both in the subject token's
   own `aud` and in `coding-agent`'s configured `audiences`. `exp` is capped
   to `min(subject token's remaining lifetime, delegationLifespan)`, which
   here yields an expiry earlier than the subject token's own.

## Accepted limitations

1. **`allowedDelegateClients` binds an allowlisted actor to specific ToolHive
   clients, and is mandatory, not opt-in.** `allowedActors` by itself
   authorizes "this external client's tokens may be exchanged here," not
   "…by this particular ToolHive client" — the external actor claim is never
   compared against the authenticated ToolHive client ID. Without a separate
   binding, every ToolHive confidential client holding the token-exchange
   grant would be delegation-equivalent with respect to an allowlisted
   external actor, so compromise of the weakest such client would be as good
   as compromise of all of them.

   `TrustedIssuer.AllowedDelegateClients` (`allowed_delegate_clients` on a
   hand-written `authserver.RunConfig`) closes this per issuer: a list of
   ToolHive client IDs permitted to use that issuer's allowlisted actors, or
   the wildcard `"*"` to explicitly permit any ToolHive client holding the
   token-exchange grant. `validateTrustedIssuer` rejects the field when it is
   empty or absent — permissiveness must be *declared* with the wildcard, not
   obtained by leaving the field out — and rejects the wildcard combined with
   specific client IDs, since silently ignoring the specific IDs alongside it
   would be worse than rejecting the config outright. `checkDelegationConsent`
   checks the authenticated client against this list on both consent paths:
   `may_act` bypasses `allowedActors` (the external-issuer allowlist) but NOT
   `allowedDelegateClients`, since the validator sets `AllowedDelegateClients`
   for every external token regardless of which path authorized it (see
   limitation 4 below). A self-issued `may_act` (no external issuer involved)
   has no `allowedDelegateClients` equivalent and is unaffected — it remains
   bound by `may_act.sub` alone.

2. **Subject namespace collisions are closed, not accepted.** A trusted
   issuer is trusted to assert *any* subject this server accepts for
   delegation, and downstream authorization decisions (Cedar) key on `sub`
   alone — not `iss`. Rather than requiring operators to keep every issuer's
   subject namespace disjoint, the delegated token's `sub` is qualified as
   `<issuerURL>#<externalSub>` for every trusted-issuer exchange
   (`tokenexchange.delegatedSubject`), never the external `sub` copied
   verbatim. ToolHive's own native subjects are UUIDs minted by
   `UserResolver.ResolveUser`, which cannot contain `#`, so a qualified
   external subject can never collide with one. Scope names are not
   qualified this way and remain the operator's responsibility to keep
   disjoint across issuers.
3. **Provenance is recorded for every external token.** The RFC 8693 §4.1
   `act` claim records who acted: `act.sub` is always the ToolHive client,
   with the external issuer nested one level in — `ValidatedClaims.ExternalIssuer`
   is set for every token validated by the external-issuer path, whether or
   not it also carries `may_act`. The nested entry additionally carries `sub`
   (the allowlisted actor claim) when the allowlist path resolved one;
   a `may_act`-bearing external token yields `act = {sub: <toolhive-client>,
   act: {iss: <external-issuer>}}` — no client-namespace actor to report, but
   the issuer is still recorded. Either way, Cedar authorizers key on `sub`
   and do not read `act` — it is an audit trail, not an access control. (AWS
   STS role mapping can read arbitrary claims including `act` via its CEL
   matcher, so "authorizers" here means Cedar specifically, not every
   consumer.)
4. **A `may_act`-emitting issuer bypasses the allowlist entirely.** Since it
   takes priority and can name any ToolHive client, that claim must be drawn
   from ToolHive's own client namespace and must not be influenceable by an
   untrusted party.
5. **ID/access-token discrimination on the external path rests on two
   partial layers, neither of which is exhaustive alone.** Nothing inspects
   the JWT header's `typ` claim: RFC 8725 §3.12 recommends `typ: at+jwt` for
   access tokens, but Entra v1/v2, Okta, and Google all emit a bare `JWT`
   `typ` for access tokens too, so requiring `at+jwt` would reject those
   providers' genuine access tokens.

   Layer one: `rejectIDTokenClaims` (`validator.go`) rejects a subject token
   carrying `at_hash` or `c_hash` — OIDC Core §3.3.2.11/§3.3.2.10 define both
   for ID tokens only. This is a sound *positive* detector but not
   exhaustive: both claims are OPTIONAL even on a valid
   authorization-code-flow ID token, so an ID token that omits them is not
   caught here.

   Layer two: `TrustedIssuer.ExpectedAudience` is documented as MUST be a
   resource/API identifier and MUST NOT be a client ID, since an ID token's
   `aud` is the requesting client's own ID while an access token's `aud`
   names the resource. This check is operator-dependent, not
   self-enforcing — nothing validates that the operator actually set a
   resource identifier rather than a client ID.
   `NewMultiIssuerTokenValidator` emits a `slog.Warn` at startup
   (`looksLikeResourceIdentifier`) when `expected_audience` has no URI
   scheme (`https://`, `api://`), naming the issuer and the consequence, but
   does not hard-reject it: Entra v1 legitimately uses a bare app-ID GUID
   (no scheme) as an access token's `aud`, so rejecting every non-URI
   audience would break that real, supported provider.

   A third discriminator — rejecting when a subject token's `aud` equals the
   issuer's configured actor claim, since OIDC Core requires an ID token's
   `aud` to equal its own `azp` — was evaluated and not shipped: an app whose
   API and client share one registration (the same ambiguous
   bare-GUID-audience configuration layer two warns about) legitimately
   issues *access* tokens where `aud` and `azp`/`appid` are the same value
   too, so this would reject genuine access tokens from that setup.

   Taken together: an operator who sets `expected_audience` to a client ID
   (despite the startup warning), talking to a real IdP whose ID tokens omit
   `at_hash`/`c_hash` (both legal per OIDC Core), has no remaining
   discriminator here. The blast radius is bounded: an admitted ID token
   carries no `scope`/`scp` claim, so `grantScopes` (`handler.go`) either
   rejects the exchange with `invalid_scope` or grants a zero-scope
   delegated token — it must also be signed by a configured trusted issuer
   and satisfy one of the consent signals above.

## Operational notes

- **Audience.** The requested audience is bounded by the subject token's own
  `aud` claim (`ensureAudienceSubsetOfSubject`); a request for an audience the
  subject token doesn't carry fails with `invalid_target`. An external IdP's
  `aud` is typically an app-ID GUID or `api://<app-id>`. For an exchange to
  succeed, the external IdP's API identifier must be set as the per-issuer
  `expectedAudience` *and* appear in the server's own `allowedAudiences` (plus
  the calling client's registered audiences) — `expectedAudience` alone is not
  enough, since it only governs whether the subject token validates, not what
  the delegated token is granted. A startup WARN fires when `expectedAudience`
  isn't in `allowedAudiences`.
- **Scopes.** `grantScopes` rejects — it does not intersect — any requested
  scope absent from the subject token's granted scopes, with `invalid_scope`.
  Both the RFC 9068 `"scope"` string claim and the `"scp"` array claim are
  read (`"scope"` wins if both are present) — `"scp"` is not an Entra
  quirk, it is what fosite's own default JWT claims strategy writes for a
  self-issued ToolHive access token, so a genuine subject token minted by
  this server's own token endpoint carries scopes this way already.
- **Delegated token lifetime.** `min(subject token's remaining lifetime,
  configured delegationLifespan)`. A short-lived external token silently
  yields a short delegated token.
- **Delegation chain depth.** Re-exchanging an already-delegated token nests
  `act` further; `maxDelegationDepth` (10) bounds it, past which the exchange
  fails with `invalid_grant` ("delegation chain is too deep").
- **Discovery redirects.** The per-issuer HTTP client only follows same-host
  redirects (`networking.SameHostRedirectPolicy()`), so an issuer whose
  `/.well-known/openid-configuration` redirects cross-host cannot be
  onboarded via discovery — set `jwksUrl` explicitly to skip discovery.
- **JWKS caching.** A successful fetch is cached and refreshed by jwx's
  `jwk.Cache` on a schedule driven by the response's `Cache-Control`/`Expires`
  headers (no fixed TTL). The 30-second figure is `jwksFetchFailureBackoff`,
  which gates only how often a persistently-failing issuer is retried before
  its first successful fetch — so a just-corrected `jwksUrl` can keep failing
  for up to 30s before the next retry; once a fetch has ever succeeded, this
  backoff no longer applies.
- **Diagnostics.** A non-allowlisted actor and an untrusted issuer both
  surface as the same generic `invalid_request`
  ("The subject token is invalid or could not be verified."), per RFC 8693
  §2.2.2. The only discriminator is a `slog.Debug` log line, so diagnosing a
  failed exchange needs debug logging enabled. The two exceptions are startup
  `slog.Warn` lines — an issuer with empty `allowedActors`, and an
  `expectedAudience` missing from `allowedAudiences` — the only non-DEBUG
  diagnostics this feature emits.
- **HTTPS enforcement for a trusted issuer.** `validateTrustedIssuerURL`
  (`pkg/authserver/config.go`) validates `issuer_url` at config time and,
  unlike the server's own issuer, grants no localhost exemption: an
  `http://localhost` trusted issuer is rejected unless that issuer's own
  `insecure_allow_http` is set. There is no separate runtime scheme check for
  `issuer_url` — only `jwks_url` gets one (`ValidateJWKSURL`, on every fetch;
  shared verbatim between the runtime choke point and the config-time check
  so the two can't drift). The operator exposes delegate clients, but not
  `trusted_issuers`; external-issuer trust therefore still requires a
  `RunConfig` supplied outside the CRD, while self-issued token exchange is
  fully configurable through the supported delegate-client CRD surfaces.
- **`allowPrivateIPs` requires `jwksUrl`.** Enforced at config time by
  `validateTrustedIssuers` (`pkg/authserver/config.go`) for every RunConfig.
  Without a hand-configured `jwksUrl`, OIDC discovery — a document fetched
  from, and thus influenceable by, the external issuer itself — would choose
  the private JWKS dial target, which is exactly what pinning it to
  operator-supplied config prevents.
- **Misconfiguration surfaces as a pod crash**, not an operator condition —
  check pod logs, not `kubectl describe`.
