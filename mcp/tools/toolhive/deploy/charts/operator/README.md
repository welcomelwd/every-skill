# ToolHive Operator Helm Chart

![Version: 0.44.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.44.0-informational?style=flat-square)
![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart for deploying the ToolHive Operator into Kubernetes.

---

## TL;DR

```console
helm upgrade -i toolhive-operator oci://ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/toolhive-operator -n toolhive-system --create-namespace
```

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.25+
- Helm 3.10+ minimum, 3.14+ recommended

## Usage

### Installing from the Chart

Install one of the available versions:

```shell
helm upgrade -i <release_name> oci://ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/toolhive-operator --version=<version> -n toolhive-system --create-namespace
```

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `toolhive-operator` deployment:

```console
helm uninstall <release_name>
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release. You will have to delete the namespace manually if you used Helm to create it.

| operator.affinity | object | `{}` | Affinity settings for the operator pod |
| operator.autoscaling | object | `{"enabled":false,"maxReplicas":100,"minReplicas":1,"targetCPUUtilizationPercentage":80}` | Configuration for horizontal pod autoscaling |
| operator.autoscaling.enabled | bool | `false` | Enable autoscaling for the operator |
| operator.autoscaling.maxReplicas | int | `100` | Maximum number of replicas |
| operator.autoscaling.minReplicas | int | `1` | Minimum number of replicas |
| operator.autoscaling.targetCPUUtilizationPercentage | int | `80` | Target CPU utilization percentage for autoscaling |
| operator.containerSecurityContext | object | `{"allowPrivilegeEscalation":false,"capabilities":{"drop":["ALL"]},"readOnlyRootFilesystem":true,"runAsNonRoot":true,"runAsUser":1000,"seccompProfile":{"type":"RuntimeDefault"}}` | Container security context settings for the operator |
| operator.defaultImagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | List of image pull secrets that the operator applies as defaults to every workload it spawns (proxy runners, vMCP servers, registry API, etc.). Per-CR `imagePullSecrets` take precedence on name collisions; chart-level entries are appended additively. The operator parses these once at startup from the TOOLHIVE_DEFAULT_IMAGE_PULL_SECRETS environment variable. The Secrets must exist in the namespace where each workload is created.  Each entry may be either a plain string (the Secret name) or an object with a `name` field, e.g.:   defaultImagePullSecrets:     - regcred     - name: otherscred The two shapes are equivalent; the object form matches `operator.imagePullSecrets` above for convenience. |
| operator.defaultRedis | object | `{"addr":"","existingSecret":"","existingSecretKey":""}` | Default Redis/Valkey address used by the operator when a workload CR has no sessionStorage configured. The operator injects this as TOOLHIVE_DEFAULT_REDIS_ADDR on pods it creates. When empty, no global Redis default is active. Override per-CR with spec.sessionStorage.  global.redis.host (from a parent umbrella chart) is used as fallback when addr is empty here. Both express the same addr concept; addr takes precedence.  For the password, reference a pre-existing Kubernetes Secret:   defaultRedis:     addr: "myredis.svc:6379"     existingSecret: "redis-credentials"     existingSecretKey: "password" |
| operator.defaultRedis.addr | string | `""` | addr is the Redis/Valkey address (host:port). |
| operator.defaultRedis.existingSecret | string | `""` | existingSecret is the name of a Secret containing the Redis password. |
| operator.defaultRedis.existingSecretKey | string | `""` | existingSecretKey is the key within existingSecret that holds the password. Empty means use global.redis.existingSecretKey or fall back to "redis-password". |
| operator.env | list | `[]` | Environment variables to set in the operator container. Supported toolhive-specific variables include: - TOOLHIVE_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK: set to "true" to disable the operator's   periodic update check against the ToolHive update API. Also disables   the usage-metrics collection that is gated on the same check. |
| operator.features.experimental | bool | `false` | Enable experimental features |
| operator.features.storageVersionMigrator | bool | `true` | Enable the StorageVersionMigrator controller, which auto-cleans status.storedVersions on opted-in toolhive.stacklok.dev CRDs so a future release can drop deprecated versions (e.g. v1alpha1) without orphaning etcd objects in the cluster. Enabled by default; set to false to opt out and handle storage-version cleanup yourself. Sets TOOLHIVE_ENABLE_STORAGE_VERSION_MIGRATOR in the operator deployment. Requires `operator.rbac.scope=cluster` — the controller watches cluster-scoped CRDs and re-stores resources across all namespaces, so the chart rejects this being true when scope is namespace. |
| operator.gc | object | `{"gogc":75,"gomemlimit":"110MiB"}` | Go memory limits and garbage collection percentage for the operator container |
| operator.gc.gogc | int | `75` | Go garbage collection percentage for the operator container |
| operator.gc.gomemlimit | string | `"110MiB"` | Go memory limits for the operator container |
| operator.image | string | `"ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/operator:v0.44.0"` | Container image for the operator |
| operator.imageDiscovery | object | `{"enabled":false,"resources":{}}` | Air-gap image-discovery aid. toolhiveRunnerImage, vmcpImage, and registryAPI.image are never rendered as chart `image:` keys — the operator only injects them into child workloads at runtime via env vars (TOOLHIVE_RUNNER_IMAGE / VMCP_IMAGE / TOOLHIVE_REGISTRY_API_IMAGE). Static manifest scanners used by air-gap tooling (e.g. a vendor portal's image list generator) discover images by reading `image:` keys out of `helm template` output, so they miss these three and an air-gapped customer can hit ImagePullBackOff on the first MCPServer / VirtualMCPServer / MCPRegistry create.  Enabling this renders a `replicas: 0` Deployment (`<release-name>-image-discovery`) whose pod template references all three images. A zero-replica Deployment never has Kubernetes schedule a pod from it, so the images are never pulled or run — this exists purely to put the refs in front of a static manifest scan. |
| operator.imageDiscovery.enabled | bool | `false` | Render the zero-replica image-discovery Deployment described above. |
| operator.imageDiscovery.resources | object | `{}` | Resource requests/limits for the image-discovery Deployment's containers. Admission control (a LimitRange, an OPA/Kyverno policy requiring explicit requests) validates these at CREATE time even though replicas: 0 means nothing ever actually runs, so this is exposed separately from operator.resources for clusters that need it set. |
| operator.imagePullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | Image pull policy for the operator container |
| operator.imagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | List of image pull secrets to use |
| operator.leaderElectionRole | object | `{"binding":{"name":"toolhive-operator-leader-election-rolebinding"},"name":"toolhive-operator-leader-election-role","rules":[{"apiGroups":[""],"resources":["configmaps"],"verbs":["get","list","watch","create","update","patch","delete"]},{"apiGroups":["coordination.k8s.io"],"resources":["leases"],"verbs":["get","list","watch","create","update","patch","delete"]},{"apiGroups":["events.k8s.io"],"resources":["events"],"verbs":["create","patch"]}]}` | Leader election role configuration |
| operator.leaderElectionRole.binding.name | string | `"toolhive-operator-leader-election-rolebinding"` | Name of the role binding for leader election |
| operator.leaderElectionRole.name | string | `"toolhive-operator-leader-election-role"` | Name of the role for leader election |
| operator.leaderElectionRole.rules | list | `[{"apiGroups":[""],"resources":["configmaps"],"verbs":["get","list","watch","create","update","patch","delete"]},{"apiGroups":["coordination.k8s.io"],"resources":["leases"],"verbs":["get","list","watch","create","update","patch","delete"]},{"apiGroups":["events.k8s.io"],"resources":["events"],"verbs":["create","patch"]}]` | Rules for the leader election role |
| operator.livenessProbe | object | `{"httpGet":{"path":"/healthz","port":"health"},"initialDelaySeconds":15,"periodSeconds":20}` | Liveness probe configuration for the operator |
| operator.nodeSelector | object | `{}` | Node selector for the operator pod |
| operator.podAnnotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to add to the operator pod |
| operator.podLabels | object | `{}` | Labels to add to the operator pod |
| operator.podSecurityContext | object | `{"runAsNonRoot":true}` | Pod security context settings |
| operator.ports | list | `[{"containerPort":8080,"name":"metrics","protocol":"TCP"},{"containerPort":8081,"name":"health","protocol":"TCP"}]` | List of ports to expose from the operator container |
| operator.proxyHost | string | `"0.0.0.0"` | Host for the proxy deployed by the operator |
| operator.rbac | object | `{"allowedNamespaces":[],"scope":"cluster"}` | RBAC configuration for the operator |
| operator.rbac.allowedNamespaces | list | `[]` | List of namespaces that the operator is allowed to have permissions to manage. Only used if scope is set to "namespace". |
| operator.rbac.scope | string | `"cluster"` | Scope of the RBAC configuration. - cluster: The operator will have cluster-wide permissions via ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding. - namespace: The operator will have permissions to manage resources in the namespaces specified in `allowedNamespaces`.   The operator will have a ClusterRole and RoleBinding for each namespace in `allowedNamespaces`. |
| operator.readinessProbe | object | `{"httpGet":{"path":"/readyz","port":"health"},"initialDelaySeconds":5,"periodSeconds":10}` | Readiness probe configuration for the operator |
| operator.replicaCount | int | `1` | Number of replicas for the operator deployment |
| operator.resources | object | `{"limits":{"cpu":"500m","memory":"128Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"10m","memory":"64Mi"}}` | Resource requests and limits for the operator container |
| operator.serviceAccount | object | `{"annotations":{},"automountServiceAccountToken":true,"create":true,"labels":{},"name":"toolhive-operator"}` | Service account configuration for the operator |
| operator.serviceAccount.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations to add to the service account |
| operator.serviceAccount.automountServiceAccountToken | bool | `true` | Automatically mount a ServiceAccount's API credentials |
| operator.serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Specifies whether a service account should be created |
| operator.serviceAccount.labels | object | `{}` | Labels to add to the service account |
| operator.serviceAccount.name | string | `"toolhive-operator"` | The name of the service account to use. If not set and create is true, a name is generated. |
| operator.tolerations | list | `[]` | Tolerations for the operator pod |
| operator.toolhiveRunnerImage | string | `"ghcr.io/stacklok/toolhive/proxyrunner:v0.44.0"` | Image to use for Toolhive runners |
