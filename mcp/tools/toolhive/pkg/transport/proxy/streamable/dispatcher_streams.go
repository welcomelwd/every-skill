// serverStreamRegistry is a transport-agnostic registry of live server->client
// streams, used to deliver unsolicited container notifications to the
// standalone stream for each MCP session. Per the MCP spec, a server MUST NOT
// deliver the same notification more than once per session: this registry
// enforces that by keying on session ID and allowing at most one stream per
// session. It has no knowledge of HTTP: callers (the GET handler in
// streamable_proxy.go) own translating a registered stream's messages into
// wire frames.
//
// Forward-compatibility note: the 2026-07-28 (Modern) revision's
// "subscriptions/listen" method (see mcp.MCPVersionModern in
// pkg/mcp/revision.go) is a reasonable candidate to fan out through this SAME
// decoupled registry rather than inventing a second mechanism, but it is NOT
// a drop-in reuse. Per the draft spec, a future Modern handler will need real
// adaptation on top of what is here today: "subscriptions/listen" is a
// long-lived POST (not a GET), Modern has no sessions so streams must be
// re-keyed per-subscription-id rather than per session ID, delivery requires
// per-notification-type AND per-URI opt-in filtering (not blanket fan-out),
// an initial notifications/subscriptions/acknowledged must be sent, and
// deliveries must be tagged with io.modelcontextprotocol/subscriptionId. Keep
// this type free of HTTP/GET-specific assumptions so that adaptation, when it
// happens, does not also require a rewrite of the fan-out primitives
// themselves.
//
// All fields are guarded by mu; do not add another synchronization primitive
// over streams (see the "one synchronization primitive per data structure"
// style rule). The only channel operation performed while mu is held is a
// non-blocking select-send in broadcast, dispatchTo, and deliverToMany, which
