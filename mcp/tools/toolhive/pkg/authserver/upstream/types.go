	// Subject is the canonical user identifier carried into session storage
	// and issued JWTs. Source by provider type:
	//   - OIDC: "sub" from the validated ID token.
	//   - OAuth2 with userInfo: "sub" (or field-mapped) from userinfo.
	//   - OAuth2 without userInfo: synthesized "tk-…" value derived from the
	//     access token (Synthetic=true; see synthesizeSubjectFromAccessToken).
	//
	// Stability: stable across refresh-token rotation that preserves the
	// access token; in synthesis mode it rotates per fresh authorization
	// code flow, so callers must treat synthesized Subjects as ephemeral
	// session keys, not stable per-user identifiers.
	Subject string

	// Name is the user's display name from the upstream IDP (optional).
	Name string

	// Email is the user's email address from the upstream IDP (optional).

	// Synthetic is true when Subject was generated locally because the
	// upstream has no userinfo or ID-token-derived identity. Synthetic
	// subjects rotate per re-auth; callers MUST NOT persist them as stable
	// per-user keys (doing so grows `users` without bound). Use the
	// synthesized Subject as an ephemeral session key only.
	Synthetic bool

	// Claims holds the raw claims resolved from the upstream IDP for this
	// identity, for downstream authorization-policy inputs. Source by provider

	//   - OIDC: all claims from the validated ID token.
	//   - OAuth2 with userInfo: all claims from the userinfo response.
	//   - OAuth2 with identityFromToken, or synthetic OAuth2: nil — those paths
	//     resolve only scalar subject/name/email (or nothing), with no structured
	//     claim set to carry.

	// resolution or token storage. May be nil.
