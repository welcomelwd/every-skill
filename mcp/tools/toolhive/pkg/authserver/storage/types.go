// UserStorage provides user and provider identity management operations.
// This interface supports multi-IDP scenarios where a single user can authenticate
// via multiple upstream identity providers (e.g., Google and GitHub).
//
// The User type represents the internal ToolHive identity. Its ID becomes the "sub"
// claim in issued JWTs, providing a stable identity across multiple providers.
//
// ProviderIdentity links a user to a specific upstream provider. The
// (ProviderID, ProviderSubject) pair uniquely identifies an upstream identity.
//
// # Account Linking Security
//
// When implementing account linking (one User with multiple ProviderIdentities),
// callers MUST verify user consent before linking. See OAuth 2.0 Security BCP.
//
// TODO(auth): When implementing double-hop auth (Company IDP -> External IDP),
// add the following to this interface:
//   - DeleteProviderIdentity(providerID, subject) - unlink specific provider
//   - Add Primary field to ProviderIdentity to distinguish Company IDP from linked External IDPs
//   - Add ConsentRecord tracking for external provider linking

// Storage combines fosite storage interfaces with ToolHive-specific storage for
// upstream IDP tokens, pending authorization requests, and client registration.
// The auth server requires a Storage implementation; use NewMemoryStorage() for
// single-instance deployments or NewRedisStorage() for distributed deployments.
//
// # Fosite Interface Segregation
//
// Fosite splits storage into separate interfaces (AuthorizeCodeStorage, AccessTokenStorage,
// RefreshTokenStorage, PKCERequestStorage) following the Interface Segregation Principle.
// This enables:
//   - Feature composition: Only enable OAuth features you need
//   - Testing isolation: Mock specific interfaces for focused tests
//   - Clear contracts: Each interface documents its requirements
//
// # Key Design Patterns
//
// All token storage methods store fosite.Requester (not just token values) because token
// validation requires the full authorization context (client, scopes, session).
//
// Methods use two key types:
//   - Signature: Cryptographic token identifier for token-specific operations
//   - Request ID: Grant identifier for finding all tokens from one authorization
//
// See doc.go for comprehensive documentation of fosite's storage design.
type Storage interface {
	// Embed segregated interfaces for IDP tokens, pending authorizations, client registry,
	// and user management for multi-IDP support.
	//
	// DCRCredentialStore is intentionally NOT embedded here: doing so would
	// promote GetDCRCredentials / StoreDCRCredentials onto every consumer of
	// storage.Storage (handlers, server, registration, etc.), broadening the
	// surface that can read raw client_secret / registration_access_token even
	// when those consumers have no DCR responsibility. Code that legitimately
	// needs DCR access (the runner and authserver constructors) obtains it
	// via an explicit `stor.(DCRCredentialStore)` type assertion at the
	// boundary; the per-backend `var _ DCRCredentialStore = (*MemoryStorage)(nil)`
	// and `var _ DCRCredentialStore = (*RedisStorage)(nil)` checks in
	// memory.go / redis.go provide the compile-time guarantee that production
	// backends satisfy the interface, so the runtime assertion is provably
	// safe at the boundary while keeping the wider Storage surface narrow.

	// AuthorizeCodeStorage provides authorization code storage for the Authorization Code
	// Grant (RFC 6749 Section 4.1). Authorization codes are one-time-use and short-lived.
	// CreateAuthorizeCodeSession stores by code, GetAuthorizeCodeSession retrieves by code,
	// InvalidateAuthorizeCodeSession marks as used (subsequent Gets return ErrInvalidatedAuthorizeCode).
	oauth2.AuthorizeCodeStorage

	// AccessTokenStorage provides access token session storage. Methods use "signature"
	// (derived from token value) as the key for O(1) lookup when validating tokens.
	// The stored fosite.Requester contains the full authorization context including
	// the Session with expiration times via session.GetExpiresAt(fosite.AccessToken).
	oauth2.AccessTokenStorage

	// RefreshTokenStorage provides refresh token session storage. CreateRefreshTokenSession
	// accepts an accessSignature to link refresh tokens to their access tokens for rotation.
	// RotateRefreshToken uses requestID to invalidate both the refresh token and all
	// related access tokens from the same authorization grant.
	oauth2.RefreshTokenStorage

	// TokenRevocationStorage provides token revocation per RFC 7009. RevokeAccessToken
	// and RevokeRefreshToken take requestID (not signature) because RFC 7009 requires
	// revoking a refresh token SHOULD also invalidate associated access tokens, which
	// requires finding all tokens by their common grant identifier.
	oauth2.TokenRevocationStorage

	// PKCERequestStorage provides PKCE challenge/verifier storage (RFC 7636).
	// Stores the code_challenge during authorization, validates code_verifier during
	// token exchange. Keyed by the same code/signature as the authorization code.
	pkce.PKCERequestStorage

	// Health checks connectivity to the storage backend.
	// Returns nil if the storage is healthy and reachable.
	Health(ctx context.Context) error

	// Close releases any resources held by the storage implementation.
	// This should be called when the storage is no longer needed.
	Close() error
