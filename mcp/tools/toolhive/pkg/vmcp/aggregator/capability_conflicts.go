// This file resolves cross-backend identity conflicts for the list
// capabilities NOT covered by the ConflictResolver strategies: resources
// (identity: URI), resource templates (identity: URITemplate) and prompts
// (identity: Name). Tools are resolved separately through
// ConflictResolver.ResolveToolConflicts.
//
// ResolveConflicts is the ENFORCEMENT POINT for these policies: after it
// runs, every identity is unique within its list. The first-wins guards in
// the merge helpers (mergeResources/mergeResourceTemplates/mergePrompts in
// default_aggregator.go) re-check the same invariant, but only as defence in
// depth for direct MergeCapabilities callers — in the aggregation pipeline
// they can never fire. Policy changes belong here, not there.
//
// The policies deliberately differ per type:
//
//   - Resource URIs and template strings are LOCATORS, not names. The client
//     passes them back verbatim (resources/read, resources/subscribe,
//     completion refs), backends emit them in notifications and embedded
//     resource contents, and a template-matched read forwards the client's
//     concrete URI untranslated (see MergeCapabilities). Rewriting them would
//     break those round trips, so a duplicated URI is instead advertised
//     ONCE: the backend earliest in sorted-backend-ID order wins and later
//     duplicates are dropped with a warning naming the URI and both backends.
//     Reads strictly improve — the routing table keys by URI, so at most one
//     backend was ever served per URI, previously a nondeterministically-
//     chosen one, now a stable one. Listing does regress from N
//     indistinguishable entries to one, but the protocol gives a client no
//     way to address the other N-1, so the extra entries promised reads that
//     could never be honoured.
//
//   - Prompt names are NAMES, like tool names: prompts/get is translated back
//     to the backend's own name via BackendTarget.GetBackendCapabilityName,
//     so renaming is lossless. By DEFAULT every prompt is renamed to its
//     backend-prefixed form — the configured prefixFormat applied to the
//     backend ID (default "{workload}_") — mirroring what
//     PrefixConflictResolver does for every tool. Under the PRIORITY strategy
//     (the same escape hatch tools have for clients that pin names), backends
//     listed in priorityOrder keep their bare prompt names, a bare-name
//     collision among listed backends resolves to the highest-priority one,
//     and unlisted backends stay ALWAYS prefixed — deliberately stricter
//     than the tool priority resolver, which lets a conflict-free unlisted
//     tool keep its bare name.
//
//     Under priority the losing prompt is DROPPED, never re-prefixed. That is
//     deliberate and must stay that way: re-prefixing the loser to "save" it
//     would re-advertise the same prompt under a name no policy mentions, so
//     a forbid written against the bare name would stop matching it — a
//     fail-open. Do not "improve" this by prefixing the loser instead of
//     dropping it.
//
//     The invariant both modes preserve, scoped precisely: the advertised
//     name of a given (backendID, prompt name) PAIR is a pure function of the
//     aggregation config and that pair — it NEVER shifts because an unrelated
//     backend joined or left the group. That stability is a security property,
//     not cosmetics: the advertised name is what authorization matches on
//     (Cedar builds Prompt::"<advertised name>" entities — see
//     pkg/vmcp/core/admission.go), so a membership-dependent rename would
//     silently detach permit AND forbid policies from the prompt they were
//     written for, the forbid case failing open. Names move only on an
//     explicit config edit — the moment an operator reviews policy anyway.
//
//     What the invariant does NOT promise is that a given advertised STRING
//     keeps naming the same prompt. Under priority two listed backends can
//     claim the same bare name, and the higher-ranked one takes it: a
//     permit(... resource == Prompt::"review") written while b1 owned "review"
//     silently begins authorizing b2's DIFFERENT prompt once a higher-ranked
//     b2 advertising that name deploys, with no config edit. Cedar's resource
//     identity is Prompt::<advertised name> and nothing else — it carries no
//     backend attribute — so whoever wins a shared name inherits every policy
//     written for it. forbid still fails closed, because the loser is dropped
//     rather than aliased; it is permit that gets redirected. Operators who
//     write name-scoped permits must therefore review priorityOrder and their
//     policy set together.
//
//     A name no single backend can own is advertised by NOBODY. When two
//     distinct (backendID, name) pairs compose to the same advertised string
//     (backend "b1" prompt "x_y" and backend "b1_x" prompt "y" both compose to
//     "b1_x_y"), EVERY colliding prompt is dropped and the collision is logged
//     at ERROR. Failing the aggregation instead would take out tools/list,
//     resources/list, resource-templates/list, prompts/list, Discover's
//     presence flags and backend visibility for the whole group over one
//     ambiguous prompt name — and that name needs no conflict-resolution
//     config to reach, just an unlucky combination of operator-chosen workload
//     names and backend-chosen prompt names. Dropping every claimant is the
//     safe outcome rather than the convenient one: keeping a survivor would
//     hand it the ambiguous name and with it any policy written for the other
//     prompt, whereas an unadvertised name makes every permit and forbid on it
//     vacuous, so nothing is reachable under an ambiguous identity and the
//     rest of the group keeps serving.
//
//     Prompt-set changes on a live backend propagate to connected sessions
//     through the list_changed resync path
//     (pkg/vmcp/server/serve_list_changed.go), but that path is add-only for
//     prompts, so a removed prompt stays advertised on already-registered
//     sessions until they reconnect (stacklok/toolhive-core#184). A backend
//     joining or leaving the group emits no push signal today, so staleness
//     there is bounded by the aggregator cache TTL for routing and by the
//     client's next prompts/list for listing.
//
// All functions iterate backends in the caller-supplied deterministic order
// and return key-sorted slices, so the aggregated view (and therefore the
// routing table built from it) is stable run to run.

// resolveResourceConflicts de-duplicates resources by URI across backends.
// backendIDs supplies the deterministic (sorted) iteration order.

// resolvePromptConflicts forms every prompt's advertised name per the naming
// config: backends listed in naming.priorityRank keep their bare name, all

// prefixed. Either way the advertised name never depends on what else is
// deployed; see the file header for why that matters to authorization.
//
// An exact duplicate within one backend (same backend advertises a name
// twice) is dropped with a warning — both entries would advertise and route
// identically, so nothing reachable is lost. A bare-name collision among

// rank), dropping the others with a warning, mirroring the tool priority
// strategy. Any other collision — two advertised names composing to the same
// string (backend "b1" prompt "x_y" vs backend "b1_x" prompt "y"), or a
// prefixed name hitting a listed backend's literal bare name — has no defined
// owner, so EVERY prompt claiming that name is dropped and the collision is
// logged at ERROR. This never fails: the group keeps serving the prompts it
// can name unambiguously, and the ambiguous name is advertised by nobody. See
