// Package core defines the Virtual MCP domain object: the identity-parameterized
// [VMCP] interface and the [Config] of collaborators that New assembles into a
// working core.
//
// The core is the domain boundary extracted from today's transport god-object
// (server.New): it aggregates backend capabilities, routes calls, and drives
// composite workflows behind a single, identity-explicit contract. It lives in
// its own package — rather than the root pkg/vmcp package — because Config
// references the aggregator, router, composer, health, and authz collaborators,
// all of which import pkg/vmcp; placing the core here lets it depend on both the
// root domain types and those collaborators without an import cycle.
//
// No mcp-go types cross this boundary (vmcp anti-pattern #5): the interface speaks
// only in root pkg/vmcp domain types ([vmcp.Tool], [vmcp.Resource], [vmcp.Prompt],
// and their result wrappers) plus an explicit [*auth.Identity].

// VMCP is the core Virtual MCP domain object.
//
// Contract:
//   - Identity is an explicit parameter on every method and is NEVER read from
//     context (anti-pattern #1). A nil identity is anonymous; bound-identity
//     mismatch is the caller's concern only at the session layer (in Serve), not
//     here — the core takes an already-authenticated *auth.Identity. The
//     nil-identity/anonymous semantics mirror session/types.ShouldAllowAnonymous;
//     the concrete behavior is reproduced by New.
//   - Implementations MUST be safe for concurrent use.
//   - Decorators may only SUBTRACT reachability: filter list output or refuse a
//     call before delegating to inner. They hold only an inner VMCP and have no
//     path to backends except through it, so they cannot widen access. This
//     mirrors the list-filter/call-deny pairing in pkg/authz/tool_filter.go, and
//     applies to backends too: a decorator may drop entries from ListBackends
//     output or refuse a LookupBackend, but never surface a backend inner withheld.
//   - args/meta maps are treated as read-only; the core copies before mutating
//     (go-style: copy before mutating caller input).
//   - ReadResource results: Meta may be nil — the mcp-go resources/read handler
//     cannot forward _meta (see the NOTE on [vmcp.ResourceReadResult].Meta).
//     Do not rely on it.
//
// ctx is used only for cancellation, deadlines, and trace propagation — never to
// carry identity or other domain data.
