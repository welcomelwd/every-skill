## 20.1.1

### Patch Changes

- e17cd7b: Keep hosted mixed-auth tool calls on the browser MCP connection, pause them in Inspector chat with an amber Authenticate action, resume the same client-side chat turn after popup authorization, and automatically replay an interrupted turn after a full-page OAuth redirect.
- e17cd7b: Enable the Inspector Skills tab when a dev-server HMR reload adds skills after
  the initial connection negotiated without the Skills extension.
- e17cd7b: Detect mixed-auth MCP servers without blocking anonymous connections, expose optional authentication in React, the CLI, and the Inspector, resume protected operations through the official SDK OAuth flow, and preserve multiple Set-Cookie headers through the Node bridge for colocated OAuth servers.
- e17cd7b: Disable reverse-proxy buffering for open-ended MCP SSE responses so v2 subscription acknowledgements reach clients immediately, and move optional mixed-auth discovery off the connection readiness path while preserving asynchronous React updates and CLI reporting.
- e17cd7b: Recover mixed-auth metadata discovery after transient failures, preserve ready React connections when optional token projection fails, report authenticated state after challenged OAuth, correct CLI login recovery, suppress failure results for user-cancelled Inspector tools, and keep the mixed-OAuth example's authorization guard aligned with MCP JSON parsing.

## 20.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 33e30cb: Block loopback proxy targets by default. `mountInspector` now defaults `oauthProxyAllowLoopback` to `false` (previously `true`), so a publicly reachable embedded/hosted Inspector no longer proxies requests to the host's loopback services (SSRF). The standalone CLI keeps allowing loopback for local development, but defaults to blocking it when `NODE_ENV=production` (which the published Docker image sets); set `INSPECTOR_ALLOW_LOOPBACK=true` to override either way.
- 33e30cb: Update runtime and bundled dependencies to patched stable releases and tighten transitive dependency resolutions. The Better Auth example remains on its stable 1.6.x provider with its single-audience mitigation.

### Major Changes

- a9ba017: Migrate the client stack to the official MCP TypeScript SDK v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.2`).
  - `@mcp-use/client` now depends on `@modelcontextprotocol/client` instead of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Both `@mcp-use/client` and `@mcp-use/agent` are ESM-only (Node 22.22.2+); CommonJS `require()` entry points and builds are no longer published. All connectors, sessions, OAuth, and the React `useMcp` hook were ported to the v2 API surface (method-string handlers, `SdkHttpError`/`SdkError`, `OAuthError`, `Headers`, `client/stdio` subpath).
  - Automatic protocol negotiation: HTTP connections default to `versionNegotiation: "auto"` (probe with `server/discover`, transparently falling back to the 2025 `initialize` handshake against v1 servers); stdio defaults to the SDK's v1 mode. The negotiated generation/version is exposed on the connection and `useMcp` result as `protocolEra: "legacy" | "modern"` and `protocolVersion`.
  - OAuth: consolidated `OAuthError`, issuer-stamp round-tripping, `discoveryState()` / `saveDiscoveryState()`, and `iss` validation on the callback (SEP-2352 / RFC 9207).
  - The root `@mcp-use/client` export now selects a browser-safe HTTP implementation outside Node and a Node-enabled implementation under Node. `@mcp-use/client/browser`, `@mcp-use/client/auth`, and `@mcp-use/client/auth/node` were removed; use the root `MCPClient`, `createOAuthProvider`, and React entry instead.
  - Breaking: the Node root entry no longer re-exports `BrowserOAuthClientProvider`, `BrowserOAuthOptions`, or `onMcpAuthorization` (those pull browser/`localStorage` code into the Node graph). Import them from `@mcp-use/client` in a browser bundler (default export condition) or from `@mcp-use/client/react` for the callback helper.
  - `MCPClient.connect()` / `createSession()` auto-provisions OAuth for HTTP servers (via the entry’s `createOAuthProvider`) when no bearer/`authProvider` is set, completes the 401 → consent dance, and retries. Pass `oauth` options or `oauth: false` on the server config; `authProvider` remains an escape hatch. The CLI connect path uses this instead of hand-wiring `NodeOAuthClientProvider`.
  - Breaking: removed v1 aliases (`samplingCallback`, `elicitationCallback`, `auth_token`, `customHeaders`, `clientConfig`, `debug`, `BrowserTelemetry`, and `ResourceTemplate`). Use `onSampling`, `onElicitation`, `authToken`, `headers`, `clientInfo`, `logLevel`, `Telemetry`, and `ResourceTemplateType`.
  - Dependency slimming: removed `posthog-js` / `posthog-node` in favor of a `fetch`-only PostHog capture (no SDK), and dropped `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` (a single MIME-type constant was inlined). `@mcp-use/client` now has a single runtime dependency (`@modelcontextprotocol/client`).
  - The v2 packages use commit-pinned MCP SDK preview builds required by this beta; `@mcp-use/agent` no longer carries the unused v1 `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
  - Runtime verification now covers Node, Deno, browser, and React against real v1 and v2 servers. Browser fetch is explicitly bound, Deno logging does not require env permission, and `useMcp` reaches `ready` only after normalized metadata is populated.
  - Client examples now run against a four-server matrix (official SDK stateful v1/stateless v2 plus mcp-use v1/v2 servers with MCP Apps) and cover notifications, roots, sampling, elicitation, completion, capability negotiation, OAuth, and rendered widgets. HTTP/stdio config now forwards initial roots, SDK client options, default request options, and HTTP connection timeouts to connectors.
  - Fixed legacy Streamable HTTP reverse RPC and notifications: streaming responses are no longer consumed by request logging, and sampling/elicitation use the active request transport. The v2 client auto-opens list-change subscriptions and preserves progress across MRTR retry rounds.
  - `McpClientProvider` now propagates negotiated v1/v2 metadata, auth state, resource templates, and reverse-request queues consistently. Its configured display label is now `displayName`; `name` remains the negotiated server identity.
  - React connections are HTTP-only, reconnect automatically, suppress console logging, and wait for explicit OAuth authentication by default. `clientOptions.capabilities.views: true` advertises MCP Apps support without hand-writing extension capabilities.
  - OAuth and transport proxies now preserve the upstream MCP URL as the SDK resource identity. Removed metadata/resource rewrite shims and gateway-derived OAuth URLs; MCP and OAuth bytes use separate injected fetch adapters.
  - Browser OAuth supports CIMD through `clientMetadataUrl`, keeps DCR as SDK-managed compatibility fallback, stores credentials per authorization-server issuer, and rejects browser client secrets.
  - The Inspector OAuth BFF now binds requests to SDK-discovered metadata/endpoints, fails closed on SSRF/private targets and redirects, caps bodies/timeouts, strips unsafe headers, and restricts CORS origins.
  - Breaking: `@mcp-use/client` and `@mcp-use/agent` are ESM-only. Use ESM `import` or dynamic `import()` from a CommonJS host; direct `require()` is unsupported. The client no longer re-exports Zod `*Schema` constants (use `isSpecType` / `specTypeSchemas`). The exported `telFetch` is now a plain non-throwing `fetch` wrapper `(url, init) => Promise<void>` (previously a PostHog `fetch` override). Removed the vendored `JSONSchemaToZod` helper — use Zod 4's native `z.fromJSONSchema()` instead.
  - The inspector and CLI were updated to consume the v2 client; the CLI gains a `--negotiate` flag on `client connect`. The CLI binary is now ESM (`dist/index.js`) since `@mcp-use/client` is ESM-only (`npx mcp-use` is unaffected).
  - Internal `@mcp-use/client` src layout reorganized into semantic folders (`transport/`, flat root client API, `code-mode/`, slim `auth/`, collapsed `react/`); public package exports (`.` and `./react`) and symbol names are unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- b4c192e: Enable localhost managed inspector chat via browser MCPAgent and the cloud LLM proxy. Anonymous users must sign in; authenticated usage draws from Autumn `llm_tokens` credits.

### Patch Changes

- 6827ab2: Resolve the current Inspector beta once per page load, then load the entry script, stylesheet, and lazy chunks from the same immutable release. This prevents mixed-version CDN 404s while keeping embedded inspectors on the latest beta.
- c878835: Fix duplicated public assets in production builds and remove Scarf telemetry.

  **mcp-use**
  - Set `publicDir: false` on all Vite build steps so project `public/` is copied only to `.mcp-use/build/views/public/` (not duplicated at the build root or inside each view outDir).
  - Raise the view client build `chunkSizeWarningLimit` to reduce noisy warnings for large view bundles.

  **@mcp-use/client**
  - Remove Scarf download telemetry (`captureScarf`, beacon helpers, and related storage); PostHog remains the sole telemetry provider.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Drop inspector package-download Scarf tracking on init; update README and e2e docs to reflect PostHog-only telemetry.

- 3aca19c: Prefer Bun over Yarn in the scaffold CLI and docs, and make production source maps opt-in.

  **mcp-use**
  - Add `--source-maps` so `mcp-use build` emits source maps only when requested (server and view bundles default to no maps).
  - Widen `NextConfigLike` with an index signature so `withMcpUse` accepts arbitrary Next.js config fields.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Replace `--yarn` with `--bun`, detect Bun from the user agent, and install/run with Bun when selected.

  **@mcp-use/agent / @mcp-use/client**
  - Point missing-optional-dependency errors at npm, pnpm, or Bun instead of Yarn.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Drop Yarn-specific install/lint scripts from the package scripts surface.

- 24d2024: Make MCP Apps Chat messages await delivery, scope widget model context to the active Chat surface, and keep app-only tools out of model tool registries.
- ac3d1eb: Harden browser launching, Inspector routes, and browser persistence. OAuth
  session values are encrypted at rest, secret connection fields are no longer
  persisted, Inspector assets and proxy/OAuth APIs are rate-limited, and CLI
  browser opening now validates HTTP(S) targets and uses shell-free launchers.
- fa40e85: Default hosted chat and Manufact sign-in to the Manufact Cloud endpoint when no runtime or build-time chat URL is configured. Remove the dark-mode border from the sign-in card and render the Manufact wordmark in white.
- b7ce16f: Bundle Inspector tabs and routes into a single JavaScript entry point so tab navigation does not wait for lazy CDN chunks.
- f06deff: Harden the v2 beta release train and package boundaries before GA.
  - Reject prerelease plans that would reuse or lag an npm beta version, and keep Inspector versioned with the exact `mcp-use` beta it supports.
  - Use the modern Langfuse LangChain adapter so the Agent's optional LangChain and observability peers resolve together.
  - Keep Inspector framework peers optional for standalone installs and refresh public v2 server and MCP Apps documentation.

- c4ac07a: Keep the Inspector chat composer available over fullscreen MCP Apps, with a compact input and collapsible transcript drawer.
- eedeb4f: Restore complete Inspector relay support for MCP transport and OAuth discovery, registration, and token exchange. Keep confidential dynamic-client secrets in the server-side BFF, recover stale per-server browser OAuth and connection storage safely, isolate callback exchange from background reconnects, and tolerate unsupported optional inventory methods.

  Improve Inspector diagnostics and connection-list behavior with inline error details, a localhost recovery command for hosted callback rejections, newest-first servers, bottom scroll spacing, reliable favicon loading, and versioned revalidated standalone assets.

  Make the Inspector project-pinned local development tooling. Generated projects install `@mcp-use/inspector` as a dev dependency, and `mcp-use dev` dynamically calls its framework-neutral `mountInspector()` on the existing listener. The installed package now owns the only MCP/OAuth proxy and serves its `dist/app` browser bundle locally with no remote application fallback; production handlers no longer expose an Inspector shell or duplicate proxy implementation.

- e497782: Fix managed chat OAuth forwarding and polish chat UI.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Fix server-side chat for OAuth MCP servers (e.g. Linear): forward live connection tokens when saved auth config is `none`, so hosted chat no longer 401s while Tools stay connected.
  - Add a top scroll fade on the chat message list so content softens under the floating header when scrolling.
  - Center the Manufact cloud / API key tabs in Configure Chat and tighten spacing below them.

- a3d8591: Make Inspector connection modes authoritative for MCP proxy routing. Auto mode now attempts a direct browser connection before falling back to the configured CORS proxy, Direct mode never uses or falls back to the proxy, and Proxy mode uses it immediately. Clear stale proxy settings when an existing Inspector connection changes modes, keep the server's built-in Inspector on direct origin-level OAuth metadata discovery when no proxy backend is mounted, bypass the browser HTTP cache for OAuth metadata so Origin-specific CORS responses cannot be reused across Inspector origins, make the server-tile Authenticate action clear stored OAuth discovery before starting a fresh flow, and discard authorization-server-generated client secrets from public browser DCR results instead of persisting them.
- af09aee: Enable server-to-client sampling for legacy stateful MCP connections. Hide the
  sampling content, disable its navigation tab with an explanatory tooltip, and
  omit the sampling client capability on modern stateless connections.
- c7accd6: Fix standalone Inspector OAuth and CDN delivery.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Serve the built UI from `dist/cdn/` locally in standalone mode (`pnpm start` / `npx`); embedded mounts still default to jsDelivr `@beta`.
  - Point `pnpm start` at `dist/cli.js` so standalone runs the full proxy + OAuth BFF shell.
  - Skip `dev/info` tunnel probes in standalone mode (route exists only under `mcp-use dev`).
  - Simplify e2e matrix: builtin/prod modes rely on in-process static assets instead of a separate CDN fixture server.
  - Document jsDelivr-first embedding vs local standalone in `docs/inspector/integration.mdx`.

  **@mcp-use/client**
  - Fix Linear (and other OAuth) redirect flows: do not auto-connect saved MCP servers on `/oauth/callback`, which overwrote the PKCE verifier before token exchange.
  - Stop HEAD health-check polling after a 405/404 from servers that only accept POST (reduces console noise for providers like Linear).

- b47e268: Raise the Node.js engine floor from `>=20.19.0` to `>=22.13.0` across published packages, scaffolds, examples, CI, Docker, and esbuild/tsup build targets. Use `@types/node` `^22.13.0`. Required for pnpm 11.13 in GitHub Actions and unblocks the beta release workflow.
- 1579839: Raise the Node.js engine floor to `>=22.22.2` (post–March 2026 security release) and pin CI to Node 22.23.1 so trusted npm 12 publishing works.
- c1c6c2b: Publish the optimized standalone Inspector and CLI packaging: ordinary mcp-use installs avoid the Inspector UI dependency graph, while Inspector, client tooling, and production opt-ins remain available on demand.
- d9c2023: Skip `dev/info` tunnel probes unless `mcp-use dev` injects `window.__MCP_DEV_CLI__`.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Gate tunnel metadata probes on `window.__MCP_DEV_CLI__ === true` instead of treating a missing `__MCP_INSPECTOR_MODE__` as non-standalone.

  **mcp-use**
  - Set `MCP_USE_DEV_CLI` in the dev CLI and inject `window.__MCP_DEV_CLI__ = true` into the inspector CDN shell so embedded dev sessions still sync tunnel state.

- 042a082: Use the standard OAuth consent flow when signing in to hosted Inspector chat.
- da86879: Keep MCP Apps widgets mounted while Chat state changes, deliver complete tool lifecycle notifications, isolate sandbox origins, and support host-confirmed sampling, downloads, context updates, and app-provided tools.
- 3294086: Stream partial tool-call arguments into the Inspector drawer and MCP App view while the model is generating them. Anthropic tool requests now opt into eager input streaming, partial JSON healing handles code and SVG strings correctly, hosted chat accepts tool-call start/delta frames, and the view host no longer overwrites newer partial input with a stale complete-input notification.
- be2dd8e: Expose the dependency-free sandbox document builder as a focused client
  subpath and bundle it into the Inspector's Node entry so the zero-dependency
  Inspector package loads in clean installations.
- fe4d3b2: Enable MCP view JS code splitting and polish inspector boot UX.

  **mcp-use**
  - Enable rolldown code splitting for per-view client builds (`chunkFileNames` alongside the entry chunk) for external assets and split chunks.
  - Paint a centered boot spinner in the managed inspector shell while the CDN bundle downloads.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Match the boot spinner placeholder in the CDN inspector shell.
  - Add top margin to tool error banners in the result panel.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Fix scaffold README inspector links to `${basePath}/inspector` (`/mcp/inspector` by default).
  - Align the mcp-apps `mcp-env.d.ts` template comment with the auto-generated shim.

- f259641: Align view authoring layout, typing shims, and local dev host behavior across the v2 stack.

  **mcp-use**
  - Move file-based view sources from `resources/` to `views/` (wire exposure stays MCP resources).
  - Replace root `tools.d.ts` with `mcp-env.d.ts`, adding CSS module typing plus the live `Register` import shim; dev/build create it exclusively when absent.
  - Simplify favicon selection to the first icon (or explicit `favicon` config).
  - Auto-respawn the dev tunnel on disconnect with exponential backoff and subdomain fallback.

  **@mcp-use/client**
  - Add `mockOpenAiFileApis` on `ViewRenderer` and export `injectOpenAiFileApis` so `useFiles()` works in inspector and other local hosts.
  - Advertise host `message` capability by default.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Enable `mockOpenAiFileApis` in view preview and standalone host props.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Refresh starter, blank, and MCP Apps scaffolds for `views/`, `mcp-env.d.ts`, webp demo assets, and the expanded product-search carousel template.

  - mcp-use@2.0.0

## 20.0.0-beta.60

### Patch Changes

- f06deff: Harden the v2 beta release train and package boundaries before GA.
  - Reject prerelease plans that would reuse or lag an npm beta version, and keep Inspector versioned with the exact `mcp-use` beta it supports.
  - Use the modern Langfuse LangChain adapter so the Agent's optional LangChain and observability peers resolve together.
  - Keep Inspector framework peers optional for standalone installs and refresh public v2 server and MCP Apps documentation.

- Updated dependencies [c1c6c2b]
  - mcp-use@2.0.0-beta.26

## 20.0.0-beta.17

### Patch Changes

- eedeb4f: Restore complete Inspector relay support for MCP transport and OAuth discovery, registration, and token exchange. Keep confidential dynamic-client secrets in the server-side BFF, recover stale per-server browser OAuth and connection storage safely, isolate callback exchange from background reconnects, and tolerate unsupported optional inventory methods.

  Improve Inspector diagnostics and connection-list behavior with inline error details, a localhost recovery command for hosted callback rejections, newest-first servers, bottom scroll spacing, reliable favicon loading, and versioned revalidated standalone assets.

  Make the Inspector project-pinned local development tooling. Generated projects install `@mcp-use/inspector` as a dev dependency, and `mcp-use dev` dynamically calls its framework-neutral `mountInspector()` on the existing listener. The installed package now owns the only MCP/OAuth proxy and serves its `dist/app` browser bundle locally with no remote application fallback; production handlers no longer expose an Inspector shell or duplicate proxy implementation.

  - @mcp-use/agent@2.0.0-beta.12

## 20.0.0-beta.16

### Patch Changes

- a3d8591: Make Inspector connection modes authoritative for MCP proxy routing. Auto mode now attempts a direct browser connection before falling back to the configured CORS proxy, Direct mode never uses or falls back to the proxy, and Proxy mode uses it immediately. Clear stale proxy settings when an existing Inspector connection changes modes, keep the server's built-in Inspector on direct origin-level OAuth metadata discovery when no proxy backend is mounted, bypass the browser HTTP cache for OAuth metadata so Origin-specific CORS responses cannot be reused across Inspector origins, make the server-tile Authenticate action clear stored OAuth discovery before starting a fresh flow, and discard authorization-server-generated client secrets from public browser DCR results instead of persisting them.

## 20.0.0-beta.14

### Patch Changes

- 6827ab2: Resolve the current Inspector beta once per page load, then load the entry script, stylesheet, and lazy chunks from the same immutable release. This prevents mixed-version CDN 404s while keeping embedded inspectors on the latest beta.

  - @mcp-use/client@2.0.0-beta.9

## 20.0.0-beta.12

### Patch Changes

- 3aca19c: Prefer Bun over Yarn in the scaffold CLI and docs, and make production source maps opt-in.

  **mcp-use**
  - Add `--source-maps` so `mcp-use build` emits source maps only when requested (server and view bundles default to no maps).
  - Widen `NextConfigLike` with an index signature so `withMcpUse` accepts arbitrary Next.js config fields.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Replace `--yarn` with `--bun`, detect Bun from the user agent, and install/run with Bun when selected.

  **@mcp-use/agent / @mcp-use/client**
  - Point missing-optional-dependency errors at npm, pnpm, or Bun instead of Yarn.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Drop Yarn-specific install/lint scripts from the package scripts surface.

## 20.0.0-beta.9

### Patch Changes

- c878835: Fix duplicated public assets in production builds and remove Scarf telemetry.

  **mcp-use**
  - Set `publicDir: false` on all Vite build steps so project `public/` is copied only to `.mcp-use/build/views/public/` (not duplicated at the build root or inside each view outDir).
  - Raise the view client build `chunkSizeWarningLimit` to reduce noisy warnings for large view bundles.

  **@mcp-use/client**
  - Remove Scarf download telemetry (`captureScarf`, beacon helpers, and related storage); PostHog remains the sole telemetry provider.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Drop inspector package-download Scarf tracking on init; update README and e2e docs to reflect PostHog-only telemetry.

- Updated dependencies [c878835]
  - @mcp-use/client@2.0.0-beta.5
  - @mcp-use/agent@2.0.0-beta.6

## 20.0.0-beta.8

### Patch Changes

- fe4d3b2: Enable MCP view JS code splitting and polish inspector boot UX.

  **mcp-use**
  - Enable rolldown code splitting for per-view client builds (`chunkFileNames` alongside the entry chunk) for external assets and split chunks.
  - Paint a centered boot spinner in the managed inspector shell while the CDN bundle downloads.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Match the boot spinner placeholder in the CDN inspector shell.
  - Add top margin to tool error banners in the result panel.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Fix scaffold README inspector links to `${basePath}/inspector` (`/mcp/inspector` by default).
  - Align the mcp-apps `mcp-env.d.ts` template comment with the auto-generated shim.

## 20.0.0-beta.7

### Patch Changes

- d9c2023: Skip `dev/info` tunnel probes unless `mcp-use dev` injects `window.__MCP_DEV_CLI__`.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Gate tunnel metadata probes on `window.__MCP_DEV_CLI__ === true` instead of treating a missing `__MCP_INSPECTOR_MODE__` as non-standalone.

  **mcp-use**
  - Set `MCP_USE_DEV_CLI` in the dev CLI and inject `window.__MCP_DEV_CLI__ = true` into the inspector CDN shell so embedded dev sessions still sync tunnel state.

## 20.0.0-beta.6

### Patch Changes

- 3294086: Stream partial tool-call arguments into the Inspector drawer and MCP App view while the model is generating them. Anthropic tool requests now opt into eager input streaming, partial JSON healing handles code and SVG strings correctly, hosted chat accepts tool-call start/delta frames, and the view host no longer overwrites newer partial input with a stale complete-input notification.

## 20.0.0-beta.4

### Patch Changes

- f259641: Align view authoring layout, typing shims, and local dev host behavior across the v2 stack.

  **mcp-use**
  - Move file-based view sources from `resources/` to `views/` (wire exposure stays MCP resources).
  - Replace root `tools.d.ts` with `mcp-env.d.ts`, adding CSS module typing plus the live `Register` import shim; dev/build create it exclusively when absent.
  - Simplify favicon selection to the first icon (or explicit `favicon` config).
  - Auto-respawn the dev tunnel on disconnect with exponential backoff and subdomain fallback.

  **@mcp-use/client**
  - Add `mockOpenAiFileApis` on `ViewRenderer` and export `injectOpenAiFileApis` so `useFiles()` works in inspector and other local hosts.
  - Advertise host `message` capability by default.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Enable `mockOpenAiFileApis` in view preview and standalone host props.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Refresh starter, blank, and MCP Apps scaffolds for `views/`, `mcp-env.d.ts`, webp demo assets, and the expanded product-search carousel template.

- Updated dependencies [f259641]
  - @mcp-use/client@2.0.0-beta.3

## 20.0.0-beta.3

### Patch Changes

- b47e268: Raise the Node.js engine floor from `>=20.19.0` to `>=22.13.0` across published packages, scaffolds, examples, CI, Docker, and esbuild/tsup build targets. Use `@types/node` `^22.13.0`. Required for pnpm 11.13 in GitHub Actions and unblocks the beta release workflow.
- 1579839: Raise the Node.js engine floor to `>=22.22.2` (post–March 2026 security release) and pin CI to Node 22.23.1 so trusted npm 12 publishing works.

## 20.0.0-beta.2

### Patch Changes

- e497782: Fix managed chat OAuth forwarding and polish chat UI.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Fix server-side chat for OAuth MCP servers (e.g. Linear): forward live connection tokens when saved auth config is `none`, so hosted chat no longer 401s while Tools stay connected.
  - Add a top scroll fade on the chat message list so content softens under the floating header when scrolling.
  - Center the Manufact cloud / API key tabs in Configure Chat and tighten spacing below them.

## 20.0.0-beta.1

### Patch Changes

- c7accd6: Fix standalone Inspector OAuth and CDN delivery.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Serve the built UI from `dist/cdn/` locally in standalone mode (`pnpm start` / `npx`); embedded mounts still default to jsDelivr `@beta`.
  - Point `pnpm start` at `dist/cli.js` so standalone runs the full proxy + OAuth BFF shell.
  - Skip `dev/info` tunnel probes in standalone mode (route exists only under `mcp-use dev`).
  - Simplify e2e matrix: builtin/prod modes rely on in-process static assets instead of a separate CDN fixture server.
  - Document jsDelivr-first embedding vs local standalone in `docs/inspector/integration.mdx`.

  **@mcp-use/client**
  - Fix Linear (and other OAuth) redirect flows: do not auto-connect saved MCP servers on `/oauth/callback`, which overwrote the PKCE verifier before token exchange.
  - Stop HEAD health-check polling after a 405/404 from servers that only accept POST (reduces console noise for providers like Linear).

- Updated dependencies [c7accd6]
  - @mcp-use/client@2.0.0-beta.1
  - @mcp-use/agent@2.0.0-beta.1

## 20.0.0-beta.0

### Major Changes

- a9ba017: Migrate the client stack to the official MCP TypeScript SDK v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.2`).
  - `@mcp-use/client` now depends on `@modelcontextprotocol/client` instead of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, and is ESM-only (Node 20+). All connectors, sessions, OAuth, and the React `useMcp` hook were ported to the v2 API surface (method-string handlers, `SdkHttpError`/`SdkError`, `OAuthError`, `Headers`, `client/stdio` subpath).
  - Automatic protocol negotiation: HTTP connections default to `versionNegotiation: "auto"` (probe with `server/discover`, transparently falling back to the 2025 `initialize` handshake against v1 servers); stdio defaults to the SDK's v1 mode. The negotiated generation/version is exposed on the connection and `useMcp` result as `protocolEra: "legacy" | "modern"` and `protocolVersion`.
  - OAuth: consolidated `OAuthError`, issuer-stamp round-tripping, `discoveryState()` / `saveDiscoveryState()`, and `iss` validation on the callback (SEP-2352 / RFC 9207).
  - The root `@mcp-use/client` export now selects a browser-safe HTTP implementation outside Node and a Node-enabled implementation under Node. `@mcp-use/client/browser`, `@mcp-use/client/auth`, and `@mcp-use/client/auth/node` were removed; use the root `MCPClient`, `createOAuthProvider`, and React entry instead.
  - Breaking: the Node root entry no longer re-exports `BrowserOAuthClientProvider`, `BrowserOAuthOptions`, or `onMcpAuthorization` (those pull browser/`localStorage` code into the Node graph). Import them from `@mcp-use/client` in a browser bundler (default export condition) or from `@mcp-use/client/react` for the callback helper.
  - `MCPClient.connect()` / `createSession()` auto-provisions OAuth for HTTP servers (via the entry’s `createOAuthProvider`) when no bearer/`authProvider` is set, completes the 401 → consent dance, and retries. Pass `oauth` options or `oauth: false` on the server config; `authProvider` remains an escape hatch. The CLI connect path uses this instead of hand-wiring `NodeOAuthClientProvider`.
  - Breaking: removed v1 aliases (`samplingCallback`, `elicitationCallback`, `auth_token`, `customHeaders`, `clientConfig`, `debug`, `BrowserTelemetry`, and `ResourceTemplate`). Use `onSampling`, `onElicitation`, `authToken`, `headers`, `clientInfo`, `logLevel`, `Telemetry`, and `ResourceTemplateType`.
  - Dependency slimming: removed `posthog-js` / `posthog-node` in favor of a `fetch`-only PostHog capture (no SDK), and dropped `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` (a single MIME-type constant was inlined). `@mcp-use/client` now has a single runtime dependency (`@modelcontextprotocol/client`).
  - The v2 packages use commit-pinned MCP SDK preview builds required by this beta; `@mcp-use/agent` no longer carries the unused v1 `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
  - Runtime verification now covers Node, Deno, browser, and React against real v1 and v2 servers. Browser fetch is explicitly bound, Deno logging does not require env permission, and `useMcp` reaches `ready` only after normalized metadata is populated.
  - Client examples now run against a four-server matrix (official SDK stateful v1/stateless v2 plus mcp-use v1/v2 servers with MCP Apps) and cover notifications, roots, sampling, elicitation, completion, capability negotiation, OAuth, and rendered widgets. HTTP/stdio config now forwards initial roots, SDK client options, default request options, and HTTP connection timeouts to connectors.
  - Fixed legacy Streamable HTTP reverse RPC and notifications: streaming responses are no longer consumed by request logging, and sampling/elicitation use the active request transport. The v2 client auto-opens list-change subscriptions and preserves progress across MRTR retry rounds.
  - `McpClientProvider` now propagates negotiated v1/v2 metadata, auth state, resource templates, and reverse-request queues consistently. Its configured display label is now `displayName`; `name` remains the negotiated server identity.
  - React connections are HTTP-only, reconnect automatically, suppress console logging, and wait for explicit OAuth authentication by default. `clientOptions.capabilities.views: true` advertises MCP Apps support without hand-writing extension capabilities.
  - OAuth and transport proxies now preserve the upstream MCP URL as the SDK resource identity. Removed metadata/resource rewrite shims and gateway-derived OAuth URLs; MCP and OAuth bytes use separate injected fetch adapters.
  - Browser OAuth supports CIMD through `clientMetadataUrl`, keeps DCR as SDK-managed compatibility fallback, stores credentials per authorization-server issuer, and rejects browser client secrets.
  - The Inspector OAuth BFF now binds requests to SDK-discovered metadata/endpoints, fails closed on SSRF/private targets and redirects, caps bodies/timeouts, strips unsafe headers, and restricts CORS origins.
  - Breaking: `@mcp-use/client` is ESM-only and no longer re-exports Zod `*Schema` constants (use `isSpecType` / `specTypeSchemas`). The exported `telFetch` is now a plain non-throwing `fetch` wrapper `(url, init) => Promise<void>` (previously a PostHog `fetch` override). Removed the vendored `JSONSchemaToZod` helper — use Zod 4's native `z.fromJSONSchema()` instead.
  - The inspector and CLI were updated to consume the v2 client; the CLI gains a `--negotiate` flag on `client connect`. The CLI binary is now ESM (`dist/index.js`) since `@mcp-use/client` is ESM-only (`npx mcp-use` is unaffected).
  - Internal `@mcp-use/client` src layout reorganized into semantic folders (`transport/`, flat root client API, `code-mode/`, slim `auth/`, collapsed `react/`); public package exports (`.` and `./react`) and symbol names are unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- b4c192e: Enable localhost managed inspector chat via browser MCPAgent and the cloud LLM proxy. Anonymous users must sign in; authenticated usage draws from Autumn `llm_tokens` credits.

### Patch Changes

- 55a300a: Fix the CDN bundle when served by a backend-less shell (the upcoming
  SDK v2 `/inspector` route):
  - Auto-connect now reads the connect URL the SDK v2 shell injects as
    `window.__MCP_USE_INSPECTOR__.autoConnectUrl` instead of requiring the
    inspector backend's `config.json` endpoint.
  - The version badge and MCP `clientInfo` fall back to the compile-time
    bundle version when `window.__INSPECTOR_VERSION__` is not injected,
    instead of reporting a hardcoded `1.0.0`.

- 430178c: fix(inspector): default connections to Auto mode with proxy fallback

  The Inspector connection form no longer asks users to choose between Direct and
  Via Proxy before connecting. New connections use Auto mode by default: the
  Inspector tries a direct browser connection first, then falls back to the
  configured Inspector proxy when direct connection fails because of CORS or other
  proxy-resolvable connection errors.

  Direct and Proxy are still available as advanced connection mode overrides in
  the Configuration dialog, alongside the editable Proxy Endpoint. The Inspector
  also preserves legacy `connectionType` configs while writing the new
  `connectionMode` field.

  `useMcp` now applies the runtime proxy config after automatic fallback when it
  derives gateway URLs and headers, so fallback retries route through the proxy
  instead of continuing to use the original direct transport config.

- 430178c: Updated dependency `vite` to `^8.0.16`.
- 430178c: fix(inspector): stop prompting signed-in users to log in on the hosted free tier

  The hosted inspector (`inspector.manufact.com`) showed the "You're using
  Manufact's free tier — Sign in to increase your limits" CTA to every visitor
  using the managed LLM, even when they were already authenticated (MCP-2142).

  `ChatTab` now resolves the shared Manufact session (via the new
  `useHostedSession` hook, also used by `HostedUserMenu`) and only renders the
  free-tier sign-in/upgrade chrome for anonymous visitors. The visibility rule is
  extracted into a pure `shouldShowFreeTierUpgrade` helper and unit-tested.

- 430178c: Read the inspector version from package.json so canary builds and CLI version output stay in sync.
- 430178c: Replace stale saved auto-connect entries when the advertised transport changes, so embedded Inspector instances do not keep retrying deprecated SSE connections after switching to streamable HTTP.

Loopback server URLs now fall back to client-side (in-browser) chat streaming, and the configure-key empty state explains why the managed key is unavailable and that a personal API key is needed. The notice only appears in hosted mode; the local inspector is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 83271e8: `mcp-use client screenshot` now auto-sizes screenshots to the widget's natural rendered dimensions when `--width`/`--height` are omitted, eliminating excess whitespace. Fixes screenshotting against external MCP servers (e.g. Excalidraw) — URIs like `ui://excalidraw/mcp-app.html` were breaking the preview route; they are now correctly handled as `<server>-<name>`.
- 83271e8: Integrated Ollama as an LLM provider for the inspector, with local model discovery and streaming chat.

### Patch Changes

- 83271e8: Remove 18 unused inspector source files flagged by the TypeScript workspace Knip check, and stop generating the unused client-side `version.ts` (the client reads the version from the `window.__INSPECTOR_VERSION__` global injected by the server).
- 83271e8: Replace the trailing-slash regex in `normalizeOllamaBaseUrl` with an explicit linear scan. The regex was flagged by CodeQL as a polynomial regular expression on uncontrolled input; the new implementation is unambiguously linear and behaves identically.
- 83271e8: Fix Inspector chat sending an invalid tool `input_schema` to LLM providers after a tool was opened in the Tools tab. `ToolInputForm` was writing `required: boolean` onto each property of the live tool inputSchema during render; that's not valid JSON Schema (`required` belongs on the parent as a `string[]`), and Anthropic's draft 2020-12 validator rejected it with `tools.0.custom.input_schema invalid`. The render now uses a local `isRequired` and no longer mutates the schema.
- 83271e8: Drop unused `TabCountBadge` re-export from the shared barrel; the only consumer imports it directly. Fixes Knip CI on canary.
- 83271e8: Fix cloud chat widget display modes (MCP-2181): native fullscreen on the widget shell with exit navbar; PiP portaled to `document.body` at `z-[100]`. Reconnect AppBridge after sandbox iframe remounts so display-mode toggles do not leave the widget stuck loading. Sets `data-mcp-widget-display-mode` on the document root.
- 83271e8: Improve tab switch animation timing for snappier UI
- 83271e8: Forward MCP image tool results as real image content to the model instead of base64-encoded JSON.

  Previously, when an MCP tool returned an `image` content block, the inspector's chat would `JSON.stringify` the entire result — including the base64 `data` field — and hand that string to the LLM as the tool message body. Vision-capable models couldn't decode the embedded bytes, so they saw a blob of base64 text instead of the picture.

  The conversion now extracts MCP `content` blocks into provider-neutral `ContentPart[]` and forwards image bytes through each provider's vision channel:
  - **Anthropic**: image blocks are embedded inside `tool_result.content` as `{ type: "image", source: { type: "base64", media_type, data } }`.
  - **OpenAI**: the `tool` role keeps a text summary; image bytes are forwarded as a follow-up `user` turn with `image_url` parts (the tool role can't carry images).
  - **Google (Gemini)**: `functionResponse.response` keeps only a text/metadata summary; image bytes are forwarded as a follow-up `user` turn with `inlineData` parts.

  Text-only tool results still take the legacy `content: string` path on every provider, so non-image tools are unaffected. Audio, resource, and resource-link blocks are summarized as text markers (audio bytes are not yet forwarded).

  Note: text-only tool results now reach the model unwrapped (e.g. `"hi"`) instead of as JSON-wrapped `{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"hi"}]}`; on Gemini specifically, `functionResponse.response` is now `{ result: "hi" }` rather than the previous MCP-shaped object.

- 83271e8: fix(inspector): surface MCP server auth failures with a reconnect banner

  When the hosted inspector's chat backend returned 401 because the
  upstream MCP server rejected the user's OAuth token (e.g. Linear token
  expired), the inspector previously threw a generic `HTTP error! status:
401` and the cloud response misleadingly pointed users at the Manufact
  account login.

  The chat now recognises the cloud's `{ error: "mcp_auth_required",
mcpServerUrl }` response and renders an inline banner above the input
  ("Reconnect to <server>") with a button that calls
  `connection.authenticate()`. Reconnect refreshes the OAuth token in
  localStorage; the banner clears on success and chat resumes.

  Pairs with a cloud-side change that drops the misleading `loginUrl`
  field from the 401 response.

- 83271e8: Keep per-tab count badges visible in collapsed header tabs and align them to the right of the tab label. Extract shared `TabCountBadge` styling for mobile and desktop tab rows.
- 83271e8: Add Playwright e2e test covering the inspector's OAuth redirect flow against an emulated Google issuer (via `emulate`), exercising both "Direct" and "Via Proxy" connection types. Test-only — no runtime change.
- 83271e8: Prune unused exports flagged by Knip. Removes 187 unused exports and deletes 19 unused source files across packages. No public API changes — only internal helpers and barrel re-exports that no consumer was using were touched.
- 83271e8: Add a copy button to user messages in the inspector chat.

- 9c3fce4: Fix Inspector chat sending an invalid tool `input_schema` to LLM providers after a tool was opened in the Tools tab. `ToolInputForm` was writing `required: boolean` onto each property of the live tool inputSchema during render; that's not valid JSON Schema (`required` belongs on the parent as a `string[]`), and Anthropic's draft 2020-12 validator rejected it with `tools.0.custom.input_schema invalid`. The render now uses a local `isRequired` and no longer mutates the schema.

### Patch Changes

- 3ed0b4e: fix(inspector): surface MCP server auth failures with a reconnect banner

  When the hosted inspector's chat backend returned 401 because the
  upstream MCP server rejected the user's OAuth token (e.g. Linear token
  expired), the inspector previously threw a generic `HTTP error! status:
401` and the cloud response misleadingly pointed users at the Manufact
  account login.

  The chat now recognises the cloud's `{ error: "mcp_auth_required",
mcpServerUrl }` response and renders an inline banner above the input
  ("Reconnect to <server>") with a button that calls
  `connection.authenticate()`. Reconnect refreshes the OAuth token in
  localStorage; the banner clears on success and chat resumes.

  Pairs with a cloud-side change that drops the misleading `loginUrl`
  field from the 401 response.

### Minor Changes

- 46caf80: feat(cli, inspector): add `mcp-use screenshot` for visual feedback loops on MCP Apps views (MCP-1566)

  `mcp-use screenshot --tool <name> key=value [key2=value2 ...]` calls the tool and renders the result headlessly, saving a PNG of the resulting view. Use `key:=<json>` for nested values, or pass a single JSON object for the legacy form.

  The CLI always spawns a fresh `@mcp-use/inspector` standalone server on a free port (no reuse of whatever happens to be on `localhost:3000`, which could be an unrelated Vite/dev server) and tears it down on exit. It drives the user's existing Chrome / Chromium / Edge / Brave install via the Chrome DevTools Protocol at the new chromeless `/inspector/preview/:view` route inside the inspector SPA. Pass `--inspector <url>` to point at an existing inspector instance; the URL is probed strictly (must return `{ status: "ok" }` JSON on `/inspector/health`) so unrelated servers can't be misidentified. The screenshot pipeline no longer requires being in a project with an MCP server entry — any directory works. Output defaults to `./<view>-<timestamp>.png` in cwd.

  No additional install step or peer dependency is required — the command uses your system Chrome. The browser path is auto-detected on macOS / Linux / Windows; override with `MCP_USE_CHROME_PATH`, `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`, or `CHROME_PATH` if needed.

  The inspector exposes a new internal `<ViewPreview>` component and a `/preview/:view` client-side route. `MCPAppsRenderer` gains an optional `onReady` callback used by the preview route to drive the readiness signal (`body[data-view-ready="true"]`) that the screenshot command waits for before capturing.

  **Session-aware authentication.** Screenshot now reuses sessions saved by `mcp-use client connect`, so a single OAuth flow covers every subsequent screenshot of that server. Replace `--auth <token>` with `--session <name>` (defaults to the active session); `--mcp <url>` remains as an unauthenticated escape hatch. The OAuth token never enters the browser — the CLI calls the tool, reads the widget resource, and injects the result into Chrome via CDP `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` (as `globalThis.__mcpUsePreviewBundle`). The preview route detects the global and renders inline, skipping the browser-side MCP connection entirely.

  **Breaking:** `mcp-use screenshot` flags `--auth` and `--header` are removed. Use `mcp-use client connect <url> --name <name>` (with OAuth) once, then `mcp-use screenshot --tool <name>`.

  **Auto-screenshot in `client tools call`.** When `mcp-use client tools call <name>` invokes a tool that declares a UI resource (`_meta.ui.resourceUri` or `openai/outputTemplate`), the CLI now automatically captures a widget screenshot using the same pipeline as `mcp-use screenshot`. The tool result is reused (no double tool-call) and the dev server is auto-spawned if needed. Pass `--no-screenshot` to opt out, or `--screenshot-output <path>` to override the default `./<view>-<timestamp>.png` path. Screenshot failures print a warning but don't fail the tool call.

  **Remote browser via `--cdp-url`.** `mcp-use screenshot` now accepts `--cdp-url <ws-or-wss-url>` to connect to an existing Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint instead of spawning local Chrome. Useful for hosted Chromium providers (e.g. Notte) so the screenshot pipeline can run in sandboxes without a local browser install. When `--cdp-url` is set, the CLI skips Chrome resolution entirely and uses `Target.setAutoAttach` (rather than the local path's explicit `Target.attachToTarget`, which some hosted providers forbid) to pick up the existing page session. Combine with `--inspector <url>` pointing at a publicly reachable preview deployment so the remote browser can load the widget bundle. The local-Chrome path is unchanged when `--cdp-url` is omitted.

### Patch Changes

- 46caf80: Improve dark mode scrollbar styling and hover visibility in the Inspector UI.
- 46caf80: Resolved duplicate exports flagged by Knip.
  - Annotated the `Tel` alias for `Telemetry` with the `@alias` directive so Knip no longer flags it as a duplicate export. The alias remains available for consumers.
  - Unified the canonical source path for `Telemetry`, `Tel`, `setTelemetrySource`, and `isBrowserEnvironment` in `src/telemetry/index.ts`. The Node implementation is now the default and is swapped for the browser implementation in browser bundles via the existing tsup substitution plugin.
  - Removed the redundant default export of `JsonRpcLoggerView` in `@mcp-use/inspector`. The named export is unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 78cfc8a: Add "OpenAI Compatible" provider option to the inspector chat configuration.

  A new "OpenAI Compatible" entry in the provider dropdown lets users point the inspector chat at any OpenAI-compatible API (e.g. LM Studio, Ollama, OpenRouter). Selecting it exposes a required Base URL field and an optional API key. The standard OpenAI provider is unchanged.

- 78cfc8a: Add OpenRouter as a first-class provider in the inspector chat configuration.

  Selecting "OpenRouter" lets users authenticate with a single OpenRouter API key and access models from multiple upstream providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.). Internally, OpenRouter requests reuse the OpenAI provider with an override base URL and the required `HTTP-Referer` / `X-Title` headers.

- 78cfc8a: Add support for pre-registered OAuth client IDs (proxy mode), including optional client secrets for confidential clients.

  `UseMcpOptions` / `McpServerOptions` now accept an `oauth: { clientId?, clientSecret?, scope? }` field. When `clientId` is provided, `BrowserOAuthClientProvider` returns it from `clientInformation()` so the SDK skips Dynamic Client Registration — required for MCP servers that proxy through providers like Slack or WorkOS, which strip `registration_endpoint` from metadata. When `clientSecret` is also provided, the SDK auto-switches token-endpoint auth from `none` to `client_secret_basic`/`client_secret_post`, which is useful for providers that don't support PKCE. `scope` is forwarded as `clientMetadata.scope`.

  The Inspector's Authentication dialog now has `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, and `Scope` fields, all wired through `addServer` / `updateServer`.

### Patch Changes

- 78cfc8a: fix(inspector): honor `MCP_USE_ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=false` for the
  in-browser `useMcp` posthog-js init.

  Previously the env var only disabled Node-side telemetry and the
  inspector's server-side proxy. The `useMcp` React hook still
  initialized `posthog-js` directly in the browser, sending events to
  `https://eu.i.posthog.com` that ad/tracker blockers would flag.

  The inspector server now mirrors the env var into a per-page runtime
  flag (`window.__MCP_USE_ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY__`) before the client
  bundle runs; both `mcp-use`'s browser telemetry and the inspector's
  own client telemetry honor that flag, so a single env var disables
  every telemetry path. The flag is page-scoped — it leaves no
  persistent state, so unsetting the env var fully restores defaults on
  the next page load. Default behavior (telemetry on) is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 806dbca: fix(inspector): hide Manufact free-tier "Model & usage" dialog when host app embeds `ChatTab` with its own session (MCP-1903)

  The cloud dashboard chat was leaking the hosted inspector's free-tier sign-in / bring-your-own-key modal (plus the "anthropic/server-managed" model badge) even though it passed `hideModelBadge={true}` and already had its own authenticated session and model selector.

  `ChatTab` was auto-deriving `freeTierInfo` from `isManaged` (i.e., the mere presence of `managedLlmConfig`), and both the badge and `ConfigurationDialog` treated `freeTierInfo` as an override that forces the UI back on regardless of `hideModelBadge` / `hideConfigButton`.

  Free-tier upgrade UI is now opt-in via a new `enableFreeTierUpgrade?: boolean` prop on `ChatTab` (default `false`), plumbed through `EmbeddedConfig.chatEnableFreeTierUpgrade`. The hosted inspector (`inspector.manufact.com`) auto-seeds it to `true`; host apps that embed `ChatTab` directly (e.g. the cloud dashboard) leave it off and their hide-\* props are respected.

- 806dbca: fix(inspector): suppress duplicate model UI when embedded with `managedLlmConfig` + `hideModelBadge` (MCP-1913)

  If the user had a bring-your-own-key config in `localStorage`, `effectiveClientSide` became true. The host can pass `managedLlmConfig` and `hideModelBadge` (e.g. cloud dashboard with `ServerChatHeader` + `LLMModelSelector`), but the inspector still showed its own `provider/model` UI: the landing pill below the input, and (in threaded view) `ChatHeader`'s absolute model badge — overlapping the dashboard title and model row.

  When `managedLlmConfig` and `hideModelBadge` are both set, the inspector now suppresses that duplicate chrome in both landing and non-landing views. Standalone hosted behavior is unchanged when the host does not pass this embed pair.

  Additionally, for `useClientSide={false}` + `managedLlmConfig` (host-owned chat stream), the chat path no longer auto-switches to client-side streaming when `localLlmConfig` exists in `localStorage` from a past standalone inspector session. The host’s `chatApiUrl` (e.g. org chat stream) is used unless the user explicitly opts into BYOK (`forceClientSide` via rate-limit / “use your own key”).

- 806dbca: fix(inspector): detect Hono via duck-typing, not `instanceof`

  `mountInspector(app)` chose between a fast Hono-direct path and a slower Express-compat bridge based on `app instanceof Hono`. That check is unreliable across a published library boundary. When this package and the host (e.g. `mcp-use`) resolve different `Hono` constructors (common in monorepos where workspace deps hoist their own `hono`, when Node loads Hono's dual CJS+ESM builds from the same on-disk copy as two separate module records, or under bundler dedup), `instanceof` returns false even for a real Hono app. The Express bridge then runs against a Hono `Context` and crashes on every request trying to read `req.headers.host`:

  ```
  TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'host')
      at .../@mcp-use/inspector/dist/server/chunk-*.js (mountInspector Express bridge)
  ```

  Switch to a duck-type check: Hono apps expose `.fetch(Request) => Response`; Express apps don't. The check is unambiguous for the documented input set and works regardless of which physical Hono module produced the app. Surfaces immediately in the new Next.js drop-in flow (`--mcp-dir`) because Next.js apps almost always pull in a second `hono` through other deps, but the underlying problem applies any time the host and inspector resolve Hono through different module records.

- 806dbca: fix(inspector): OAuth flow no longer leaves two tabs open (#1384)

  Previously, connecting to an OAuth-protected MCP server from the inspector opened the authorization page in a new tab, and after the user authorized the app the callback redirected back to the inspector inside that second tab — leaving the user with two inspector tabs.

  The inspector now uses the same-tab redirect flow (`useRedirectFlow: true`) combined with `preventAutoAuth: true`, so the OAuth authorization page opens in the current tab and the callback navigates the same tab back to the original inspector URL. The user ends up with a single tab.

  The `Authenticate` anchor no longer sets `target="_blank"` / `rel="noopener noreferrer"` — clicking it now navigates the current tab directly to the stored auth URL. All connection entry points in the inspector (`handleAddConnection`, the `Layout` adapter, and the `InspectorDashboard` adapter used by `handleUpdateConnection` on URL edits, as well as `useAutoConnect`) propagate the same flags so the single-tab behavior is consistent across manual connect, URL edits, and auto-connect from shared config.

- 806dbca: Fix OAuth error handling to redirect back to inspector instead of showing raw error page. When OAuth callback receives an error (e.g. user denies access), the callback now looks up the stored state first to retrieve the returnUrl, then redirects back to the inspector with error parameters instead of immediately throwing and displaying a raw error page with stack traces. The inspector surfaces these errors as a persistent App-level toast that fires regardless of the active route.
- 806dbca: Fix MCP App widget overlaying the chat header. Removed the explicit `z-20`/`z-10` stacking context from the sandboxed iframe wrappers in `MCPAppsRenderer` and `OpenAIComponentRenderer` so widgets scroll beneath the chat header instead of painting over it.

The check is unambiguous for the documented input set and works regardless of which physical Hono module produced the app. Surfaces immediately in the new Next.js drop-in flow (`--mcp-dir`) because Next.js apps almost always pull in a second `hono` through other deps, but the underlying problem applies any time the host and inspector resolve Hono through different module records.

- c1ea21a: Fix OAuth error handling to redirect back to inspector instead of showing raw error page. When OAuth callback receives an error (e.g. user denies access), the callback now looks up the stored state first to retrieve the returnUrl, then redirects back to the inspector with error parameters instead of immediately throwing and displaying a raw error page with stack traces. The inspector surfaces these errors as a persistent App-level toast that fires regardless of the active route.

- f41869b: fix(inspector): suppress duplicate model UI when embedded with `managedLlmConfig` + `hideModelBadge` (MCP-1913)

  If the user had a bring-your-own-key config in `localStorage`, `effectiveClientSide` became true. The host can pass `managedLlmConfig` and `hideModelBadge` (e.g. cloud dashboard with `ServerChatHeader` + `LLMModelSelector`), but the inspector still showed its own `provider/model` UI: the landing pill below the input, and (in threaded view) `ChatHeader`'s absolute model badge — overlapping the dashboard title and model row.

  When `managedLlmConfig` and `hideModelBadge` are both set, the inspector now suppresses that duplicate chrome in both landing and non-landing views. Standalone hosted behavior is unchanged when the host does not pass this embed pair.

  Additionally, for `useClientSide={false}` + `managedLlmConfig` (host-owned chat stream), the chat path no longer auto-switches to client-side streaming when `localLlmConfig` exists in `localStorage` from a past standalone inspector session. The host’s `chatApiUrl` (e.g. org chat stream) is used unless the user explicitly opts into BYOK (`forceClientSide` via rate-limit / “use your own key”).

- c864134: fix(inspector): hide Manufact free-tier "Model & usage" dialog when host app embeds `ChatTab` with its own session (MCP-1903)

  The cloud dashboard chat was leaking the hosted inspector's free-tier sign-in / bring-your-own-key modal (plus the "anthropic/server-managed" model badge) even though it passed `hideModelBadge={true}` and already had its own authenticated session and model selector.

  `ChatTab` was auto-deriving `freeTierInfo` from `isManaged` (i.e., the mere presence of `managedLlmConfig`), and both the badge and `ConfigurationDialog` treated `freeTierInfo` as an override that forces the UI back on regardless of `hideModelBadge` / `hideConfigButton`.

  Free-tier upgrade UI is now opt-in via a new `enableFreeTierUpgrade?: boolean` prop on `ChatTab` (default `false`), plumbed through `EmbeddedConfig.chatEnableFreeTierUpgrade`. The hosted inspector (`inspector.manufact.com`) auto-seeds it to `true`; host apps that embed `ChatTab` directly (e.g. the cloud dashboard) leave it off and their hide-\* props are respected.

- a59476b: fix(inspector): OAuth flow no longer leaves two tabs open (#1384)

  Previously, connecting to an OAuth-protected MCP server from the inspector opened the authorization page in a new tab, and after the user authorized the app the callback redirected back to the inspector inside that second tab — leaving the user with two inspector tabs.

  The inspector now uses the same-tab redirect flow (`useRedirectFlow: true`) combined with `preventAutoAuth: true`, so the OAuth authorization page opens in the current tab and the callback navigates the same tab back to the original inspector URL. The user ends up with a single tab.

  The `Authenticate` anchor no longer sets `target="_blank"` / `rel="noopener noreferrer"` — clicking it now navigates the current tab directly to the stored auth URL. All connection entry points in the inspector (`handleAddConnection`, the `Layout` adapter, and the `InspectorDashboard` adapter used by `handleUpdateConnection` on URL edits, as well as `useAutoConnect`) propagate the same flags so the single-tab behavior is consistent across manual connect, URL edits, and auto-connect from shared config.

- e9c4bd0: fix(inspector): remove `@langchain/*` hard dependencies and drop `MCPAgent` usage

  Closes [mcp-use/mcp-use#1371](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/issues/1371).

  `@mcp-use/inspector` no longer depends on `@langchain/core`, `@langchain/openai`, `@langchain/anthropic`, or `@langchain/google-genai`. The chat, sampling, and props-generation paths now call the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google REST APIs directly and run their own MCP tool-calling loop instead of going through `MCPAgent`. Consumers of `mcp-use` (which transitively installs the inspector) no longer need langchain in their `node_modules` and Next.js / Vite / other bundlers no longer fail at runtime with `Cannot find package 'langchain'`.

  Preserved behavior:
  - SSE wire format of the inspector's `/inspector/api/chat/stream` endpoint is unchanged (`message` / `text` / `tool-call` / `tool-result` / `done` / `error` events with identical field shapes), so existing clients — including remote consumers and the Vercel AI SDK `data-stream` parser in `useChatMessages` — keep working.
  - Tool execution, multimodal image attachments, streaming partial-args rendering, OpenAI Apps SDK `openai/outputTemplate` resource hydration, cancellation via `AbortSignal`, prompts, elicitation, and widget `ui/update-model-context` injection all behave the same as before.

  Provider notes:
  - Gemini does not stream partial tool-call arguments incrementally (the provider only emits fully-formed `functionCall.args`), so the progressive partial-args animation only updates once per tool call for the `google` provider. Final behavior is identical.
  - MCP tool schemas are automatically sanitized before being sent to Gemini to strip keywords it rejects (`$schema`, `additionalProperties`, `$ref`, etc.).
  - A new regression test in `mcp-use/tests/inspector-no-langchain.test.ts` fails if any `@langchain/*`, `langchain`, or `MCPAgent` reference re-enters the inspector's `package.json` or built `dist/**`.

### Patch Changes

- e9c4bd0: fix(inspector): read `MANUFACT_CHAT_URL` in the standalone server entrypoint

  The runtime hosted-chat URL injection was wired up in `cli.ts` (used by the published `mcp-inspect` bin and by Railway) but the same plumbing in `server.ts` (used by `pnpm start` / the dev server) was dropped during a merge. As a result, running the inspector via `node dist/server/server.js` with `MANUFACT_CHAT_URL` set did not inject `window.__MANUFACT_CHAT_URL__` into the served HTML.

  This change restores parity between the two entrypoints so both honour the env var at process start.

- e9c4bd0: feat(inspector): configure hosted chat URL at runtime via `MANUFACT_CHAT_URL`

  The hosted chat endpoint (`chatApiUrl`) previously had to be baked into the client bundle at `vite build` time via `VITE_MANUFACT_CHAT_URL`. This prevented the same pre-built npm tarball from being configured per deploy (Railway, CDN, self-hosted) without a rebuild.

  The inspector server now reads `MANUFACT_CHAT_URL` at runtime and injects `window.__MANUFACT_CHAT_URL__` into the served HTML. `InspectorProvider` prefers the runtime value and falls back to `VITE_MANUFACT_CHAT_URL` for local Vite dev, so existing build-time flows keep working.

  Also drops `noopener` from the LoginModal OAuth popup and redirects the OAuth `callbackURL` to a new `/inspector/oauth-popup-closed.html` page so the popup self-closes cleanly instead of briefly loading the full inspector inside it.

  **mcp-use:** Add `defaultCallbackUrl` prop to `McpClientProvider` so apps mounted at a sub-path (e.g. `/inspector`) can declare the correct OAuth redirect URL once at the provider level instead of passing it to every `addServer` call.

  **inspector:** Pass `defaultCallbackUrl` pointing to `/inspector/oauth/callback`, which is where the React Router (with `basename="/inspector"`) mounts the `OAuthCallback` component. Previously the callback URL defaulted to `/oauth/callback`, causing a blank screen after OAuth because the route was never matched. The "Redirect URL" field has been removed from the authentication dialog — it was never wired to the actual connection and could not be set to a path the inspector would handle.

### Patch Changes

- 6d7c4df: Add `updateServerMetadata()` to `McpClientProvider` for metadata-only updates that do not trigger a reconnection.

  `updateServer()` continues to disconnect and remount the connection for any connection-affecting change (URL, headers, proxy, transport). `updateServerMetadata(id, { name })` updates the configured display name in place without touching the live connection.

  The Inspector uses this new path to let users set editable server aliases in the connection settings dialog. Alias-only edits no longer cause a full reconnect. All Inspector surfaces (dashboard tiles, server dropdown, header export actions, command palette, server info modal, server icon) now resolve the display name through a shared `getServerDisplayName` utility that prefers user-set aliases over server-reported metadata.

  Also fixes an IME composition issue where pressing `Enter` during Chinese/Japanese/Korean input could accidentally submit the connection form.

### Patch Changes

- 0ec6068: Restore mcp-use as both a dependency and peerDependency. The dependency is needed for tsup to bundle non-React subpaths (mcp-use/auth, mcp-use/browser) with their transitive deps (langchain). The peerDependency ensures mcp-use/react types are shared with the host app.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 6255bbd: Move mcp-use from dependencies to peerDependencies in @mcp-use/inspector. This ensures consumers share a single copy of mcp-use types, fixing TS2322 errors caused by pnpm creating multiple peer-variant copies with nominally-incompatible private/protected class members. Also add stripInternal to mcp-use tsconfig and mark internal class members with @internal to reduce .d.ts surface area.
- 6255bbd: Upgrade @mcp-ui/client from ^6.1.0 to ^7.0.0. Replace removed UIResourceRenderer with sandboxed iframes for legacy ui:// resources. Drop remote-dom support (removed upstream). MCP Apps rendering via MCPAppsRenderer is unaffected.

## 0.25.1

### Patch Changes

- 7d2112e: Add `fallback` and `onError` props to ErrorBoundary

  The `ErrorBoundary` component now accepts an optional `fallback` prop (`ReactNode` or `(error: Error) => ReactNode`) for custom error UI, and an `onError` callback for error reporting. When no fallback is provided, the default red error card is shown (backward compatible).

- 7d2112e: Preserve tool call results (including `structuredContent`) in Inspector chat history across conversation turns

  Previously, `convertMessagesToLangChain` only emitted `HumanMessage` and `AIMessage`, dropping all tool invocation data when reconstructing conversation history. This meant the model lost context about previous tool calls and their results on subsequent turns.

  Now, assistant messages with tool-invocation parts are properly reconstructed as an `AIMessage` with `tool_calls` followed by `ToolMessage` objects for each completed invocation. The `_meta` field is stripped from tool results before they reach the model, while `structuredContent` and all other fields are preserved.

### Minor Changes

- b76df33: feat(tunnel): added ability to start/stop the mcp-use dev tunnel from the inspector
- b76df33: Upgrade to Vite 8 with Rolldown bundler and fix all test failures

  **Vite 8 upgrade:**
  - Upgrade `vite` from v7.3.x to v8.0.0 across all packages and examples
  - Upgrade `@vitejs/plugin-react` from v5 to v6 (Oxc-based transforms)
  - Migrate `rollupOptions` to `rolldownOptions` in all vite configs
  - Migrate `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions` to `optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions`
  - Remove deprecated `build.commonjsOptions` (no-op in Vite 8)
  - Switch programmatic `minify: "esbuild"` to `minify: true` (Oxc minifier)
  - Extract `loadConfigFile` from `config.ts` into `config-file.ts` to prevent `require("fs")` leaking into browser bundles

  **Test fixes (35 pre-existing failures):**
  - Telemetry tests: add `vi.resetModules()`, async flush for fire-and-forget tracking, `type: "ai"` on agent mocks, missing adapter methods
  - response-helpers tests: update widget() assertions from `_meta["mcp-use/props"]` to `structuredContent` per SEP-1865
  - HMR tests: add widget config markers, mock `registerPrompt`/`registerResource` on sessions, update error message assertions
  - ai_sdk_compatibility test: fix `StreamEvent` import to `@langchain/core/tracers/log_stream`
  - distributed-stream-routing test: use OS-assigned ports instead of fixed port to eliminate EADDRINUSE race condition
  - browser-react-no-node-deps test: fix `execSync` → `execFileSync` call

  **CI fix:**
  - Quote glob in `test:unit` script (`'tests/integration/**'`) to prevent shell expansion that was causing unit tests to be silently skipped in CI
  - Add missing dev dependencies: `ai`, `morgan`, `@types/morgan`, `express-rate-limit`

### Patch Changes

- b76df33: fix: map elicit result `content` to `data` for Zod validation

  The MCP SDK returns form data in `result.content` per the elicitation spec, but
  `createElicitMethod` was checking `result.data` which is always undefined from
  spec-compliant clients. This caused Zod validation to never run, leaving
  `result.data` as undefined for tool callbacks using `ctx.elicit()` with a Zod
  schema.

  Now reads `result.content` (with fallback to `result.data` for backward
  compatibility) and always maps accepted form data to `result.data` so the typed
  API works correctly. Also fixes the inspector to send `content` instead of
  `data` per the MCP spec.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 405fac7: feat: ctx.client.user(), MCP Apps capabilities fix, CLI tunnel inspector fix

  ### mcp-use

  **ctx.client.user()** — new per-invocation method on the tool context that extracts
  end-user metadata from `tools/call` `params._meta` (e.g. ChatGPT `openai/*` keys).
  Returns `undefined` on clients that don't send request-level metadata. The `UserContext`
  type is exported from `mcp-use/server`.

  ChatGPT runs a single MCP session for all users of a deployed app — use
  `ctx.client.user()?.subject` to identify the user and `?.conversationId` for the thread.

  **MCP Apps capabilities fix** — patched the MCP SDK's `ClientCapabilitiesSchema` to
  preserve the `extensions` field (previously stripped by Zod's default `$strip` mode),
  so `ctx.client.supportsApps()` now correctly returns `true` for clients that advertise
  `io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`.

  **Session isolation fix** — `findSessionContext` no longer falls back to an arbitrary
  session when the correct one can't be matched, preventing metadata leakage in
  multi-connection scenarios.

  ### @mcp-use/inspector

  The Inspector now advertises MCP Apps support (`io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`) in its
  `clientInfo.capabilities`. The `capabilities` field on `McpClientProvider.clientInfo`
  is a new provider-level default that applies to all server connections, including those
  restored from localStorage.

  ### @mcp-use/cli

  Fixed: the Inspector's `?autoConnect=` URL now uses the tunnel endpoint when
  `--tunnel` is active, instead of always pointing to `localhost`.

- 455c18f: Add `exposeResourcesAsTools` and `exposePromptsAsTools` options to `MCPAgentOptions` (both default to `true` for backward compatibility). The inspector chat tab now sets both to `false`, so the agent only exposes actual MCP tools to the LLM rather than fabricating tool wrappers for resources and prompts.

### Patch Changes

- 3d787ba: Improve reverse proxy support, HMR reliability, and widget handling across the stack.

  ### `mcp-use` (minor)
  - **Custom HTTP route HMR:** Routes registered via `server.get()`, `server.post()`, etc. now support hot module replacement — handlers are hot-swapped without a server restart.
  - **Widget tool protection during HMR:** Widget-registered tools are no longer accidentally removed when `index.ts` HMR sync runs. Tools tagged with `_meta["mcp-use/widget"]` are preserved.
  - **Dynamic widget creation:** The `resources/` directory is auto-created if missing, and the dev server watches for new widgets even if none exist at startup. This enables workflows where widgets are created after the server starts
  - **Vite HMR WebSocket proxy:** A TCP-level WebSocket proxy forwards HMR `upgrade` requests from the main HTTP server to Vite's internal HMR port, enabling hot-reload through reverse proxies (ngrok, E2B, Cloudflare tunnels).
  - **`MCP_URL` environment variable:** Can now be pre-set by users to an external proxy URL. The CLI will not overwrite it, allowing correct widget URLs and HMR WebSocket connections behind reverse proxies.
  - **List-changed notifications on removal:** `sendToolListChanged()`, `sendResourceListChanged()`, and `sendPromptListChanged()` now also fire when items are removed, not just added/updated.
  - **Pre-initialized request handlers:** Tool, prompt, and resource request handlers are pre-registered during session initialization, preventing `Method not found` errors when clients connect to servers that start with zero registrations and add them dynamically.
  - **Widget type default changed:** Widgets now default to `mcpApps` (dual-protocol) instead of `appsSdk`. Only widgets with explicit `appsSdkMetadata` and no `metadata` field use the `appsSdk` type.
  - **`window.__mcpServerUrl` global:** Injected into widget HTML so widgets can dynamically construct API URLs (e.g., `fetch(window.__mcpServerUrl + '/api/data')`).

  ### `@mcp-use/inspector` (patch)
  - **`MCP_INSPECTOR_FRAME_ANCESTORS` env var:** Controls which origins can embed the inspector in iframes via CSP `frame-ancestors`. Defaults to `*` in development and `'self'` in production.
  - **`mountInspector` configuration options:** Accepts new `devMode` (boolean) and `sandboxOrigin` (string | null) options for controlling sandbox behavior in different deployment environments.
  - **Runtime config injection:** `__MCP_DEV_MODE__` and `__MCP_SANDBOX_ORIGIN__` window globals are injected into the served HTML at runtime, enabling client-side configuration without rebuild.
  - **Localhost URL conversion:** Server-side fetches of widget HTML now convert external proxy URLs to `localhost` to avoid reverse proxy catch-all routes returning SPA HTML instead of Vite-served widget content.
  - **Simplified URL rewriting:** Widget asset URLs are now rewritten to bare server-relative paths that resolve directly through Vite middleware, improving reliability behind reverse proxies.
  - **Fixed infinite re-render loop:** Removed excessive `useEffect` dependencies in `MCPAppsRenderer` that caused continuous re-fetching of widget HTML.

  ### `@mcp-use/cli` (patch)
  - **Respect user-provided `MCP_URL`:** The CLI no longer overwrites `MCP_URL` if already set, allowing users to configure external proxy URLs for reverse proxy setups.

- 3d787ba: fix(inspector): update sandbox permissions for McpUIRenderer and MCPUIResource components

  - **Widget type default changed:** Widgets now default to `mcpApps` (dual-protocol) instead of `appsSdk`. Only widgets with explicit `appsSdkMetadata` and no `metadata` field use the `appsSdk` type.
  - **`window.__mcpServerUrl` global:** Injected into widget HTML so widgets can dynamically construct API URLs (e.g., `fetch(window.__mcpServerUrl + '/api/data')`).

  ### `@mcp-use/inspector` (patch)
  - **`MCP_INSPECTOR_FRAME_ANCESTORS` env var:** Controls which origins can embed the inspector in iframes via CSP `frame-ancestors`. Defaults to `*` in development and `'self'` in production.
  - **`mountInspector` configuration options:** Accepts new `devMode` (boolean) and `sandboxOrigin` (string | null) options for controlling sandbox behavior in different deployment environments.
  - **Runtime config injection:** `__MCP_DEV_MODE__` and `__MCP_SANDBOX_ORIGIN__` window globals are injected into the served HTML at runtime, enabling client-side configuration without rebuild.
  - **Localhost URL conversion:** Server-side fetches of widget HTML now convert external proxy URLs to `localhost` to avoid reverse proxy catch-all routes returning SPA HTML instead of Vite-served widget content.
  - **Simplified URL rewriting:** Widget asset URLs are now rewritten to bare server-relative paths that resolve directly through Vite middleware, improving reliability behind reverse proxies.
  - **Fixed infinite re-render loop:** Removed excessive `useEffect` dependencies in `MCPAppsRenderer` that caused continuous re-fetching of widget HTML.

  ### `@mcp-use/cli` (patch)
  - **Respect user-provided `MCP_URL`:** The CLI no longer overwrites `MCP_URL` if already set, allowing users to configure external proxy URLs for reverse proxy setups.

- Updated dependencies [4a03ce0]
  - mcp-use@1.17.0-canary.0

  - Improves workflow when testing server changes or investigating stale data

  Commits: 03238f28

- ac3e216: fix(inspector): solved cold start issue for widgets
- ac3e216: chore(inspector): add E2E test suite, default port 3000 when not in dev, skip telemetry in test env, and data-testid for testability

  **E2E Testing Infrastructure:**
  - Added comprehensive Playwright-based E2E testing suite with full coverage for:
    - Chat functionality and message handling
    - Connection management and authentication flows (OAuth, API key, custom headers)
    - HMR (Hot Module Reload) for tools, prompts, and resources
    - UI widgets and lifecycle states
    - Command palette and debugger tools

  - Tests run across multiple modes: mix (SSE + WebSocket), prod (HTTP only), builtin (no connection)
  - Improved Playwright configuration with CI-optimized timeouts

  **Testability Improvements:**
  - Added `data-testid` attributes across 40+ UI components for reliable element selection:
    - Connection forms, server list, command palette
    - Chat interface, tool execution panels
    - Resources, prompts, and tools tabs
    - Elicitation and sampling displays
  - Enhanced component accessibility for automated testing

  **Server Improvements:**
  - Changed default port from 3001 to 3000 for production builds (dev still uses 3001)

  **Connection Handling:**
  - Enhanced Layout component to detect when `server=` URL parameter is provided but no matching connection exists
  - Automatically redirects to use `autoConnect=` parameter for seamless connection establishment
  - Updated dependencies in useEffect hook to include connections and navigate for improved functionality

  **Documentation:**
  - Added comprehensive URL parameters documentation page to inspector reference
  - Included examples and usage patterns for `server=`, `autoConnect=`, and other query parameters

  Resolves #932

- ac3e216: chore(deps): upgrade @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to 1.26.0

  **Dependencies:**
  - Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from `^1.25.3` to `^1.26.0`
  - Applied the same Zod 4 compatibility patch to SDK 1.26.0
  - Removed old SDK 1.25.3 patch file

  **Patch Details:**

  The SDK still requires a patch to fix Zod 4 compatibility in the `zod-compat.js` module. The patch ensures that Zod 4 schemas use their instance methods (`schema.safeParse()`) instead of attempting to call non-existent top-level functions (`z4mini.safeParse()`).

  This is a drop-in replacement upgrade with no breaking changes.

- Updated dependencies [708f6e5]
  - mcp-use@1.12.3-canary.0

## 0.14.2

### Patch Changes

- 198fffd: Add configurable clientInfo support for MCP connection initialization. Clients can now customize how they identify themselves to MCP servers with full metadata including name, title, version, description, icons, and website URL. The clientConfig option is deprecated in favor of deriving it from clientInfo. Default clientInfo is set for mcp-use, inspector sets "mcp-use Inspector" with its own version, and CLI sets "mcp-use CLI".
- 198fffd: feat(inspector): add reconnect functionality for failed connections
  - Introduced a reconnect button in the InspectorDashboard for connections that fail, allowing users to attempt reconnection directly from the UI.
  - Enhanced the dropdown menu to include a reconnect option for failed connections, improving user experience and accessibility.
  - Updated HttpConnector to disable automatic reconnection, shifting the responsibility to higher-level logic for better control over connection management.

- 198fffd: chore: updated docs
- 198fffd: Fix custom headers not being included when copying connection configuration from saved connection tiles. Headers are now correctly read from localStorage where they are stored in proxyConfig.customHeaders.
- 198fffd: ## Breaking Changes (with Deprecation Warnings)
  - **Renamed `customHeaders` to `headers`**: The `customHeaders` option has been renamed to `headers` across all APIs for better consistency. The old name still works but shows deprecation warnings. Update your code to use `headers` instead.
  - **Renamed `samplingCallback` to `onSampling`**: Callback naming is now more consistent with event handler patterns. The old name still works but shows deprecation warnings.

  ## New Features
  - **Automatic Proxy Fallback**: Added `autoProxyFallback` option to `useMcp` hook and `McpClientProvider`. When enabled (default: `true` in provider), automatically retries failed connections through a proxy when CORS errors or HTTP 4xx errors are detected. This makes connecting to MCP servers much more reliable in browser environments.
  - **Provider-Level Proxy Defaults**: `McpClientProvider` now supports `defaultProxyConfig` and `defaultAutoProxyFallback` props to set proxy configuration for all servers. Individual servers can override these defaults.
  - **OAuth Proxy Support**: Added OAuth request proxying through fetch interceptor in `BrowserOAuthClientProvider`. Configure with `oauthProxyUrl` to route OAuth discovery and token requests through your backend proxy.

  ## Improvements
  - **Enhanced Error Detection**: Better detection of OAuth discovery failures, CORS errors, and connection issues
  - **Smarter Connection Logic**: OAuth provider now always uses the original target URL for OAuth discovery, not the proxy URL
  - **Better Session Management**: Improved session cleanup to avoid noisy warning logs
  - **Type Safety**: Added deprecation notices in TypeScript types for deprecated options
  - **Proxy Header Support**: `proxyConfig` now accepts a `headers` field for custom headers to the proxy

  ## Refactoring
  - **Removed `oauth-helper.ts`** (521 lines): OAuth helper utilities consolidated into `browser-provider.ts`
  - **Removed `react_example.html`**: Outdated example file removed
  - **Major `useMcp` Hook Refactor**: Complete rewrite of connection logic with automatic retry, better error handling, and proxy fallback support

  ## Documentation
  - Updated all client documentation to use new `headers` naming
  - Added comprehensive examples for automatic proxy fallback
  - Updated sampling documentation with new `onSampling` callback name
  - Refreshed React integration guide with provider-based approach

### Minor Changes

- 53fb670: ## Multi-Server Support and Architecture Improvements

  ### Features
  - **Multi-server management**: Introduced `McpClientProvider` to manage multiple MCP server connections, allowing dynamic addition and removal of servers in React applications
  - **Storage providers**: Added pluggable storage system with `LocalStorageProvider` and `MemoryStorageProvider` for flexible server configuration persistence
  - **Enhanced RPC logging**: New `rpc-logger` module with filtering capabilities to reduce noisy endpoint logging (telemetry, RPC streams)
  - **Browser support**: Exported `MCPAgent` for browser usage with `BrowserMCPClient` instance or through `RemoteAgent`

  ### Inspector Enhancements
  - **Improved UI responsiveness**: Enhanced mobile and tablet layouts with adaptive component visibility
  - **Better server management**: Refactored server connection handling with improved icon display and status tracking
  - **Enhanced debugging**: Added detailed logging in Layout and useAutoConnect components for better monitoring of server connection states
  - **Simplified connection settings**: Removed deprecated transport types for cleaner configuration

  ### Architecture Changes
  - Removed obsolete `McpContext` (replaced with `McpClientProvider`)
  - Refactored `useMcp` hook for better multi-server support
  - Updated components across inspector for cleaner architecture and imports

  ### Bug Fixes
  - Fixed server connection retrieval in `OpenAIComponentRenderer` to directly access connections array

- 53fb670: chore: make broser bundle node js free
- 53fb670: feat(inspector): added support for prompt rendering and add to client dropdown
- 53fb670: feat: remove Node.js dependencies and improve browser compatibility

  This release removes Node.js-specific dependencies and significantly improves browser compatibility across the mcp-use ecosystem.

  ## Breaking Changes
  - **Logging**: Removed `winston` dependency. The logging system now uses a simple console logger that works in both browser and Node.js environments.

  ## New Features

  ### Browser Runtime Support
  - **Browser Telemetry**: Added `telemetry-browser.ts` that uses `posthog-js` for browser environments, separate from Node.js telemetry
  - **Browser Entry Point**: Enhanced `browser.ts` entry point with improved browser-specific utilities
  - **Browser Utilities**: Added new utilities:
    - `utils/favicon-detector.ts` - Detect and extract favicons from URLs
    - `utils/proxy-config.ts` - Proxy configuration utilities for browser environments
    - `utils/mcpClientUtils.ts` - MCP client utilities moved from client package

  ### React Components
  - **AddToClientDropdown**: New React component (`src/react/AddToClientDropdown.tsx`) for adding MCP servers to clients with enhanced UI and functionality

  ### Server Middleware
  - **MCP Proxy Middleware**: Added `server/middleware/mcp-proxy.ts` - Hono middleware for proxying MCP server requests with optional authentication and request validation

  ### Inspector Improvements
  - Enhanced inspector components for better browser compatibility
  - Improved server icon support and component interactions
  - Added embedded mode support
  - Better configuration handling and MCP proxy integration

  ## Refactoring
  - **Telemetry Split**: Separated telemetry into `telemetry-browser.ts` (browser) and `telemetry-node.ts` (Node.js) for better environment-specific implementations
  - **Logging Refactor**: Replaced Winston with `SimpleConsoleLogger` that works across all environments
  - **Build Configuration**: Updated `tsup.config.ts` to exclude Node.js-specific dependencies (`winston`, `posthog-node`) from browser builds
  - **Package Dependencies**: Removed `winston` and related Node.js-only dependencies from `package.json`

  ## Testing
  - Added comprehensive test (`browser-react-no-node-deps.test.ts`) to ensure `mcp-use/react` and `mcp-use/browser` do not import Node.js dependencies

  This release makes mcp-use fully compatible with browser environments while maintaining backward compatibility with Node.js applications.

  - Added support for client exports in the build process by introducing a new build script for client exports in `package.json`.
  - Enhanced the `CommandPalette` and `SdkIntegrationModal` components to utilize local utility functions instead of external dependencies.
  - Introduced a new CSS animation for status indicators in `index.css`.
  - Updated the `LayoutHeader` component to conditionally display notification dots based on tab activity.
  - Removed the deprecated `AddToClientDropdown` component and adjusted related imports accordingly.
  - Improved client configuration examples in the `notification-client` and `sampling-client` files to include client identification for better server-side logging.
  - Cleaned up unused imports and ensured consistent formatting across several files.

  ### LangChain Adapter Export Path Changed

  The LangChain adapter is no longer exported from the main entry point. Import from `mcp-use/adapters` instead:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { LangChainAdapter } from "mcp-use";

  // After
  import { LangChainAdapter } from "mcp-use/adapters";
  ```

  **Note:** `@langchain/core` and `langchain` moved from dependencies to optional peer dependencies.

  **Learn more:** [LangChain Integration](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/agent/llm-integration)

  ### WebSocket Transport Removed

  WebSocket transport support has been removed. Use streamable HTTP or SSE transports instead.

  **Learn more:** [Client Configuration](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/client/client-configuration)

  ## Features

  ### Session Management Architecture with Redis Support

  Implements a pluggable session management architecture enabling distributed deployments with cross-server notifications, sampling, and resource subscriptions.

  **New Interfaces:**
  - `SessionStore` - Pluggable interface for storing session metadata
    - `InMemorySessionStore` (production default)
    - `FileSystemSessionStore` (dev mode default)
    - `RedisSessionStore` (distributed deployments)
  - `StreamManager` - Manages active SSE connections
    - `InMemoryStreamManager` (default)
    - `RedisStreamManager` (distributed via Redis Pub/Sub)

  **Server Configuration:**

  ```typescript
  // Development (default - FileSystemSessionStore for hot reload)
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "dev-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
  });

  // Production distributed (cross-server notifications)
  import { RedisSessionStore, RedisStreamManager } from "mcp-use/server";
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "prod-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    sessionStore: new RedisSessionStore({ client: redis }),
    streamManager: new RedisStreamManager({
      client: redis,
      pubSubClient: pubSubRedis,
    }),
  });
  ```

  **Client Improvements:**
  - Auto-refresh tools/resources/prompts when receiving list change notifications
  - Manual refresh methods: `refreshTools()`, `refreshResources()`, `refreshPrompts()`, `refreshAll()`
  - Automatic 404 handling and re-initialization per MCP spec

  **Convenience Methods:**
  - `sendToolsListChanged()` - Notify clients when tools list changes
  - `sendResourcesListChanged()` - Notify clients when resources list changes
  - `sendPromptsListChanged()` - Notify clients when prompts list changes

  **Development Experience:**
  - FileSystemSessionStore persists sessions to `.mcp-use/sessions.json` in dev mode
  - Sessions survive server hot reloads
  - Auto-cleanup of expired sessions (>24 hours)

  **Deprecated:**
  - `autoCreateSessionOnInvalidId` - Now follows MCP spec strictly (returns 404 for invalid sessions)

  **Learn more:** [Session Management](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/server/session-management)

  ### Favicon Support for Widgets

  Added favicon configuration for widget pages:

  ```typescript
  const server = createMCPServer({
    name: "my-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    favicon: "favicon.ico", // Path relative to public/ directory
  });
  ```

  - Favicon automatically served at `/favicon.ico` for entire server domain
  - CLI build process includes favicon in widget HTML pages
  - Long-term caching (1 year) for favicon assets

  **Learn more:** [UI Widgets](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/server/ui-widgets) and [Server Configuration](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/server/configuration)

  ### CLI Client Support

  Added dedicated CLI client support for better command-line integration and testing.

  **Learn more:** [CLI Client](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/client/cli)

  ### Enhanced Session Methods
  - `callTool()` method now defaults args to an empty object
  - New `requireSession()` method for reliable session retrieval

  ## Improvements

  ### Widget Build System
  - Automatic cleanup of stale widget directories in `.mcp-use` folder
  - Dev mode watches for widget file/directory deletions and cleans up build artifacts

  ### Dependency Management
  - Added support for Node >= 18
  - Added CommonJS module support

  ### Documentation & Metadata
  - Updated agent documentation and method signatures
  - Added repository metadata to package.json

  ## Fixes

  ### Widget Fixes
  - Fixed widget styling isolation - widgets no longer pick up mcp-use styles
  - Fixed favicon URL generator for proper asset resolution

  ### React Router Migration

  Migrated from `react-router-dom` to `react-router` for better compatibility and reduced bundle size.

  **Learn more:** [useMcp Hook](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/client/usemcp)

  ### Session & Transport Fixes
  - Fixed transport cleanup when session becomes idle
  - Fixed agent access to resources and prompts

  ### Code Quality
  - Formatting and linting improvements across packages

- 8a2e84e: ## Inspector: Faster Direct-to-Proxy Fallback
  - **Reduced connection timeout from 30s to 5s** for faster fallback when direct connections fail
  - **Removed automatic HTTP → SSE transport fallback** since SSE is deprecated
    - Added `disableSseFallback` option to `HttpConnector` to prevent automatic fallback to SSE transport
    - Inspector now explicitly uses HTTP transport only, relying on Direct → Proxy fallback instead
    - Users can still manually select SSE transport if needed
  - **Total fallback time: ~6 seconds** (5s timeout + 1s delay) instead of ~31 seconds

  ## Deployment: Fixed Supabase Health Check
  - **Fixed deploy.sh MCP server health check** to use POST instead of GET
    - SSE endpoints hang on GET requests, causing script to timeout
    - POST requests return immediately (415 error), proving server is up
    - Script now correctly detects when deployment is complete and shows success summary with URLs

- 6ec11cd: ## Breaking Changes
  - **Server API**: Renamed `createMCPServer()` factory function to `MCPServer` class constructor. The factory function is still available for backward compatibility but new code should use `new MCPServer({ name, ... })`.
  - **Session API**: Replaced `session.connector.tools`, `session.connector.callTool()`, etc. with direct methods: `session.tools`, `session.callTool()`, `session.listResources()`, `session.readResource()`, etc.
  - **OAuth Environment Variables**: Standardized OAuth env vars to `MCP_USE_OAUTH_*` prefix (e.g., `AUTH0_DOMAIN` → `MCP_USE_OAUTH_AUTH0_DOMAIN`).

  ## New Features
  - **Client Capabilities API**: Added `ctx.client.can()` and `ctx.client.capabilities()` to check client capabilities in tool callbacks.
  - **Session Notifications**: Added `ctx.sendNotification()` and `ctx.sendNotificationToSession()` for sending notifications from tool callbacks.
  - **Session Info**: Added `ctx.session.sessionId` to access current session ID in tool callbacks.
  - **Resource Template Flat Structure**: Resource templates now support flat structure with `uriTemplate` directly on definition (in addition to nested structure).
  - **Resource Template Callback Signatures**: Resource template callbacks now support multiple signatures: `()`, `(uri)`, `(uri, params)`, `(uri, params, ctx)`.
  - **Type Exports**: Added exports for `CallToolResult`, `Tool`, `ToolAnnotations`, `PromptResult`, `GetPromptResult` types.

  ## Improvements
  - **Type Inference**: Enhanced type inference for resource template callbacks with better overload support.
  - **Client Capabilities Tracking**: Server now captures and stores client capabilities during initialization.
  - **Session Methods**: Added convenience methods to `MCPSession` for all MCP operations (listResources, readResource, subscribeToResource, listPrompts, getPrompt, etc.).
  - **Documentation**: Major documentation refactoring and restructuring for better organization.

### Minor Changes

- 26e1162: Migrated mcp-use server from Express to Hono framework to enable edge runtime support (Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Supabase Edge Functions). Added runtime detection for Deno/Node.js environments, Connect middleware adapter for compatibility, and `getHandler()` method for edge deployment. Updated dependencies: added `hono` and `@hono/node-server`, moved `connect` and `node-mocks-http` to optional dependencies, removed `express` and `cors` from peer dependencies.

  Added Supabase deployment documentation and example templates to create-mcp-use-app for easier edge runtime deployment.

- 26e1162: ### MCPAgent Message Detection Improvements (fix #446)

  Fixed issue where `agent.run()` returned "No output generated" even when valid output was produced, caused by messages not being AIMessage instances after serialization/deserialization across module boundaries. Added robust message detection helpers (`_isAIMessageLike`, `_isHumanMessageLike`, `_isToolMessageLike`) that handle multiple message formats (class instances, plain objects with `type`/`role` properties, objects with `getType()` methods) to support version mismatches and different LangChain message formats. Includes comprehensive test coverage for message detection edge cases.

  ### Server Base URL Fix

  Fixed server base URL handling to ensure proper connection and routing in edge runtime environments, resolving issues with URL construction and path resolution.

  ### Inspector Enhancements

  Improved auto-connection logic with better error handling and retry mechanisms. Enhanced resource display components and OpenAI component renderer for better reliability and user experience. Updated connection context management for more robust multi-server support.

  ### Supabase Deployment Example

  Added complete Supabase deployment example with Deno-compatible server implementation, deployment scripts, and configuration templates to `create-mcp-use-app` for easier edge runtime deployment.

  ### React Hook and CLI Improvements

  Enhanced `useMcp` hook with better error handling and connection state management for browser-based MCP clients. Updated CLI with improved server URL handling and connection management.

- ceed51b: Standardize code formatting with ESLint + Prettier integration
  - Add Prettier for consistent code formatting across the monorepo
  - Integrate Prettier with ESLint via `eslint-config-prettier` to prevent conflicts
  - Configure pre-commit hooks with `lint-staged` to auto-format staged files
  - Add Prettier format checks to CI pipeline
  - Remove `@antfu/eslint-config` in favor of unified root ESLint configuration
  - Enforce semicolons and consistent code style with `.prettierrc.json`
  - Exclude markdown and JSON files from formatting via `.prettierignore`

- ceed51b: Several major updates:
  - `useMCP` now uses `BrowserMCPClient` (previously it relied on the unofficial SDK).
  - Chat functionality works in the Inspector using client-side message handling (LangChain agents run client-side, not in `useMcp` due to browser compatibility limitations).
  - Chat and Inspector tabs share the same connection.
  - The agent in Chat now has memory (previously, it didn't retain context from the ongoing conversation).
  - The client now uses the advertised capability array from the server to determine which functions to call.
    Previously, it would call functions like `list_resource` regardless of whether the server supported them.
  - Added PostHog integration in the docs.
  - Improved error handling throughout the Chat tab and connection process.
  - Fixed Apps SDK widget rendering with proper parameter passing.
