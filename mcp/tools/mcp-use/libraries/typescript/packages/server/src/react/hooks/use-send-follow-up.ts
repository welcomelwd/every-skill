/**
 * Returns a callback that sends a follow-up message to the conversation,
 * triggering a model turn.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Requires the host `message` capability; otherwise the returned promise
 * rejects before any wire traffic. The prompt is delivered to the host as a
 * user-authored chat message, as if the user had typed it. The returned
 * promise resolves when the host accepts the message — not when the model
 * responds; any response arrives through the normal conversation flow (and, if
 * the model calls this view's tool again, through {@link useToolContext}).
 * Hosts may require user confirmation or decline the message entirely.
 *
 * The returned callback is referentially stable for the lifetime of the
 * mounted runtime.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * function AskAgain() {
 *   const sendFollowUp = useSendFollowUp();
 *   return (
 *     <button
 *       type="button"
 *       onClick={() => sendFollowUp({ prompt: "Show more results" })}
 *     >
 *       Refine search
 *     </button>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
