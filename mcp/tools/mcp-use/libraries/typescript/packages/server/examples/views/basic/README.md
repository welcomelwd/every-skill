# Views example (Fruit Store)

Reference MCP Apps views server for `mcp-use`: view-bound tools, view
components under `views/`, typed tool I/O via exported tool refs, and
the full React runtime surface (`useToolContext`, `useCallTool`, `useViewTool`,
and the per-action hooks).

## What this demonstrates

- **File-based views** under `views/<name>/view.tsx`, discovered by
  `mcp-use dev` / `build` / `start`.
- **One tool ↔ one view** via `view: { name, description, prefersBorder, … }` on
  `search-fruits`, with output typed from the tool's `outputSchema`. Resource
  facts (description, CSP, permissions, domain, prefersBorder) are declared on
  that binder's `view:` config. A second tool cannot bind the same view —
  use a separate view resource, or call helpers from the view with
  `useCallTool`. Tool `visibility` is a top-level tool field, not inside
  `view:`.
- **Default `viewConfig`** — this view exports no `viewConfig`, so the runtime
  defaults apply (`autoResize: true`, display modes `inline` / `fullscreen` /
  `pip`).
- **Explicit presentation composition** — the default export wraps content in
  `ThemeProvider` and `ViewControls` directly (there is no `McpUseProvider`).
- **Zero-codegen typing** via `mcp-env.d.ts` and exported tool refs
  (`searchFruits`, `getFruitDetails`).
- **Capability gating** — `search-fruits` returns a markdown table fallback when
  the client does not advertise MCP Apps support.
- **Hook-first data flow** — the default export takes no props; tool output
  arrives via `useToolContext<"search-fruits">()` once `status === "ready"`.
- **Tool-error handling** — `status === "error"` exposes `ToolError`;
  `useCallTool` rejects tool errors while preserving its previous successful
  data.
- **`useViewTool` without an opt-in flag** — `highlight-fruit` registers when
  mounted and is removed on unmount.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — styling is the project's own declaration via
  `vite.config.ts` (`@tailwindcss/vite`) and `@import "tailwindcss"` in each
  view's `view.css`. The CLI's client build picks up the project Vite config
  automatically.

## Run locally

From this directory:

```sh
pnpm install   # once, from the monorepo root or here
pnpm dev
```

`mcp-use dev` serves MCP at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp`. Preview the view
through the built-in inspector (linked in the dev server log): open the
`ui://views/product-search-result.html` resource via `resources/read`.

Production path:

```sh
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

## Typing (`mcp-env.d.ts`)

View bundles never import server code. Types cross in type-space only:

```ts
// mcp-env.d.ts
import "mcp-use/vite-client";

declare module "mcp-use/react" {
  interface Register {
    tools: typeof import("./index.js");
  }
}

export {};
```

Export tool refs from `src/index.ts` (`export const searchFruits = …`,
`export const getFruitDetails = …`). Then `useToolContext<"search-fruits">()`,
`useCallTool("get-fruit-details")`, and related hooks infer input/output types
from those refs.

The `Register` declaration derives the mapping from those exported refs.

## Result channels

View-bound tool handlers return a plain `CallToolResult` (prefer raw; deprecated helpers only shape the same envelope):

1. **`structuredContent`** — model-visible and view-visible structured payload,
   typed by the bound tool's `outputSchema`. In the view it surfaces as
   `toolOutput` when `status === "ready"` (ready requires a non-error result
   with `structuredContent`).
2. **`content`** — model/text-host narrative blocks; also surfaced to the view.
3. **`_meta`** — view-only channel (never model context). The handler passes it
   directly on the returned object; the framework auto-stamps
   `_meta.ui.resourceUri` on every non-error view-bound tool result. There is
   no custom tool-name metadata — each view has one bound tool.

While waiting for a result, branch on `view.status`:

- `"pending"` — no terminal result yet; partial and complete arguments replace
  the same `DeepPartial` `view.toolInput`, which can drive the skeleton.
- `"error"` — the rendering invocation returned `isError: true`; `ToolError`
  exposes its message and `toolOutput` is undefined.
- `"ready"` — render from `view.toolOutput` (and optionally `view.content`,
  `view.meta`).

The first structured result or tool error is latched. Content-only ambient
results are valid and ignored; later lifecycle notifications cannot replace
the initial View context. Host environment comes from `useHostContext()` /
`useViewTheme()`; actions from `useCallTool`, `useSendFollowUp()`,
`useOpenExternal()`, and `useDisplayMode()`.

## Definition metadata versus result metadata

`_meta` on a tool definition is advertised by `tools/list`; `_meta` returned by
its callback belongs only to that invocation. They are not copied into one
another. Use vendor-namespaced keys for custom definition metadata:

```ts
export const searchFruits = server.tool(
  {
    name: "search-fruits",
    _meta: { "fruit.example/catalog-version": 3 },
    view: { name: "product-search-result" },
    outputSchema: resultsSchema,
  },
  async () => ({
    content: [{ type: "text", text: "Found fruits" }],
    structuredContent: { query: "", items: [] },
    _meta: { "fruit.example/request-cache": "hit" },
  })
);
```

The same distinction applies to resources: `annotations` and `_meta` on a
resource or resource-template definition appear in `resources/list` or
`resources/templates/list`; metadata for `resources/read` is authored on each
returned `contents[]` entry. General resource annotations use the exported
`Annotations` type, while tools use `ToolAnnotations`. For view-bound tools,
the framework derives `ui.resourceUri`, `ui.visibility`, and the legacy flat
`ui/resourceUri`; those keys follow the declared `view`/`visibility` fields on
collision, while unrelated custom keys are preserved.

## Images and CSP

Static files in the project-root `public/` folder are served under
`${basePath}/_mcp-use/public/` (e.g. `/fruits/apple.webp` in a view resolves to
`http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp/_mcp-use/public/fruits/apple.webp`). Use the
`<Image>` component for root-relative paths — the
synthesized view document injects the request-resolved public base so URLs stay
absolute inside `srcdoc` iframes (which have no document base URL).

For other public files, use `getPublicBaseUrl()` and append a path without a
leading slash. The returned URL always has a trailing slash:

```tsx
import { getPublicBaseUrl } from "mcp-use/react";

const publicBaseUrl = getPublicBaseUrl();
const stylesheetUrl = `${publicBaseUrl}assets/vendor.css`;
const wasmUrl = `${publicBaseUrl}wasm/module.wasm`;
```

This example keeps fruit WebP images in `public/fruits/` and references them as
`<Image src={`/fruits/${id}.webp`} …>`. Same-origin public assets are
automatically covered by the framework's serving-origin CSP entry on view
resources. This example does not declare `view.csp` because it has no external
image or fetch domains. To load assets from another origin, add
`view.csp.resourceDomains` (and `connectDomains` for API calls) on the
bound tool's `view:` config.

Imported assets (Vite `import url from "./file.png"`) are an alternative for
view-local files; production resolves them via `import.meta.url`, and dev
requires the Vite `server.origin` setting so emitted URLs are absolute.

## Tools

| Tool | View | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search-fruits` | `product-search-result` | Search catalog; renders the view when the client supports MCP Apps |
| `get-fruit-details` | — | Called from the view via `useCallTool` for detail cards |

The product-search view also registers `highlight-fruit` via `useViewTool`
(model-initiated UI affordance while the view is mounted).

## Typecheck

```sh
pnpm typecheck
```

Requires a built `mcp-use` (`pnpm build` in `packages/server`) so
`dist/react/index.d.ts` resolves.
