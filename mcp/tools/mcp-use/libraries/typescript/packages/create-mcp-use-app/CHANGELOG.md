## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 33e30cb: Drop the stale `main` field from the scaffolded package.json and give each template its own description.

  `main` still pointed at `dist/index.js`, which v2 never produces since builds now go to `.mcp-use/build`. The templates are applications started with `mcp-use start` rather than importable packages, so the field is removed instead of repointed at a gitignored build directory.

  All three templates also shared the description "an mcp-use server", which made `--list-templates` useless for telling them apart and put the same string in every generated project.

  Scaffolding also stopped discarding those descriptions. `updatePackageJson` overwrote `description` with a generic `"<name>: an mcp-use server"` on every run, so a generated project never kept the description of the template it came from. It now only fills that in when the template has no description of its own.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- a9ba017: Migrate the client stack to the official MCP TypeScript SDK v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.2`).
  - `@mcp-use/client` now depends on `@modelcontextprotocol/client` instead of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Both `@mcp-use/client` and `@mcp-use/agent` are ESM-only (Node 22.22.2+); CommonJS `require()` entry points and builds are no longer published. All connectors, sessions, OAuth, and the React `useMcp` hook were ported to the v2 API surface (method-string handlers, `SdkHttpError`/`SdkError`, `OAuthError`, `Headers`, `client/stdio` subpath).
  - Automatic protocol negotiation: HTTP connections default to `versionNegotiation: "auto"` (probe with `server/discover`, transparently falling back to the 2025 `initialize` handshake against v1 servers); stdio defaults to the SDK's v1 mode. The negotiated generation/version is exposed on the connection and `useMcp` result as `protocolEra: "legacy" | "modern"` and `protocolVersion`.
  - OAuth: consolidated `OAuthError`, issuer-stamp round-tripping, `discoveryState()` / `saveDiscoveryState()`, and `iss` validation on the callback (SEP-2352 / RFC 9207).
  - The root `@mcp-use/client` export now selects a browser-safe HTTP implementation outside Node and a Node-enabled implementation under Node. `@mcp-use/client/browser`, `@mcp-use/client/auth`, and `@mcp-use/client/auth/node` were removed; use the root `MCPClient`, `createOAuthProvider`, and React entry instead.
  - Breaking: the Node root entry no longer re-exports `BrowserOAuthClientProvider`, `BrowserOAuthOptions`, or `onMcpAuthorization` (those pull browser/`localStorage` code into the Node graph). Import them from `@mcp-use/client` in a browser bundler (default export condition) or from `@mcp-use/client/react` for the callback helper.
  - `MCPClient.connect()` / `createSession()` auto-provisions OAuth for HTTP servers (via the entry’s `createOAuthProvider`) when no bearer/`authProvider` is set, completes the 401 → consent dance, and retries. Pass `oauth` options or `oauth: false` on the server config; `authProvider` remains an escape hatch. The CLI connect path uses this instead of hand-wiring `NodeOAuthClientProvider`.
  - Breaking: removed v1 aliases (`samplingCallback`, `elicitationCallback`, `auth_token`, `customHeaders`, `clientConfig`, `debug`, `BrowserTelemetry`, and `ResourceTemplate`). Use `onSampling`, `onElicitation`, `authToken`, `headers`, `clientInfo`, `logLevel`, `Telemetry`, and `ResourceTemplateType`.
  - Dependency slimming: removed `posthog-js` / `posthog-node` in favor of a `fetch`-only PostHog capture (no SDK), and dropped `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` (a single MIME-type constant was inlined). `@mcp-use/client` now has a single runtime dependency (`@modelcontextprotocol/client`).
  - The v2 packages use commit-pinned MCP SDK preview builds required by this beta; `@mcp-use/agent` no longer carries the unused v1 `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
  - Runtime verification now covers Node, Deno, browser, and React against real v1 and v2 servers. Browser fetch is explicitly bound, Deno logging does not require env permission, and `useMcp` reaches `ready` only after normalized metadata is populated.
  - Client examples now run against a four-server matrix (official SDK stateful v1/stateless v2 plus mcp-use v1/v2 servers with MCP Apps) and cover notifications, roots, sampling, elicitation, completion, capability negotiation, OAuth, and rendered widgets. HTTP/stdio config now forwards initial roots, SDK client options, default request options, and HTTP connection timeouts to connectors.
  - Fixed legacy Streamable HTTP reverse RPC and notifications: streaming responses are no longer consumed by request logging, and sampling/elicitation use the active request transport. The v2 client auto-opens list-change subscriptions and preserves progress across MRTR retry rounds.
  - `McpClientProvider` now propagates negotiated v1/v2 metadata, auth state, resource templates, and reverse-request queues consistently. Its configured display label is now `displayName`; `name` remains the negotiated server identity.
  - React connections are HTTP-only, reconnect automatically, suppress console logging, and wait for explicit OAuth authentication by default. `clientOptions.capabilities.views: true` advertises MCP Apps support without hand-writing extension capabilities.
  - OAuth and transport proxies now preserve the upstream MCP URL as the SDK resource identity. Removed metadata/resource rewrite shims and gateway-derived OAuth URLs; MCP and OAuth bytes use separate injected fetch adapters.
  - Browser OAuth supports CIMD through `clientMetadataUrl`, keeps DCR as SDK-managed compatibility fallback, stores credentials per authorization-server issuer, and rejects browser client secrets.
  - The Inspector OAuth BFF now binds requests to SDK-discovered metadata/endpoints, fails closed on SSRF/private targets and redirects, caps bodies/timeouts, strips unsafe headers, and restricts CORS origins.
  - Breaking: `@mcp-use/client` and `@mcp-use/agent` are ESM-only. Use ESM `import` or dynamic `import()` from a CommonJS host; direct `require()` is unsupported. The client no longer re-exports Zod `*Schema` constants (use `isSpecType` / `specTypeSchemas`). The exported `telFetch` is now a plain non-throwing `fetch` wrapper `(url, init) => Promise<void>` (previously a PostHog `fetch` override). Removed the vendored `JSONSchemaToZod` helper — use Zod 4's native `z.fromJSONSchema()` instead.
  - The inspector and CLI were updated to consume the v2 client; the CLI gains a `--negotiate` flag on `client connect`. The CLI binary is now ESM (`dist/index.js`) since `@mcp-use/client` is ESM-only (`npx mcp-use` is unaffected).
  - Internal `@mcp-use/client` src layout reorganized into semantic folders (`transport/`, flat root client API, `code-mode/`, slim `auth/`, collapsed `react/`); public package exports (`.` and `./react`) and symbol names are unchanged.

### Minor Changes

- 3aca19c: Prefer Bun over Yarn in the scaffold CLI and docs, and make production source maps opt-in.

  **mcp-use**
  - Add `--source-maps` so `mcp-use build` emits source maps only when requested (server and view bundles default to no maps).
  - Widen `NextConfigLike` with an index signature so `withMcpUse` accepts arbitrary Next.js config fields.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Replace `--yarn` with `--bun`, detect Bun from the user agent, and install/run with Bun when selected.

  **@mcp-use/agent / @mcp-use/client**
  - Point missing-optional-dependency errors at npm, pnpm, or Bun instead of Yarn.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Drop Yarn-specific install/lint scripts from the package scripts surface.

- d9c2023: Rename the `starter` scaffold to `mcp-server` (example tool + prompt only; resource example removed). The `starter` template id remains as a deprecated alias.
- 192d193: Require `useCallTool("name")` names to resolve to exported server `ToolRef`
  values once `mcp-env.d.ts` registers the server entry. Add
  `useDynamicTool<Args, Result>("name")` as the explicit escape hatch for tools
  registered from runtime data, loops, or OpenAPI documents.

  Add `mcp-use typecheck`, which refreshes the managed `mcp-env.d.ts` entry
  bridge and then invokes the project's local TypeScript compiler with
  `--noEmit`. New projects scaffold the declaration and use this command in
  their `typecheck` script.

- f259641: Align view authoring layout, typing shims, and local dev host behavior across the v2 stack.

  **mcp-use**
  - Move file-based view sources from `resources/` to `views/` (wire exposure stays MCP resources).
  - Replace root `tools.d.ts` with `mcp-env.d.ts`, adding CSS module typing plus the live `Register` import shim; dev/build create it exclusively when absent.
  - Simplify favicon selection to the first icon (or explicit `favicon` config).
  - Auto-respawn the dev tunnel on disconnect with exponential backoff and subdomain fallback.

  **@mcp-use/client**
  - Add `mockOpenAiFileApis` on `ViewRenderer` and export `injectOpenAiFileApis` so `useFiles()` works in inspector and other local hosts.
  - Advertise host `message` capability by default.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Enable `mockOpenAiFileApis` in view preview and standalone host props.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Refresh starter, blank, and MCP Apps scaffolds for `views/`, `mcp-env.d.ts`, webp demo assets, and the expanded product-search carousel template.

### Patch Changes

- 34a5c81: Refine the MCP Apps starter display modes by removing its picture-in-picture exit control and moving the mcp-use badge to the top in fullscreen.

  Show a centered, CSS-only `Compiling...` indicator while a view's entry module loads, and remove it before rendering the app.

- 116eda9: Align the scaffold CLI checks and documentation with the bundled Inspector. Generated projects rely solely on `mcp-use` for the CLI and built-in Inspector; users no longer need to add `@mcp-use/inspector` themselves.
- 50df3a1: Replace `--canary` with `--sdk-version <version>` so new projects can pin `mcp-use` to any npm dist-tag or semver (e.g. `canary`, `1.34.3-canary.0`). Use `--sdk-version canary` where `--canary` was used before.
- afdd5e8: Fix all bundled beta templates for the current TypeScript and MCP Apps view-state APIs.
- f3187f9: Resolve the current `mcp-use` beta dist-tag when scaffolding a project so generated package manifests no longer pin a stale beta version.
- eedeb4f: Restore complete Inspector relay support for MCP transport and OAuth discovery, registration, and token exchange. Keep confidential dynamic-client secrets in the server-side BFF, recover stale per-server browser OAuth and connection storage safely, isolate callback exchange from background reconnects, and tolerate unsupported optional inventory methods.

  Improve Inspector diagnostics and connection-list behavior with inline error details, a localhost recovery command for hosted callback rejections, newest-first servers, bottom scroll spacing, reliable favicon loading, and versioned revalidated standalone assets.

  Make the Inspector project-pinned local development tooling. Generated projects install `@mcp-use/inspector` as a dev dependency, and `mcp-use dev` dynamically calls its framework-neutral `mountInspector()` on the existing listener. The installed package now owns the only MCP/OAuth proxy and serves its `dist/app` browser bundle locally with no remote application fallback; production handlers no longer expose an Inspector shell or duplicate proxy implementation.

- a3edf35: Provide Vite client types through `mcp-use` so generated projects can import CSS, SVG, and other supported assets without maintaining custom declarations or depending directly on Vite.
- b47e268: Raise the Node.js engine floor from `>=20.19.0` to `>=22.13.0` across published packages, scaffolds, examples, CI, Docker, and esbuild/tsup build targets. Use `@types/node` `^22.13.0`. Required for pnpm 11.13 in GitHub Actions and unblocks the beta release workflow.
- 1579839: Raise the Node.js engine floor to `>=22.22.2` (post–March 2026 security release) and pin CI to Node 22.23.1 so trusted npm 12 publishing works.
- c1c6c2b: Publish the optimized standalone Inspector and CLI packaging: ordinary mcp-use installs avoid the Inspector UI dependency graph, while Inspector, client tooling, and production opt-ins remain available on demand.
- 18e9eb6: Pin beta scaffolds to `mcp-use@2.0.0-beta.36` by default while preserving `--dev` and explicit `--sdk-version` overrides.
- 34405ca: Resolve the default SDK and bundled MCP Apps skill from the matching release channel: beta builds use npm `beta` and the beta branch, while stable builds use npm `latest` and the main branch.
- 50df3a1: Refresh scaffold and example dependency pins: TypeScript `^7.0.2` (stable, replaces `7.0.1-rc`) and React `^19.2.7`.
- a26bac6: Install the native v2 MCP Apps skill from the matching release branch, use the standard `.agents/skills` project directory for Codex, resolve stable scaffolds from npm's `latest` tag, and normalize stable internal peer ranges.
- fe4d3b2: Enable MCP view JS code splitting and polish inspector boot UX.

  **mcp-use**
  - Enable rolldown code splitting for per-view client builds (`chunkFileNames` alongside the entry chunk) for external assets and split chunks.
  - Paint a centered boot spinner in the managed inspector shell while the CDN bundle downloads.

  **@mcp-use/inspector**
  - Match the boot spinner placeholder in the CDN inspector shell.
  - Add top margin to tool error banners in the result panel.

  **create-mcp-use-app**
  - Fix scaffold README inspector links to `${basePath}/inspector` (`/mcp/inspector` by default).
  - Align the mcp-apps `mcp-env.d.ts` template comment with the auto-generated shim.

## 0.14.17

### Patch Changes

- 430178c: feat(server): enforce `outputSchema` at the tool return position, and make templates score 100% on the publishing checklist (MCP-2260)
  - `mcp-use`: a tool's `outputSchema` is now type-checked at the return position with no new API. Returning `object({...})` (or `widget({ props })`, whose props become the result's `structuredContent`) with a shape that does not match `outputSchema` is a compile-time error, while content-only helpers (`text()`, `markdown()`, `image()`, ...) are always allowed. This is achieved by typing content helpers as a new `ToolContentResult` (no `structuredContent`) and making `widget()` generic over its props. Note: returning `mix()` carrying structured content, or a raw object literal whose `structuredContent` does not match, against a tool that declares `outputSchema` now errors (use `object()` or align the shape).
  - `mcp-use`: the Apps SDK adapter auto-derives `openai/widgetDescription` from the widget's `description` when it isn't set explicitly, so hosts (and the publishing checklist) always see a widget description.
  - `create-mcp-use-app` (`starter`): `fetch-weather` declares a `title` and an `outputSchema`, returning matching `structuredContent` via `object()`.
  - `create-mcp-use-app` (`mcp-apps`): `search-tools` and `get-fruit-details` declare a `title`, and the `product-search-result` widget declares a `domain` (widget description is auto-derived from its `description`).

## 0.14.17-canary.0

### Patch Changes

- 84e9c7d: feat(server): enforce `outputSchema` at the tool return position, and make templates score 100% on the publishing checklist (MCP-2260)
  - `mcp-use`: a tool's `outputSchema` is now type-checked at the return position with no new API. Returning `object({...})` (or `widget({ props })`, whose props become the result's `structuredContent`) with a shape that does not match `outputSchema` is a compile-time error, while content-only helpers (`text()`, `markdown()`, `image()`, ...) are always allowed. This is achieved by typing content helpers as a new `ToolContentResult` (no `structuredContent`) and making `widget()` generic over its props. Note: returning `mix()` carrying structured content, or a raw object literal whose `structuredContent` does not match, against a tool that declares `outputSchema` now errors (use `object()` or align the shape).
  - `mcp-use`: the Apps SDK adapter auto-derives `openai/widgetDescription` from the widget's `description` when it isn't set explicitly, so hosts (and the publishing checklist) always see a widget description.
  - `create-mcp-use-app` (`starter`): `fetch-weather` declares a `title` and an `outputSchema`, returning matching `structuredContent` via `object()`.

## 0.14.12

### Patch Changes

- 46caf80: Remove unused dependencies and devDependencies flagged by `knip`.
  - Root: drop `lint-staged` and `typescript-eslint` (unused; ESLint config uses `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` directly, and Husky pre-commit runs `pnpm format`/`lint:fix` directly without lint-staged). Removed the stale root `lint-staged` config block.
  - `@mcp-use/cli`: drop `globby`, `ws`, `@types/ws` (no source references; `globby` was explicitly replaced by Node built-ins). Removed `globby` from `tsup.config.ts` `noExternal`.
  - `create-mcp-use-app`: drop `fs-extra` and `@types/fs-extra` (no source references).
  - `mcp-use`: drop `ws`, `@types/ws`, `@antfu/eslint-config`, `@langchain/anthropic` (devDep — already an optional peer; only referenced as a string for dynamic import), `eslint-plugin-format`, `lint-staged`. Removed the stale package-level `lint-staged` config block.
  - `knip.json`: ignore `@mcp-use/inspector` for the `cli` package (resolved dynamically via `createRequire().resolve` to read its `package.json`).

  `pnpm knip:deps` now reports 0 unused (dev)dependencies. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm lint`, and `pnpm build` all succeed.

- 46caf80: Make `mcp-use/server` response helpers discoverable to humans and coding agents.
  - **`MCPServer.tool()` JSDoc**: each `@example` block now includes the matching `import { ... } from "mcp-use/server"` line, plus a note that helpers (`text`, `object`, `image`, `markdown`, `html`, `error`, `widget`, …) are exported from `mcp-use/server`. Previously the examples called `text(...)` / `error(...)` with no import, so anyone reading the hover doc had no breadcrumb to the package.
  - **`create-mcp-use-app` blank template**: the commented tool/resource/prompt blocks previously called `text(...)`, `object(...)`, and `z.object(...)` without showing where any of those came from — and the file's top-level imports never referenced them either. Each commented block now includes the relevant `import { ... } from "mcp-use/server"` / `import { z } from "zod"` lines inside the comment, alongside a leading note naming the available response helpers. The template stays truly blank (no tools registered) but the discovery path is now local to the file.

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { LangChainAdapter } from "mcp-use";

  // After
  import { LangChainAdapter } from "mcp-use/adapters";
  ```

  **Note:** `@langchain/core` and `langchain` moved from dependencies to optional peer dependencies.

  ### WebSocket Transport Removed

  WebSocket transport support has been removed. Use streamable HTTP or SSE transports instead.

  **Learn more:** [Client Configuration](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/client/client-configuration)

  ## Features

  ### Session Management Architecture with Redis Support

  Implements a pluggable session management architecture enabling distributed deployments with cross-server notifications, sampling, and resource subscriptions.

  **New Interfaces:**
  - `SessionStore` - Pluggable interface for storing session metadata
    - `InMemorySessionStore` (production default)
    - `FileSystemSessionStore` (dev mode default)
    - `RedisSessionStore` (distributed deployments)
  - `StreamManager` - Manages active SSE connections
    - `InMemoryStreamManager` (default)
    - `RedisStreamManager` (distributed via Redis Pub/Sub)

  **Server Configuration:**

  ```typescript
  // Development (default - FileSystemSessionStore for hot reload)
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "dev-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
  });

  // Production distributed (cross-server notifications)
  import { RedisSessionStore, RedisStreamManager } from "mcp-use/server";
  const server = new MCPServer({
    name: "prod-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    sessionStore: new RedisSessionStore({ client: redis }),
    streamManager: new RedisStreamManager({
      client: redis,
      pubSubClient: pubSubRedis,
    }),
  });
  ```

  **Client Improvements:**
  - Auto-refresh tools/resources/prompts when receiving list change notifications
  - Manual refresh methods: `refreshTools()`, `refreshResources()`, `refreshPrompts()`, `refreshAll()`
  - Automatic 404 handling and re-initialization per MCP spec

  **Convenience Methods:**
  - `sendToolsListChanged()` - Notify clients when tools list changes
  - `sendResourcesListChanged()` - Notify clients when resources list changes
  - `sendPromptsListChanged()` - Notify clients when prompts list changes

  **Development Experience:**
  - FileSystemSessionStore persists sessions to `.mcp-use/sessions.json` in dev mode
  - Sessions survive server hot reloads
  - Auto-cleanup of expired sessions (>24 hours)

  **Deprecated:**
  - `autoCreateSessionOnInvalidId` - Now follows MCP spec strictly (returns 404 for invalid sessions)

  **Learn more:** [Session Management](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/server/session-management)

  ### Favicon Support for Widgets

  Added favicon configuration for widget pages:

  ```typescript
  const server = createMCPServer({
    name: "my-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
    favicon: "favicon.ico", // Path relative to public/ directory
  });
  ```

  - Favicon automatically served at `/favicon.ico` for entire server domain
  - CLI build process includes favicon in widget HTML pages
  - Long-term caching (1 year) for favicon assets

### Minor Changes

- 26e1162: Migrated mcp-use server from Express to Hono framework to enable edge runtime support (Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Supabase Edge Functions). Added runtime detection for Deno/Node.js environments, Connect middleware adapter for compatibility, and `getHandler()` method for edge deployment. Updated dependencies: added `hono` and `@hono/node-server`, moved `connect` and `node-mocks-http` to optional dependencies, removed `express` and `cors` from peer dependencies.

  Added Supabase deployment documentation and example templates to create-mcp-use-app for easier edge runtime deployment.

- 26e1162: ### MCPAgent Message Detection Improvements (fix #446)

  Fixed issue where `agent.run()` returned "No output generated" even when valid output was produced, caused by messages not being AIMessage instances after serialization/deserialization across module boundaries. Added robust message detection helpers (`_isAIMessageLike`, `_isHumanMessageLike`, `_isToolMessageLike`) that handle multiple message formats (class instances, plain objects with `type`/`role` properties, objects with `getType()` methods) to support version mismatches and different LangChain message formats. Includes comprehensive test coverage for message detection edge cases.

  ### Server Base URL Fix

  Fixed server base URL handling to ensure proper connection and routing in edge runtime environments, resolving issues with URL construction and path resolution.

  ### Inspector Enhancements

  Improved auto-connection logic with better error handling and retry mechanisms. Enhanced resource display components and OpenAI component renderer for better reliability and user experience. Updated connection context management for more robust multi-server support.

  ### Supabase Deployment Example

  Added complete Supabase deployment example with Deno-compatible server implementation, deployment scripts, and configuration templates to `create-mcp-use-app` for easier edge runtime deployment.

  ### React Hook and CLI Improvements

  Enhanced `useMcp` hook with better error handling and connection state management for browser-based MCP clients. Updated CLI with improved server URL handling and connection management.

### Patch Changes

- 26e1162: Fixed canary flag not properly replacing package versions when using published templates. The `--canary` flag now correctly replaces both `workspace:*` patterns (in local development) and caret versions (in published packages) with `"canary"` versions of `mcp-use`, `@mcp-use/cli`, and `@mcp-use/inspector`.
