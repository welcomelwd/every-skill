/**
 * Canvas group (`nodeGroups`) helpers.
 *
 * n8n 2.28+ stores canvas groups on the workflow as
 * `nodeGroups: [{ id, name, nodeIds, description? }]`. Groups are presentational, but n8n
 * validates them on every write: when a PUT omits `nodeGroups`, the server backfills the STORED
 * groups and validates them against the submitted nodes/connections. A workflow whose group has
 * lost a member, or whose members are no longer a single connected run, is rejected with HTTP 400 —
 * so an edit that has nothing to do with grouping fails.
 *
 * This module keeps two responsibilities strictly apart:
 *
 * 1. **Repair** — only changes that are safe on every n8n version: drop per-group keys the API's
 *    `additionalProperties: false` group schema rejects, prune node IDs that no longer exist, and
 *    drop groups left with no members.
 *
 * 2. **Error classification** — n8n's own rejection messages name the offending group, so topology
 *    is adjudicated by the server rather than re-implemented here. Reimplementing it would pin us
 *    to one n8n minor: the shared validator combines an all-connection-type connectivity search
 *    with main-only entry/exit extraction and node-type metadata for trigger detection, and those
 *    rules change between releases. A local copy that disagreed with the server would silently
 *    delete groups the server would have accepted.
