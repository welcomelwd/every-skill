/**
 * n8n Version Detection and Version-Aware Settings Filtering
 *
 * This module provides version detection for n8n instances and filters
 * workflow settings based on what the target n8n version supports.
 *
 * Which property arrived in which version lives in constants/workflow-settings.ts, together
 * with the pass-through floor at or above which settings are forwarded untouched.
 *
 * References:
 * - https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/21297 (PR adding 4 new properties in 1.119.0)

 * carries no version field; only a browser session gets the full settings. We authenticate with a
 * Public API key, so the version is never in the response. The Public API itself exposes no
 * version anywhere, so there is no route to switch to.
 *
 * Callers must treat null as "unknown", never as "old" - and new behaviour should be gated on
 * what the API actually answers, not on a version number. A probe that reaches the instance and
 * finds no version is cached like a successful one, so the request happens at most once per TTL
