# Advanced MCP Security with Azure Content Safety

> **OWASP MCP Risk Addressed**: [MCP06 - Intent Flow Subversion](https://microsoft.github.io/mcp-azure-security-guide/mcp/mcp06-prompt-injection/)

Azure Content Safety provides several powerful tools that can enhance the security of your MCP implementations. For hands-on implementation experience, see [MCP Security Summit Workshop (Sherpa)](https://azure-samples.github.io/sherpa/) Camp 3: I/O Security.

## Prompt Shields

Microsoft's AI Prompt Shields provide robust protection against both direct and indirect prompt injection attacks through:

1. **Advanced Detection**: Uses machine learning to identify malicious instructions embedded in content.
2. **Spotlighting**: Transforms input text to help AI systems distinguish between valid instructions and external inputs.
3. **Delimiters and Datamarking**: Marks boundaries between trusted and untrusted data.
4. **Content Safety Integration**: Works with Azure AI Content Safety to detect jailbreak attempts and harmful content.
5. **Continuous Updates**: Microsoft regularly updates protection mechanisms against emerging threats.

## Implementing Azure Content Safety with MCP

This approach provides multi-layered protection:
- Scanning inputs before processing
- Validating outputs before returning
- Using blocklists for known harmful patterns
- Leveraging Azure's continuously updated content safety models
