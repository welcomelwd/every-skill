### New Lesson: The 2026-07-28 MCP Specification Release Candidate

Added coverage of the upcoming `2026-07-28` MCP specification release candidate (announced May 21, 2026; final release scheduled July 28, 2026), summarized from the [official announcement blog post](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-07-28-release-candidate/). The curriculum's baseline remains **MCP Specification 2025-11-25** until the new version ships, so this is presented as forward-looking guidance rather than a rewrite of existing lessons.

- **New**: [01-CoreConcepts/mcp-2026-07-28-release-candidate.md](./01-CoreConcepts/mcp-2026-07-28-release-candidate.md) — a full lesson covering the stateless protocol core (removal of the `initialize` handshake and `Mcp-Session-Id`), the new `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name` routing headers, `ttlMs`/`cacheScope` caching metadata, W3C Trace Context in `_meta`, the formal Extensions framework (MCP Apps and the new Tasks extension), six authorization-hardening SEPs, the deprecation of Roots/Sampling/Logging, and the move to full JSON Schema 2020-12 for tool schemas.
- **Updated** with forward-looking callouts linking to the new lesson:
  - [01-CoreConcepts/README.md](./01-CoreConcepts/README.md): protocol version note, Sampling/Roots/Logging/Tasks sections, and "What's next"
  - [02-Security/README.md](./02-Security/README.md): authorization hardening callout

### MCP Specification Alignment & Sample Validation

Validated the curriculum against the current **MCP Specification 2025-11-25** and the latest official SDKs, then corrected the remaining stale specification references and confirmed the core samples still build and run.

#### Specification Version Corrections (2025-06-18 / 2025-03-26 → 2025-11-25)

Updated English content where it still claimed an older spec revision was the *current/latest* standard, and repointed links to the canonical `modelcontextprotocol.io` spec paths:
- **05-AdvancedTopics/mcp-security/README.md**: Updated the "Current Standard" banner, introduction, core security principles heading, mandatory requirements heading, Microsoft Entra ID section, References & Resources links, and closing security notice (8 references) to 2025-11-25
- **05-AdvancedTopics/mcp-transport/README.md**: Updated the Additional Resources spec link and the "Current Standard" banner to 2025-11-25
- **05-AdvancedTopics/mcp-realtimesearch/README.md**: Replaced the outdated `2025-03-26` security-and-trust link with the current 2025-11-25 security best practices page
- **03-GettingStarted/14-sampling/README.md**: Updated the official sampling docs link to 2025-11-25
- **03-GettingStarted/05-stdio-server/README.md**: Updated the present-tense "current MCP specification" reference and the Additional Resources spec link to 2025-11-25 (historical SSE-deprecation notes left intact for accuracy)

#### Sample Validation Against Current SDKs

- **TypeScript (03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/solution/typescript)**: `npm install` resolved `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.29.0`; `tsc --noEmit` passed with no type errors — existing `McpServer`/`StdioServerTransport` APIs remain valid
- **Python (03-GettingStarted/01-first-server/solution/python)**: Validated in an isolated `.venv` with `mcp[cli]` (1.27.2); `py_compile` passed and `FastMCP.list_tools()` correctly returned the `add` and `subtract` tools
- Confirmed all sample `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` version ranges (`>=1.26.0` / `^1.26.0` / `^1.27.0`) resolve cleanly to the current `1.29.0` with no breaking API changes

#### Dependency Pin Alignment (closing version gaps)

Bumped outdated SDK pins so every sample tracks the current MCP release, matching the repo-wide convention:
- **03-GettingStarted/05-stdio-server/solution/typescript/package.json**: Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from `^1.8.0` → `>=1.26.0` and updated the stale `"updated for MCP 2025-06-18"` package description to `"aligned with MCP Specification 2025-11-25"`
- **10-StreamliningAIWorkflows.../lab3/code/weather_mcp/pyproject.toml** and **lab4/code/github_mcp_server/pyproject.toml**: Bumped the exact pin `mcp==1.23.0` → `mcp>=1.26.0`; regenerated both `uv.lock` files (`uv lock`) so the lockfiles resolve to the current `mcp 1.27.2` and stay in sync with the manifests

#### Curriculum Gap Analysis — Latest Spec Feature Coverage

Verified the curriculum already covers all primitives introduced/expanded in MCP 2025-11-25, so no content gaps remain:
- **Sampling**: Lesson 03-GettingStarted/14-sampling plus 05-AdvancedTopics/mcp-sampling
- **Elicitation (incl. URL mode)**: Documented in 01-CoreConcepts and 05-AdvancedTopics/mcp-protocol-features
- **Roots**: Documented in 00-Introduction, 01-CoreConcepts, and 05-AdvancedTopics/mcp-root-contexts
- **Tasks (experimental, long-running operations)**: Documented in 01-CoreConcepts and 05-AdvancedTopics/mcp-protocol-features
- **Tool Annotations** (`readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint`): Documented in 01-CoreConcepts and 05-AdvancedTopics/mcp-protocol-features

### Security Hardening & Dependency Vulnerability Remediation

Ran a full security pass across every dependency manifest and the sample source code, then remediated all reported npm advisories and one code-level finding. After remediation, `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities** in every audited directory.

#### npm Dependency Vulnerabilities (transitive) — Fixed

Audited all 15 committed `package-lock.json` files. Vulnerabilities were limited to transitive dependencies pulled in by the MCP Inspector dev tool, the OpenAI client, and the MCP SDK; all are now resolved without breaking the samples:
- **10-StreamliningAIWorkflows.../lab4/code/github_mcp_server/inspector** and **lab3/code/weather_mcp/inspector**: Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` (`0.16.6` / `0.14.1` → `0.22.0`), which cleared the bundled `ajv`, `brace-expansion`, `diff`, `path-to-regexp` and `ws` advisories. Added an npm `overrides` entry forcing the patched `shell-quote@1.8.4` to eliminate the remaining critical advisory carried by `concurrently`; regenerated both lockfiles (now 0 vulnerabilities)
- **03-GettingStarted/samples/typescript**: `npm audit fix` updated the transitive `qs` (moderate) to a patched release
- **03-GettingStarted/samples/javascript**: `npm audit fix` updated the transitive `hono` (moderate) to a patched release
- **03-GettingStarted/03-llm-client/solution/typescript**: `npm audit fix` updated the transitive `form-data` (high) to a patched release
- **03-GettingStarted/11-simple-auth/solution/typescript**: Generated the missing `package-lock.json` so the project is reproducible and auditable (0 vulnerabilities)

#### Code-Level Security Fix (OWASP A03: Injection)

- **10-StreamliningAIWorkflows.../lab4/code/github_mcp_server/src/server.py**: Removed `shell=True` from the `open_in_vscode` tool. The previous `subprocess.run(["start", "", vscode_path, folder_path], shell=True)` allowed shell metacharacters in a folder path to be interpreted by `cmd.exe` (command-injection vector). It now launches the resolved `Code.exe` directly with the folder as an argument — no shell — which is functionally equivalent and safe

#### Python Dependency Audit

- Audited every Python requirements set with `pip-audit`. `05-AdvancedTopics` and `03-GettingStarted/samples/python` reported **no known vulnerabilities** (their `mcp` / `httpx` / `pydantic` / `python-dotenv` ranges resolve to current patched releases)
- **09-CaseStudy/docs-mcp/solution/python/requirements.txt**: `pip-audit` flagged the transitive dependency **`werkzeug` 3.1.1** with three `safe_join` Windows device-name DoS advisories — `CVE-2025-66221`, `CVE-2026-21860`, and `CVE-2026-27199` (all fixed in 3.1.6). Added an explicit security pin `werkzeug>=3.1.6` so the patched release is resolved; verified the constraint resolves cleanly with the `chainlit` / `mcp` / `semantic-kernel` stack
