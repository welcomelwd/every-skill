# Implementing Azure Content Safety with MCP

> **OWASP MCP Risk Addressed**: [MCP06 - Intent Flow Subversion](https://microsoft.github.io/mcp-azure-security-guide/mcp/mcp06-prompt-injection/)

To strengthen MCP security against prompt injection, tool poisoning, and other AI-specific vulnerabilities, integrating Azure Content Safety is highly recommended. This implementation guide aligns with the [MCP Security Summit Workshop (Sherpa)](https://azure-samples.github.io/sherpa/) Camp 3: I/O Security.

## Integration with MCP Server

To integrate Azure Content Safety with your MCP server, add the content safety filter as middleware in your request processing pipeline:

1. Initialize the filter during server startup
2. Validate all incoming tool requests before processing
3. Check all outgoing responses before returning them to clients
4. Log and alert on safety violations
5. Implement appropriate error handling for failed content safety checks

This provides a robust defense against:
- Prompt injection attacks
- Tool poisoning attempts
- Data exfiltration via malicious inputs
- Generation of harmful content

## Best Practices for Azure Content Safety Integration

1. **Custom Blocklists**: Create custom blocklists specifically for MCP injection patterns
2. **Severity Tuning**: Adjust severity thresholds based on your specific use case and risk tolerance
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Apply content safety checks to all inputs and outputs
4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider implementing caching for repeated content safety checks
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Define clear fallback behaviors when content safety services are unavailable
6. **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback to users when content is blocked due to safety concerns
7. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update blocklists and patterns based on emerging threats
