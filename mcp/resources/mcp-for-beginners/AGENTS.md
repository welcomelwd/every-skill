```bash
cd <project-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install -e .
python main.py
```

#### Java Projects
```bash
cd <project-directory>
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Development Workflow

### MCP 7-28 Readiness

#### Repo readiness checklist

- [x] **New contributor clarity**: This file defines repository purpose,
  structure, contribution rules, and sample setup paths.
- [x] **Build/test/lint commands with exact flags**:
  - Repository docs lint:
    `npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "#node_modules" "#translations" "#translated_images"`
  - Repository docs link pattern audit:
    `find . -name "*.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "./translations/*" -not -path "./translated_images/*" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -En "\[.*\]\(.*\)"`
  - TypeScript sample validation:
    `cd 03-GettingStarted/samples/typescript && npm ci && npm test && npm run build`
  - Python sample validation:
    `cd 10-StreamliningAIWorkflowsBuildingAnMCPServerWithAIToolkit/lab3/code/weather_mcp && python -m pip install -e . && pytest -q`
  - Java sample validation:
    `cd 03-GettingStarted/samples/java/calculator && mvn -B -ntp test verify`
- [x] **One realistic workflow that can become an MCP tool**:
  `validate_curriculum_change`
- [x] **Inputs/outputs are explicit** (see specification below).
- [x] **Permissions and failure modes are documented** (see specification below).
- [x] **CI testability is explicit** (deterministic commands, explicit
  exit codes, and machine-readable outputs).

#### Candidate MCP tool workflow: `validate_curriculum_change`

##### Goal

Validate curriculum documentation changes and representative sample code
health before merge.

##### Inputs

- `changed_paths: string[]` (required) - relative paths changed in PR.
- `run_docs_lint: boolean` (default `true`)
- `run_links_audit: boolean` (default `true`)
- `run_samples: { typescript?: boolean, python?: boolean, java?: boolean }`
  (default all `false`)

##### Outputs

- `status: "ok" | "failed"`
- `checks: Array<{ name: string, command: string, exit_code: number,
  summary: string }>`
- `artifacts: Array<{ type: "log" | "report", path: string }>`
- `failed_checks: string[]`

##### Permissions

- Read workspace files and write tool-generated artifacts (e.g., lint
  reports, test logs) only; no writes to `translations/` or
  `translated_images/`.
- Execute local shell commands.
- Optional network access only for package restore (`npm ci`,
  `python -m pip install`, `mvn` dependency resolution).
- No permission to push, merge, or modify `translations/` or
  `translated_images/`.

##### Failure modes

- `E_NO_INPUT_PATHS`: `changed_paths` empty.
- `E_INVALID_PATH`: input path escapes repository root.
- `E_LINT_FAILED`: markdown lint exits non-zero.
- `E_LINK_AUDIT_FAILED`: link audit command exits non-zero.
- `E_SAMPLE_TEST_FAILED`: sample test/build exits non-zero.
- `E_TIMEOUT`: command exceeded configured timeout.

##### Recommended CI contract

To automate validation, configure a CI job that:

- Triggers on pull requests touching `*.md`, sample code, or this file.
- Runs the exact commands listed above.
- Persists logs as artifacts.
- Fails the job on any non-zero exit code.

### Documentation Structure

- **Modules 00-11**: Core curriculum content in sequential order
- **translations/**: Language-specific versions (auto-generated, do not edit directly)
- **translated_images/**: Localized image versions (auto-generated)
- **images/**: Source images and diagrams

### Making Documentation Changes

1. Edit only the English markdown files in the root module directories (00-11)
2. Update images in the `images/` directory if needed
3. The co-op-translator GitHub Action will automatically generate translations
4. Translations are regenerated on push to main branch

### Working with Translations

- **Automated Translation**: GitHub Actions workflow handles all translations
- **Do NOT manually edit** files in `translations/` directory
- Translation metadata is embedded in each translated file
- Supported languages: 48+ languages including Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and many more

## Testing Instructions

### Documentation Validation

Since this is primarily a documentation repository, testing focuses on:

1. **Link Pattern Audit**: List Markdown links for review

   ```bash
   # List Markdown links (pattern audit)
   find . -name "*.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "./translations/*" -not -path "./translated_images/*" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -En "\[.*\]\(.*\)"
   ```

2. **Code Sample Validation**: Test that code examples compile/run

   ```bash
   # Navigate to specific sample and run its tests
   cd 03-GettingStarted/samples/typescript
   npm install && npm test
   ```

3. **Markdown Linting**: Check formatting consistency

   ```bash
   # Use markdownlint if needed
   npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md" "#node_modules" "#translations" "#translated_images"
   ```

### Sample Project Testing

Each language-specific sample includes its own testing approach:

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

#### Python
```bash
pytest
python -m pytest tests/
```

#### Java
```bash
mvn test
mvn verify
```

### Common Troubleshooting

**Q: My PR is failing the translation check**
A: Ensure you only edited English markdown files in the root module directories, not translated versions.

**Q: How do I add a new language?**
A: Language support is managed through the co-op-translator workflow. Open an issue to discuss adding new languages.

**Q: Code samples aren't working**
A: Ensure you've followed the setup instructions in the specific sample's README. Check that you have the correct versions of dependencies installed.

**Q: Images aren't displaying**
A: Verify image paths are relative and use forward slashes. Images should be in the `images/` directory or `translated_images/` for localized versions.

### Performance Considerations

- Translation workflow may take several minutes to complete
- Large images should be optimized before committing
- Keep individual markdown files focused and reasonably sized
- Use relative links for better portability
