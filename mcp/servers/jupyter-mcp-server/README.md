#### JupyterLab Integration

*Available only when JupyterLab mode is enabled. It is enabled by default.*

When running in JupyterLab mode, Jupyter MCP Server integrates with [jupyter-mcp-tools](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-mcp-tools) to expose additional JupyterLab commands as MCP tools. By default, the following tools are enabled:

| Name                         | Description                                            |
| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `notebook_run-all-cells`     | Execute all cells in the current notebook sequentially |
| `notebook_get-selected-cell` | Get information about the currently selected cell      |

<details>
<summary><strong>📚 Learn how to customize additional tools</strong></summary>

You can now customize which tools from `jupyter-mcp-tools` are available using the `allowed_jupyter_mcp_tools` configuration parameter. This allows you to enable additional notebook operations, console commands, file management tools, and more.

```bash
# Example: Enable additional tools via command-line
jupyter lab --port 4040 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --JupyterMCPServerExtensionApp.allowed_jupyter_mcp_tools="notebook_run-all-cells,notebook_get-selected-cell,notebook_append-execute,console_create"
```

For the complete list of available tools and detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the [Additional Tools documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/features/tools-jupyterlab).

</details>

### 📝 Prompt Overview

The server also supports [prompt feature](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) of MCP, providing a easy way for user to interact with Jupyter notebooks.

| Name           | Description                                                                 |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jupyter-cite` | Cite specific cells from specified notebook (like `@` in Coding IDE or CLI) |

For more details on each prompt, their input parameters, and return content, please refer to the [official Prompt documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/features/prompts).

## 🏁 Getting Started

For comprehensive setup instructions—including `Streamable HTTP` transport, running as a Jupyter Server extension and advanced configuration—check out [our documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech). Or, get started quickly with `JupyterLab` and `STDIO` transport here below.

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
pip install jupyterlab jupyter-collaboration jupyter-mcp-tools ipykernel
```

> [!TIP]
> To confirm your environment is correctly configured:
>
> 1. Open a notebook in JupyterLab
> 1. Type some content in any cell (code or markdown)
> 1. Observe the tab indicator: you should see an "×" appear next to the notebook name, indicating unsaved changes
> 1. Wait a few seconds—the "×" should automatically change to a "●" without manually saving
>
> This automatic saving behavior confirms that the real-time collaboration features are working properly, which is essential for MCP server integration.

### 2. Start JupyterLab

```bash
# Start JupyterLab on port 8888, allowing access from any IP and setting a token
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running notebooks through JupyterHub instead of JupyterLab as above, refer to our [JupyterHub setup guide](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/code-sandboxes/jupyterhub).

### 3. Configure Your Preferred MCP Client

Next, configure your MCP client to connect to the server. We offer two primary methods—choose the one that best fits your needs:

- **📦 Using `uvx` (Recommended for Quick Start):** A lightweight and fast method using `uv`. Ideal for local development and first-time users.
- **🐳 Using `Docker` (Recommended for Production):** A containerized approach that ensures a consistent and isolated environment, perfect for production or complex setups.

<details>
<summary><b>📦 Using uvx (Quick Start)</b></summary>

First, install `uv`:

```bash
pip install uv
uv --version
# should be 0.6.14 or higher
```

See more details on [uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then, configure your client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["jupyter-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "JUPYTER_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "JUPYTER_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐳 Using Docker (Production)</b></summary>

**On macOS and Windows:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "JUPYTER_URL",
        "-e", "JUPYTER_TOKEN",
        "-e", "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "JUPYTER_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:8888",
        "JUPYTER_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**On Linux:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-e", "JUPYTER_URL",
        "-e", "JUPYTER_TOKEN",
        "-e", "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT",
        "--network=host",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "JUPYTER_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "JUPYTER_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

> [!TIP]
>
> 1. **Port Configuration**: Ensure the `port` in your Jupyter URLs matches the one used in the `jupyter lab` command. For simplified config, set this in `JUPYTER_URL`.
> 1. **Server Separation**: Use `JUPYTER_URL` when both services are on the same server, or set individual variables for advanced deployments. The different URL variables exist because some deployments separate notebook storage (`DOCUMENT_URL`) from kernel execution (`CODE_SANDBOX_URL`).
> 1. **Authentication**: In most cases, document and code sandbox services use the same authentication token. Use `JUPYTER_TOKEN` for simplified config or set `DOCUMENT_TOKEN` and `CODE_SANDBOX_TOKEN` individually for different credentials.
> 1. **Notebook Path**: The `DOCUMENT_ID` parameter specifies the path to the notebook the MCP client default to connect. It should be relative to the directory where JupyterLab was started. If you omit `DOCUMENT_ID`, the MCP client can automatically list all available notebooks on the Jupyter server, allowing you to select one interactively via your prompts.
> 1. **Image Output**: Set `ALLOW_IMG_OUTPUT` to `false` if your LLM does not support mutimodel understanding.

## 🧩 Sandbox Variants

By default, code executes through the `code-sandboxes` `jupyter` variant against
a Jupyter Server (`SANDBOX_VARIANT=jupyter`). Setting `SANDBOX_VARIANT` to any
other value uses another [code-sandboxes](https://github.com/datalayer/code-sandboxes)
engine via the sandbox's plain kernel client when the selected variant exposes
one, so the same notebook tools can run code on additional backends.

Sandbox features are provided by the optional `jupyter_mcp_sandboxes` extension.
To expose sandbox lifecycle tools (`launch_sandbox`, `list_sandboxes`,

### 1. Jupyter Server

The default engine. Point the server at a running Jupyter Server:

```bash
pip install jupyter-mcp-server
```

```json
"env": {
  "JUPYTER_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
  "JUPYTER_TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN"
}
```

### 2. JupyterHub

JupyterHub uses the same `jupyter` engine, targeting a user's single-user server.
Authenticate with a JupyterHub API token that has the `access:servers` scope:

```json
"env": {
  "CODE_SANDBOX_URL": "https://your-jupyterhub.domain/user/<username>",
  "CODE_SANDBOX_TOKEN": "your-jupyterhub-api-token",
  "DOCUMENT_URL": "https://your-jupyterhub.domain/user/<username>",
  "DOCUMENT_TOKEN": "your-jupyterhub-api-token"
}
```

See the [JupyterHub setup guide](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/code-sandboxes/jupyterhub) for full details.

### 3. Datalayer

Execute on the [Datalayer](https://datalayer.ai) cloud code sandbox with GPU support
and persistence:

```bash
pip install "jupyter-mcp-server[datalayer]"
```

```json
"env": {
  "SANDBOX_VARIANT": "datalayer",
  "CODE_SANDBOX_URL": "https://prod1.datalayer.run",
  "CODE_SANDBOX_TOKEN": "your-datalayer-token",
  "SANDBOX_ENVIRONMENT": "python-cpu-env"
}
```

### 4. Kaggle

Execute against Kaggle. By default, when no code sandbox URL/channels are provided,
the server uses the transparent Kaggle **batch** path from `code-sandboxes`.
If code sandbox values are provided, it uses Kaggle interactive kernel mode.

```bash
pip install "jupyter-mcp-server[kaggle]"
```

```json
"env": {
  "SANDBOX_VARIANT": "kaggle",
  "KAGGLE_API_TOKEN": "...",
  "SANDBOX_GPU": "T4"
}
```

To force interactive code sandbox mode, provide `CODE_SANDBOX_URL` and either:

- `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` / `CODE_SANDBOX_TOKEN` (create kernel), or
- `CODE_SANDBOX_ID` / `CODE_SANDBOX_CHANNELS_URL` (connect existing kernel).

Supported Kaggle accelerator values include:
`NvidiaTeslaP100`, `NvidiaTeslaT4`, `NvidiaTeslaT4Highmem`, `NvidiaL4`,
`NvidiaL4X1`, `NvidiaTeslaA100`, `NvidiaH100`, and `NvidiaRtxPro6000`.
Aliases such as `P100` and `T4` are accepted.

> Note: Kaggle free-tier availability usually includes `P100` and `T4`. Other
> accelerators are commonly restricted to specific competitions or internal
> Kaggle workloads.

### 5. Google Colab

Execute against a Google Colab code sandbox. Install Jupyter MCP Server and provide the
values from an active Colab notebook session:

```bash
pip install jupyter-mcp-server
```

```json
"env": {
  "SANDBOX_VARIANT": "google-colab",
  "CODE_SANDBOX_URL": "https://8080-m-s-kkb-...-d.us-east1-0.prod.colab.dev",
  "CODE_SANDBOX_ID": "a1b2c3d4-....",
  "CODE_SANDBOX_PROXY_TOKEN": "ya29...."
}
```

> The proxy token (`colab-runtime-proxy-token`) is short-lived; refresh it when it
> expires.

You can also pass `CODE_SANDBOX_CHANNELS_URL` with the Colab channels WebSocket URL
and let the server derive `CODE_SANDBOX_URL` and `CODE_SANDBOX_ID`.

### 6. Monty

Execute in [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty), a secure in-process Python
interpreter — ideal for short, safe LLM snippets. No credentials required.

```bash
pip install "jupyter-mcp-server[monty]"
```

```json
"env": {
  "SANDBOX_VARIANT": "monty"
}
```

> Monty supports only a subset of Python; third-party libraries and rich display
> outputs are not available.

### 7. Modal

Execute in a [Modal](https://modal.com/docs/guide) cloud sandbox. Install the
extra and configure Modal credentials:

```bash
pip install "jupyter-mcp-server[modal]"
modal token new
```

For local development, `modal token new` is usually enough because the Modal SDK
loads credentials from `~/.modal.toml`.

If you run in CI/CD, containers, or hosted runners, set both environment
variables below.

```json
"env": {
  "SANDBOX_VARIANT": "modal",
  "MODAL_TOKEN_ID": "ak-...",
  "MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET": "as-..."
}
```

Why both variables? Modal uses a token pair for environment-based auth:

- `MODAL_TOKEN_ID`: public token identifier.
- `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`: secret half paired with that id.

Providing only one is insufficient for authentication.

If needed, export both values from your local Modal config:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import pathlib
import tomllib

cfg = tomllib.loads(pathlib.Path("~/.modal.toml").expanduser().read_text())
profile = cfg.get("default", cfg)
token_id = profile.get("token_id")
token_secret = profile.get("token_secret")
if token_id and token_secret:
    print(f"export MODAL_TOKEN_ID={token_id}")
    print(f"export MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET={token_secret}")
else:
    raise SystemExit("Could not find token_id/token_secret in ~/.modal.toml")
PY
```

> You can also select the engine on the command line with
> `--sandbox-variant`, `--code-sandbox-proxy-token`, and `--sandbox-environment`.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Required environment variables for tests:

- None for the default local suite.

Optional environment variables:

- `TEST_MCP_SERVER`: `true`/`false` toggle for standalone MCP server mode tests (default `true`).
- `TEST_JUPYTER_SERVER`: `true`/`false` toggle for Jupyter extension mode tests (default `true`).
- `DATALAYER_API_KEY`: required only for Datalayer cloud smoke/integration tests.
- `DATALAYER_RUN_URL`: optional custom Datalayer code sandbox URL for datalayer engine tests.
- `SANDBOX_ENVIRONMENT`: optional cloud environment override (for example `ai-agents-env`).

## ✅ Best Practices

- Interact with LLMs that supports multimodal input (like Gemini 2.5 Pro) to fully utilize advanced multimodal understanding capabilities.
- Use a MCP client that supports returning image data and can parse it (like Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.), as some clients may not support this feature.
- Break down complex task (like the whole data science workflow) into multiple sub-tasks (like data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, etc.) and execute them step-by-step.
- Provide clearly structured prompts and rules (👉 Visit our [Prompt Templates](prompt/README.md) to get started)
- Provide as much context as possible (like already installed packages, field explanations for existing datasets, current working directory, detailed task requirements, etc.).
