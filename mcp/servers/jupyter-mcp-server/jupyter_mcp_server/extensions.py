"""Extension mechanism for Jupyter MCP Server.

Extensions are standalone Python packages that plug additional capabilities
into the server — extra MCP tools, alternative kernel factories, or custom
``execute_code`` routing — without the core needing to know about them.

Discovery and lifecycle are powered by :mod:`reactor`, a small
``pluggy``-based plugin platform. Each extension:

* is published on the ``jupyter_mcp_server.extensions`` entry-point group,
* subclasses :class:`JupyterMCPExtension`,
* is registered with a :class:`~reactor.PluginManifest` so the reactor
  platform can track versions, compatibility and lifecycle.

The first bundled extension is ``jupyter_mcp_sandboxes`` (see ``ext/sandboxes``),
which contributes the sandbox lifecycle tools and sandbox-backed execution.
