"""Regression test for _execute_via_notebook_manager releasing a borrowed
kernel connection while its background execution is still in flight.

asyncio.Task.cancel() on a task wrapping asyncio.to_thread() cannot stop the
underlying OS thread (see track_pending_execution / test_execute_code_orphaned_timeout.py).
On a timeout, _execute_on_kernel can return before that background thread has
actually finished. The finally block in _execute_via_notebook_manager must not
stop the borrowed sandbox client while that thread is still using it; doing so
pulls the transport out from under a call still in progress.
