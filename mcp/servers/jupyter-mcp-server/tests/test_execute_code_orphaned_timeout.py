"""Regression test for the timeout path in execute_code abandoning its
background execution.

asyncio.Task.cancel() on a task wrapping asyncio.to_thread() cannot stop the
underlying OS thread: kernel.execute(code) keeps running in the background
after a timeout has already been raised back to the caller.
_execute_on_kernel must record that task via track_pending_execution so
is_kernel_busy()/wait_for_kernel_idle() see the still-running execution,
the same way execute_cell_tool.py already does. Without it, a subsequent
execute_code/execute_cell call against the same kernel can start immediately
while the abandoned thread is still talking to the kernel.
