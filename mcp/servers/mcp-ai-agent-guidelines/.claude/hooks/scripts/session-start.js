/**
 * mcp-ai-agent-guidelines — SessionStart reminder hook
 *
 * Called by the Copilot / VS Code hook system at the beginning of every new
 * session.  Prints a reminder to stdout so the agent sees it and calls
 * `task-bootstrap` before starting work.
 *
 * Hook JSON snippet:
 *   "SessionStart": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node .agent/hooks/session-start.js" }]
 *
 * Or if mcp-cli is globally installed:
 *   "SessionStart": [{ "type": "command", "command": "mcp-ai-agent-guidelines hooks remind-session" }]
