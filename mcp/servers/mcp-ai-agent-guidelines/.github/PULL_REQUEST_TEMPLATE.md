## 🚦 PRE-FLIGHT VALIDATION (REQUIRED)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Complete this checklist **BEFORE** requesting agent review to avoid costly reruns ($0.10+ per rerun)

### Local Quality Gates (MUST PASS)

Run these commands locally and ensure they all pass:

- [ ] ✅ `npm run quality` (type-check + lint) - **MUST PASS**
- [ ] ✅ `npx lefthook run pre-commit` (security + formatting) - **MUST PASS**
- [ ] ✅ `npx lefthook run pre-push` (tests + validation) - **MUST PASS**
- [ ] ✅ `npm run test:all` (all tests) - **MUST PASS**

### Code Standards (VERIFY BEFORE COMMITTING)

- [ ] All imports use `.js` extensions (e.g., `from './foo.js'`)
- [ ] No `any` types used (use proper TypeScript types)
- [ ] All new code has tests (90% coverage required)
- [ ] Tests mirror `src/` structure in `tests/vitest/`
- [ ] Updated demos if tools modified (`node demos/demo-tools.js`)

### Why This Matters

**PRs that fail these checks will:**
- ❌ Fail CI/CD workflows
- ❌ Require agent reruns (costs money!)
- ❌ Delay merge time
- ❌ Create extra review cycles

**✅ Passing these checks means:**
- ✅ Fast CI/CD passes
- ✅ No wasted agent invocations
- ✅ Quick merge process
- ✅ Happy reviewers!
