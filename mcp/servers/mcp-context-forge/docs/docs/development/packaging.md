# Packaging & Distribution

This guide covers how to package ContextForge for deployment in various environments, including building production containers and generating releases.

---

## 📦 Production Container (Podman or Docker)

Build an OCI-compliant container image using:

```bash
make podman        # builds using Containerfile with Podman
# or manually
podman build -t mcpgateway:latest -f Containerfile .
```

Or with Docker (if Podman is not available):

```bash
make docker        # builds using Containerfile with Docker
# or manually
docker build -t mcpgateway:latest -f Containerfile .
```

`Containerfile` is the canonical multi-stage build (UBI builder → ubi-minimal
runtime) supporting amd64, arm64, s390x, and ppc64le, with optional Rust runtime
support (`--build-arg ENABLE_RUST=true`) and profiling tools
(`--build-arg ENABLE_PROFILING=true`).

---

## 🔐 Run with TLS (self-signed)

```bash
make podman-run-ssl
```

This uses self-signed certs from `./certs/` and runs HTTPS on port `4444`.

---

## 🛠 Container Run (HTTP)

```bash
make podman-run
```

This runs the container without TLS on port `4444`.

---

## 📝 Versioning

ContextForge uses semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and the version is defined in:

```python
mcpgateway/__init__.py
```

You can bump the version manually or automate it via Git tags or CI/CD.

---

## 📁 Release Artifacts

### Building PyPI Packages

The project uses a custom build hook (`build_hooks/__init__.py`) that automatically generates UI assets during packaging:

```bash
make dist
# or manually:
BUILD_UI_ASSETS=true python -m build
```

This automatically:

1. Cleans old bundle-*.js files
2. Runs `npm install` (if node_modules doesn't exist)
3. Runs `npm run vite:build` (generates bundle-*.js)
4. Runs `npm run build:css` (generates tailwind.min.css)
5. Builds wheel and sdist with assets included

**Prerequisites**: Node.js and npm must be installed.

**Note**: The `BUILD_UI_ASSETS=true` env var is required to trigger the npm build. Without it, the hook is skipped (preventing unintended `package-lock.json` mutations during `uv sync` or `pip install`).

**Output**: `dist/mcp_contextforge_gateway-{version}-py3-none-any.whl` and `.tar.gz`

**Note**: Built assets (bundle-*.js, tailwind.min.css) are NOT committed to git but ARE included in PyPI packages. Users installing from PyPI get pre-built assets without needing Node.js.

### Verify Assets

```bash
unzip -l dist/*.whl | grep -E "(bundle-|tailwind.min.css)"
```

Expected output:
```
mcpgateway/static/bundle-<hash>.js
mcpgateway/static/css/tailwind.min.css
```

### Distribution

Outputs land under `dist/`. You can then:

* Push to PyPI (internal or public)
* Upload to GitHub Releases
* Package in a `.deb`, `.rpm`, etc.

## 📂 What's in the Container?

A typical image includes:

* Gunicorn running with `mcpgateway.main:app`
* All code, static files, and compiled assets

> You can override settings using environment variables at runtime.
