# Building Locally

Follow these instructions to set up your development environment, build the gateway from source, and run it interactively.

---

## 🧩 Prerequisites

- Python **≥ 3.11**
- `make`
- (Optional) Docker or Podman for container builds

---

## 🔧 One-Liner Setup (Recommended)

```bash
make venv install-dev serve
```

This will:

1. Create a virtual environment in `.venv/`
2. Install Python dependencies (including dev extras)
3. Run the gateway using Gunicorn

---

## 🐍 Manual Python Setup

If you need to bypass the Makefile, use `uv` directly — the project's dev
dependency group is defined via PEP 735 (`[dependency-groups]`), so the
traditional `pip install -e ".[dev]"` form does not apply:

```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --group dev '.[plugins]'
```

This installs:

* Core app dependencies
* Dev dependencies (`pytest`, `coverage`, `mypy`, `bandit`, etc.)
* Plugin framework extras

Formatters and linters (`ruff`, `pylint`, `vulture`,
`interrogate`, `radon`, `yamllint`, `tomlcheck`) are **not** installed into the
venv — they are invoked on demand through the Makefile targets (`make ruff`,
`make pylint`, `make vulture`, `make interrogate`,
`make radon`, `make yamllint`, `make tomllint`), which fetch pinned versions
via `uv tool run`.

---

## 🚀 Running the App

You can run the gateway with:

```bash
make serve         # production-mode (Gunicorn) on http://localhost:4444
make dev           # hot-reload (Uvicorn) on http://localhost:8000
make run           # executes ./run.sh with your current .env settings
RELOAD=true make run   # enable auto-reload via run.sh (same as ./run.sh --reload)
./run.sh --help    # view all supported flags
```

Use `make dev` during development for auto-reload on port 8000.

---

## 🔄 Live Reload Tips

When relying on `run.sh`, set `RELOAD=true` (or pass `--reload`) and `DEV_MODE=true` in your `.env` so settings match.

Also set:

```env
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

---

## 🧪 Test It

```bash
curl http://localhost:4444/health
curl http://localhost:4444/tools
```

You should see `[]` or registered tools (once added).

## 🎨 Frontend Tooling

The Admin UI uses plain JavaScript (not TypeScript). Frontend tooling requires Node.js:

```bash
npm install        # install frontend dev dependencies
```

### Building the Admin UI Bundle

The Admin UI JavaScript is bundled with Vite. The bundle is **not committed** to the repository — it must be built locally. `make install-dev` invokes `make build-ui` automatically, and the step is required: without a bundle, `/admin` will fail to load at runtime with `No bundle-*.js found`. Rebuild after any changes to files under `mcpgateway/admin_ui/`.

**Node.js is a prerequisite.** If `npm` is missing, `make build-ui` (and therefore `make install-dev`) fails fast rather than leaving a broken install. Install Node.js from <https://nodejs.org> before running setup.

```bash
make build-ui          # build mcpgateway/static/bundle-<hash>.js (requires npm)
```

If you genuinely do not need the Admin UI (for example, a headless API-only deployment where `MCPGATEWAY_UI_ENABLED=false`), bypass the step with:

```bash
SKIP_UI_BUILD=1 make install-dev
```

Or build manually:

```bash
npm ci                 # install dependencies from lockfile (falls back to `npm install` if lockfile absent)
npm run vite:build     # produce mcpgateway/static/bundle-<hash>.js
```

The server reads `mcpgateway/static/.vite/manifest.json` at startup to locate the hashed bundle filename.

For iterative development you can use watch mode:

```bash
npx vite build --watch
```

### Linting & Formatting

```bash
make eslint        # lint JavaScript with ESLint
make lint-web      # ESLint + HTMLHint + Stylelint
make format-web    # format with Prettier
```

### Frontend Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ESLint | JavaScript linting (neostandard + prettier) |
| Prettier | Code formatting |
| Stylelint | CSS linting |
| HTMLHint | HTML linting |
| Biome | Fast JS/TS formatter/linter |
| Retire.js | Dependency vulnerability scanning |

### UI Testing

```bash
# Playwright (UI automation)
playwright install              # one-time browser setup
pytest tests/playwright/        # run UI tests

# Locust (load testing)
locust -f tests/loadtest/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:4444
```

Note: JavaScript unit tests are not yet implemented. Testing efforts focus on the Python backend (pytest) and UI automation (Playwright).

### Air-Gapped Mode (Local Development)

The Admin UI bundle is built locally via npm/Vite, and vendor JavaScript is installed from npm and bundled/chunked with Vite. To test the UI in air-gapped mode:

```bash
MCPGATEWAY_UI_AIRGAPPED=true make dev
```

This serves the Admin UI without requiring external asset fetches. See [Admin UI - Air-Gapped Mode](../overview/ui.md#air-gapped-mode) for details.
