## 1. Version Update

### 1.1 Bump the version

Use `bump2version` to update all version references atomically:

```bash
bump2version --verbose --new-version=X.Y.Z-RC-N build
```

This updates the version string in the canonical locations defined in `.bumpversion.cfg`:


!!! note "bump2version does not commit or tag"
    The project's `.bumpversion.cfg` has `commit = False` and `tag = False`. You must commit and tag manually after all gates pass.

### 1.2 Check for stale version references

Search the codebase for any remaining references to the **old** version and update them. Exclude files where the old version appears in a historical context:

- `CHANGELOG.md` (historical entries are expected)
- `docs/docs/architecture/roadmap.md` (closed milestones are expected)
- Git history

Common places to check:

- `charts/mcp-stack/Chart.yaml` (`appVersion`)
- `charts/mcp-stack/values.yaml` (image tag)
- `docs/docs/index.md` or overview pages
- `README.md` badge or installation snippets

### 1.3 Update `CHANGELOG.md`

Update `CHANGELOG.md` following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:

- Add a new section header: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD - Release Title`
- Include an **Overview** paragraph describing the release focus
- Document **Breaking Changes** with migration tables (old default vs. new default)
- Organize entries under standard headings: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`
- Link each entry to its GitHub issue or PR where applicable

### 1.4 Update `docs/docs/architecture/roadmap.md`

- Set the release's **Completion** to `100%` and **Status** to `Closed`
- Verify the **Due Date** matches the actual release date
- Move any incomplete issues from this milestone to the next release

### 1.5 Resolve GitHub security advisories

Review and resolve all items on the [Security tab](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/security):

- **Dependabot alerts** — upgrade or dismiss every open alert. No critical or high severity alerts may remain open at release time.
- **Code scanning alerts** — review any CodeQL or third-party SAST findings and resolve or justify each one.
- **Secret scanning alerts** — verify no leaked secrets are flagged; rotate any that were exposed.

```bash
# Quick check via CLI
gh api repos/IBM/mcp-context-forge/dependabot/alerts --jq '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | length'
gh api repos/IBM/mcp-context-forge/code-scanning/alerts --jq '[.[] | select(.state=="open")] | length'
```

**Acceptance criteria:** Zero open critical/high Dependabot alerts. All code scanning and secret scanning alerts reviewed and resolved or triaged with documented justification.

### 1.6 Update container base images

Update the `FROM` lines in `Containerfile` to the latest available tags. Pinned image tags prevent silent drift but must be bumped manually before each release.

Check current base images:

```bash
grep '^FROM' Containerfile
```

| Stage | Current image | What to check |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Rust builder | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi10/ubi:<tag>` | [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi10/ubi) |
| Frontend builder | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi10/nodejs-24:<tag>` | [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi10/nodejs-24) |
| Builder | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi10/ubi:<tag>` | [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi10/ubi) |
| Runtime | `registry.access.redhat.com/ubi10/ubi-minimal:<tag>` | [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi10/ubi-minimal) |

Update `Containerfile` with the latest tags, then verify the image builds:

```bash
make docker-prod DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--no-cache"
```

## 2. Python Dependency Updates

Update all Python dependencies across the repository before cutting a release. This ensures the release ships with current, patched versions.

### 2.1 Update CPEX dependencies

Update the `[tool.uv.sources]` / `[tool.uv.exclude-newer-package]` section of the root `pyproject.toml` to the current date/time, then run:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade
```

### 2.2 Update all `pyproject.toml` lockfiles and `requirements.txt` files

The snippet below auto-discovers every `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` in the repository, skipping generated templates and virtual-environment directories. No hardcoded path list means newly added or deleted sub-projects are picked up automatically.

```bash
# uv-sync + lockfile upgrade for every pyproject.toml
# Skips: mcp-servers/templates (generated), .venv dirs, Rust crates (no uv)
find . \
  -path "./mcp-servers/templates" -prune -o \
  -path "*/.venv" -prune -o \
  -path "*/target" -prune -o \
  -path "./.cache" -prune -o \
  -name "pyproject.toml" -type f -print \
| while read -r toml_file; do
    dir=$(dirname "$toml_file")
    echo "==> $dir"
    uv-upsync --project "$dir" 2>/dev/null || true
    uv lock --upgrade --exclude-newer "10 days" --project "$dir"
  done

# requirements.txt files (docs, tests)
find . \
  -path "*/.venv" -prune -o \
  -path "./.cache" -prune -o \
  -name "requirements.txt" -type f -print \
| while read -r req_file; do
    echo "==> $req_file"
    python .github/tools/update_dependencies.py --file "$req_file"
  done
```

!!! tip "Dry-run the requirements updater first"
    Use `--dry-run` to preview changes before applying:
    ```bash
    python .github/tools/update_dependencies.py --file docs/requirements.txt --dry-run
    ```

### 2.3 Reinstall and verify

After updating, reinstall the dev environment and verify everything still resolves:

```bash
make install-dev
```

### 2.4 Audit for vulnerabilities

```bash
make pip-audit
```

**Acceptance criteria:** No known CVEs in the resolved dependency tree. If `pip-audit` reports vulnerabilities, evaluate whether a fix is available or whether the dependency must be pinned with a documented justification.

### 2.4 Rebuild and test

Verify the containers build with the updated dependencies and the test suite passes:

```bash
make docker-prod DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--no-cache"
make test
```

---

## 3. Rust & JavaScript Dependency Updates

Update non-Python dependencies across the repository.

### 3.1 Rust dependencies

Update the root workspace `Cargo.lock` and verify the workspace builds and passes tests:

```bash
cargo update --workspace

# Verify build + lint + tests
make rust-check
```

| What it runs | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `cargo fmt --check` | Verify Rust formatting |
| `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | Lint for common mistakes and anti-patterns |
| `cargo test --lib --release` | Run Rust unit tests |

### 3.2 Rust supply-chain vetting

After any Rust dependency update, run cargo-vet before release freeze:

```bash
make rust-vet
```

The `make rust-vet` target runs `cargo vet check` against `supply-chain/config.toml`, `supply-chain/audits.toml`, and the trusted audit imports recorded in `supply-chain/imports.lock`. Release CI treats this as a blocking gate for Rust wheels and source distributions.

If vetting fails, use the [cargo-vet audit workflow](https://mozilla.github.io/cargo-vet/performing-audits.html) to handle each unvetted crate before tagging:

| Option | When to use it | What to do |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Use an imported audit | A trusted upstream audit set already covers the crate/version | Review the suggested import, then update `supply-chain/config.toml` and `supply-chain/imports.lock` if the trust relationship is acceptable |
| Audit the diff | Cargo-vet suggests a small `cargo vet diff <crate> <old> <new>` | Review the exact version diff, then record it with `cargo vet certify <crate> <old> <new>` |
| Audit the crate fully | The crate is new, or the diff is not a useful review unit | Inspect the exact crate source with `cargo vet inspect <crate> <version>`, then record it with `cargo vet certify <crate> <version>` |
| Add a temporary exemption | The update is needed now, but a full audit is not practical before release | Add the narrowest `[[exemptions.<crate>]]` entry in `supply-chain/config.toml` with the required criteria, and document why it is acceptable |
| Skip or revert the update | The audit cost or risk is too high for the release window | Keep the currently vetted version and move the dependency update to a follow-up task |

Audits and exemptions should be reviewed by Rust maintainers or security reviewers who understand the affected crate and the `safe-to-deploy` / `safe-to-run` criteria. Prefer diff audits over exemptions. Exemptions are allowed, but each one reduces the value of the vetting gate and should be revisited with `cargo vet suggest`.

When ContextForge and `cpex-plugins` share Rust dependency changes, apply the same decision in both repositories: run each repo's cargo-vet check, update each repo's `supply-chain/` metadata, or explicitly defer the update in the repo where the audit cannot be completed.

At the end of Rust supply-chain vetting, prune stale cargo-vet exemptions:

```bash
cargo vet prune
```

### 3.3 JavaScript dependencies (npm)

Update `package.json` and verify the frontend builds and passes linting:

```bash
npm update
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

Then run the full web linting and test suite:

```bash
make lint-web
make test-js-coverage
```

### 3.4 Frontend CDN dependencies

The Admin UI installs vendor JavaScript through npm and bundles/chunks it with Vite. Release validation should therefore focus on npm dependency updates and verifying the generated bundle, not CDN-pinned assets.

| File | What it controls |
|------|------------------|
| `package.json` | Frontend dependency versions and scripts |
| `package-lock.json` | Locked npm dependency graph |
| `mcpgateway/admin_ui/` | Admin UI source bundled by Vite |

**Update procedure:**

1. **Check for new versions** of frontend dependencies in `package.json` and the lockfile.

2. **Update npm dependencies** and refresh the lockfile:

    ```bash
    npm update
    npm audit
    npm audit fix
    ```

3. **Rebuild the Admin UI bundle**:

    ```bash
    make build-ui
    ```

4. **Rebuild the container** to verify the frontend build path:

    ```bash
    make docker-prod DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--no-cache"
    ```

5. **Smoke test the Admin UI** to verify bundled assets load correctly in normal and air-gapped deployments.

!!! note "Bundled frontend assets"
    Admin UI vendor JavaScript is installed from npm and bundled/chunked with Vite. Keep `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and the Admin UI source in sync when updating frontend dependencies.

### 3.5 Rebuild containers

After updating all dependency ecosystems, rebuild the production container from scratch to verify everything integrates:

```bash
make docker-prod DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--no-cache"
```

---

## 4. Quality Gates

The steps below are the quality gates that require a human to run at release time. Formatting (`ruff-format`), import sorting, YAML/TOML/JSON syntax checks, and docstring coverage are all enforced by pre-commit hooks on every commit and are not repeated here. Python linters (`ruff`, `bandit`, `interrogate`, `pylint`), web linting, and config-file linting run in CI on every PR.

!!! note "Pre-commit hooks run automatically"
    `ruff-format`, `ruff-check`, `bandit`, `interrogate`, `detect-secrets`, `yamllint`, `check-yaml`, `check-toml`, and `check-json` all run as pre-commit hooks and in CI. They do not need a dedicated manual release step. `check-headers` also runs as a pre-commit hook but is not yet in CI — it remains a manual release step (§4.3) until a CI job is added.

### 4.1 Package metadata validation

```bash
make verify
```

Validates the wheel and sdist with twine, check-manifest, and pyroma. This is not yet wired into a CI job and must be run manually before tagging.

### 4.2 Secrets scanning

```bash
make detect-secrets-scan-all
```

Re-runs the full baseline scan across all tracked files against `.secrets.baseline`. (`make detect-secrets-scan` is the developer-facing variant: it scans only files changed vs `main`, merges results into the baseline while preserving audited entries for out-of-scope tracked files, and exits non-zero on any live, unaudited, or audited-as-real findings.) Whole-tree coverage is also enforced in CI by `make detect-secrets-hook` over `git ls-files` with `--fail-on-unaudited`, but a fresh full-tree scan immediately before tagging is the last line of defence.

**Acceptance criteria:** No unaudited secrets detected. Any false positives are triaged via `make detect-secrets-audit` and recorded in `.secrets.baseline`.

!!! warning "Run before tagging"
    Secrets in git history survive even after deletion from the working tree. Always run the secrets-scan gate before creating a release tag.

### 4.3 License header compliance

```bash
make check-headers
```

Verifies all Python files have correct Apache-2.0 license headers, copyright year, and SPDX identifier. This is a dry-run check — no files are modified.

**Acceptance criteria:** Zero files reported as missing or having incorrect headers. If any are found, fix them with `make fix-all-headers` before release.

---

## 5. Test Gates

### 5.1 Python unit tests with coverage

```bash
make coverage
```

Runs the full pytest suite with coverage reporting. Review coverage for any significant regressions.

### 5.2 JavaScript unit tests with coverage

```bash
make test-js-coverage
```

Runs Vitest with Istanbul coverage against frontend JavaScript.

### 5.3 UI tests (Playwright)

Requires the compose stack to be running (see [Build Verification](#6-build-verification)).

```bash
make test-ui-headless
```

Runs the full Playwright test suite in headless Chromium against the live compose stack.

### 5.4 MCP protocol tests

Requires the compose stack to be running with SSE transport enabled.

```bash
make test-mcp-rbac test-mcp-protocol-e2e
```

| Target | What it tests |
|--------|---------------|
| `test-mcp-rbac` | RBAC enforcement and multi-transport MCP protocol compliance |
| `test-mcp-protocol-e2e` | MCP protocol via FastMCP client against the gateway |

### 5.5 Load testing

Requires the compose stack with the testing profile (includes Locust).

```bash
make load-test-cli
```

**Acceptance criteria:** 10-minute sustained run, 1000 RPS target, **0% error rate**.

The load test defaults are configured via Makefile variables (`LOADTEST_HOST`, `LOADTEST_USERS`, `LOADTEST_SPAWN_RATE`, `LOADTEST_RUN_TIME`, `LOADTEST_PROCESSES`). For release validation, ensure the test runs for a sufficient duration with realistic concurrency.

!!! tip "System tuning"
    For accurate load test results, run `sudo scripts/tune-loadtest.sh` to optimize kernel parameters before testing.

Additional load profiles are available for targeted validation:

```bash
make load-test-light      # Quick smoke: 10 users, 30s
make load-test-heavy      # Stress: 200 users, 120s
make load-test-sustained  # Endurance: 25 users, 300s
make load-test-stress     # Peak: 500 users, 60s
```

---

## 6. Build Verification

### 6.1 Production container build

Build the production image from scratch to verify there are no build regressions:

```bash
make docker-prod DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--no-cache"
```

This builds the lite production image with Docker Content Trust enabled.

### 6.2 Compose stack validation

Bring up the full stack with the testing profile and verify all services are healthy:

```bash
make testing-down compose-clean testing-up
```

This starts the gateway along with Locust, A2A echo server, fast test server, and MCP Inspector. Verify all services are healthy:

```bash
make compose-ps
```

!!! warning "Run compose tests before tearing down"
    The UI tests, MCP tests, and load tests in [Section 5](#5-test-gates) require this stack to be running. Run all compose-dependent tests before calling `make compose-clean`.

### 6.3 Embedded mode verification

Verify the gateway works correctly in embedded/iframe mode with benchmark servers:

```bash
make embedded-up
```

This starts the embedded stack with:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| iframe Harness | `http://localhost:8889` | UI inside iframe |
| Gateway (nginx) | `http://localhost:8080` | API proxy |
| Gateway Admin UI | `http://localhost:8080/admin/` | Direct admin access |
| Benchmark Servers | `http://localhost:9000-9099` | MCP benchmark targets |

Verify:

- The Admin UI renders correctly inside the iframe harness at `http://localhost:8889`
- Benchmark servers are auto-registered and their tools appear in the catalog
- Navigation, tool execution, and resource browsing work within the embedded context

Tear down when done:

```bash
make embedded-down
```

### 6.4 Python package build

```bash
make dist
make verify
```

Builds the wheel and sdist, then validates with twine, check-manifest, and pyroma.

---

## 7. SSO Verification

Verify the SSO login flow works end-to-end with Keycloak:

```bash
make compose-sso
```

This starts the full stack with the SSO profile, including a Keycloak instance:

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Gateway | `http://localhost:8080` | SSO login via Keycloak |
| Keycloak | `http://localhost:8180` | `admin` / `changeme` |

Verify:

- Navigate to the Admin UI at `http://localhost:8080/admin/` and confirm the SSO login redirect to Keycloak
- Log in with the Keycloak credentials and verify the redirect back to the Admin UI with a valid session
- Confirm that RBAC roles from Keycloak tokens are correctly mapped and enforced
- Test logout and verify the session is invalidated

Tear down when done:

```bash
make compose-sso-down
```

---

## 8. Observability Verification

Verify the monitoring stack works correctly under active load. This must be done while the compose stack is running.

### 8.1 Start the monitoring stack

```bash
make monitoring-up
```

This starts Prometheus, Grafana, and Tempo with OTEL tracing enabled:

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| Grafana | `http://localhost:3000` | `admin` / `changeme` |
| Prometheus | `http://localhost:9090` | — |
| Tempo | `http://localhost:3200` | OTLP: 4317 (gRPC), 4318 (HTTP) |

### 8.2 Run a load test with monitoring active

```bash
make load-test-cli
```

While the load test is running, verify in Grafana:

- The **MCP Gateway Overview** dashboard populates with live metrics
- Request rate, latency percentiles, and error rate graphs are rendering
- Prometheus targets are all in `UP` state at `http://localhost:9090/targets`
- Traces are flowing into Tempo and visible from the Grafana Explore view

### 8.3 Teardown

```bash
make monitoring-down
```

---

## 9. Security & Analysis

### 9.1 SonarQube analysis

Start SonarQube and submit a scan:

```bash
# Start SonarQube (pick your runtime)
make sonar-up-docker    # or: make sonar-up-podman

# Submit the scan
make sonar-submit-docker  # or: make sonar-submit-podman
```

**Acceptance criteria:** Clean SonarQube report — no new bugs, vulnerabilities, or security hotspots. Review any code smells and technical debt.

!!! tip "First-time setup"
    Run `make sonar-info` for instructions on generating the SonarQube authentication token.

### 9.2 Semgrep security analysis

Run Semgrep with the auto ruleset to detect security anti-patterns, injection risks, and unsafe code:

```bash
make semgrep
```

Semgrep scans the `mcpgateway/` source for patterns including SQL injection, command injection, SSRF, insecure deserialization, and framework-specific misuse. Review any findings and fix or justify before release.

### 9.3 SBOM generation

Generate a Software Bill of Materials for the release:

```bash
make sbom
```

This produces a CycloneDX XML SBOM (`mcpgateway.sbom.xml`) listing all Python dependencies and their versions. Include the SBOM as a release artifact or attach it to the GitHub Release.

### 9.4 Container security scanning

The CI pipeline (`docker-scan.yml`) builds the container image and generates an SBOM artifact for review. For local verification, see also [Section 6.2](#62-containerfile-linting-and-image-scanning).

---

## 10. Deployment Verification

### 10.1 Helm chart lint and IaC security scanning

```bash
make helm-lint linting-security-kube-linter linting-security-checkov
```

| Target | What it checks |
|--------|----------------|
| `helm-lint` | Helm chart static analysis for correctness |
| `linting-security-kube-linter` | Kubernetes best-practice linting (resource limits, security contexts, probes) |
| `linting-security-checkov` | IaC security scanning across Dockerfiles, docker-compose files, Helm charts, and k8s manifests |

### 10.2 Helm chart package

```bash
make helm-package
```

Packages the chart into `dist/mcp-stack-<version>.tgz`.

### 10.3 Minikube deployment

Deploy to a local Minikube cluster to verify the Helm chart works end-to-end:

```bash
# Start Minikube (if not already running)
make minikube-start

# Load the freshly built image
make minikube-image-load

# Deploy via Helm
make helm-deploy

# Verify pods are healthy
make minikube-status

# Port-forward and smoke test
make minikube-port-forward
```

Verify the application starts, the health endpoint responds, and basic functionality works through the forwarded port.

### 10.4 Teardown

```bash
make helm-delete
make minikube-stop
```

---

## 11. Documentation Verification

Verify the documentation builds cleanly, has no broken links, and is ready for deployment.

### 11.1 Check for broken links

```bash
make linting-docs-markdown-links
```

Scans Markdown files for broken internal and external links. Fix any broken references before release.

### 11.2 Build and preview documentation

```bash
cd docs && make serve
```

This starts a local MkDocs development server. Manually review:

- The new version's content is accurate and complete
- Navigation structure is correct
- No rendering issues in code blocks, tables, or admonitions
- Release-specific pages (CHANGELOG, roadmap) reflect the current release

### 11.3 Deploy versioned documentation

Deploy the documentation for the release version using mike. This creates a version-specific folder on the `gh-pages` branch:

```bash
cd docs

# Deploy the version (e.g., 1.0.0) with 'latest' alias
make mike-deploy VERSION=1.0.0

# Set as default version (landing page)
make mike-set-default
```

**Versioning strategy:**

- Documentation is maintained in `main` branch alongside code changes
- When cutting a release tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`), deploy docs to that version
- Each version gets its own folder on `gh-pages`: `1.0.0/`, `1.0.1/`, etc.
- The `latest` alias points to the newest release
- Old versions remain accessible but are not updated (frozen at release time)

**Version deployment workflow:**

```bash
cd docs

# For stable releases (deploys with 'latest' alias)
make mike-deploy VERSION=1.0.0

# For release candidates
make mike-deploy VERSION=1.0.0-RC1

# For development previews
make mike-deploy VERSION=dev

# Set default version (landing page)
make mike-set-default

# Delete a version
make mike-delete VERSION=0.8.0
```

**Verify deployment:**

```bash
cd docs
make mike-list  # Show all deployed versions
```

**Local preview:**

```bash
cd docs
make mike-serve  # http://localhost:8000 with version selector
```

The version selector in the docs UI (top right) allows users to switch between versions.

!!! note "Single source, multiple deployments"
    This strategy maintains a single documentation source in `main` that evolves with the code. Each release tag triggers a versioned deployment, creating a snapshot of the docs at that point in time. No separate version branches are needed.

---

## 12. Plugin Testing

Verify the plugin framework and key plugins work correctly. This requires the compose stack to be running with `PLUGINS_ENABLED=true` (the default in `docker-compose.yml`).

### 12.1 Enable the PII filter plugin

Edit `plugins/config.yaml` to set the PII filter plugin to enforce mode:

```yaml
- name: "PIIFilterPlugin"
  kind: "cpex_pii_filter.PIIFilterPlugin"
  hooks:
    [
      "tool_pre_invoke",
      "tool_post_invoke",
    ]
  mode: "enforce"  # Change from "disabled" to "enforce"
  priority: 50
  config:
    detect_ssn: true
    detect_credit_card: true
    detect_email: true
    detect_phone: true
    detect_ip_address: true
    detect_aws_keys: true
    detect_api_keys: true
    default_mask_strategy: "partial"
    block_on_detection: false
    log_detections: true
    include_detection_details: true
```

Restart the compose stack to pick up the change:

```bash
make compose-restart
```

### 12.2 Test PII detection on tool invocation

Register a simple REST tool and invoke it with PII-laden arguments to verify the plugin intercepts and masks sensitive data:

```bash
# Create a tool that echoes its input
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "tool": {
         "name": "echo_tool",
         "description": "Echoes input for testing",
         "url": "https://httpbin.org/post",
         "request_type": "POST",
         "integration_type": "REST",
         "input_schema": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
             "message": {"type": "string", "description": "Message to echo"}
           }
         }
       }
     }' \
     "$BASE_URL/tools" | jq
```

The create response returns the canonical tool name as `echo-tool` (hyphenated). Use that name for JSON-RPC tool calls.

Invoke the tool with supported PII types and verify masking:

```bash
# Test with SSN
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"echo-tool","arguments":{"message":"My SSN is 123-45-6789"}}}' \
     "$BASE_URL/rpc" | jq

# Test with credit card number
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"echo-tool","arguments":{"message":"Card: 4111-1111-1111-1111"}}}' \
     "$BASE_URL/rpc" | jq

# Test with email address
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"echo-tool","arguments":{"message":"Contact john.doe@example.com for details"}}}' \
     "$BASE_URL/rpc" | jq

# Test with phone number
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"echo-tool","arguments":{"message":"Call me at 212-555-0199"}}}' \
     "$BASE_URL/rpc" | jq
```

**Acceptance criteria:** Each response should show the PII values masked in the upstream payload returned by httpbin (for example, `123-45-6789` becomes `***-**-6789`). The original PII must not appear in the tool invocation payload. If `tools/call` returns an ambiguous tool error, remove duplicate `echo-tool` entries or create the test tool with a unique name and invoke the returned canonical name.

### 12.3 Test PII detection via MCP protocol

Create a virtual server for the tool and invoke it through the Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint:

```bash
# Create a virtual server that exposes the echo tool.
# Replace TOOL_ID with the id from the /tools create response above.
curl -sS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "server": {
         "name": "step12-pii-server",
         "description": "Step 12 PII MCP verification",
         "associated_tools": ["TOOL_ID"]
       },
       "visibility": "public"
     }' \
     "$BASE_URL/servers" | jq
```

Initialize an MCP session against the returned server id:

```bash
SERVER_ID="..."  # id from the /servers create response

curl -i -sS -X POST "$BASE_URL/servers/$SERVER_ID/mcp/" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-25" \
     -d '{
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "id": 1,
       "method": "initialize",
       "params": {
         "protocolVersion": "2025-11-25",
         "capabilities": {},
         "clientInfo": {"name": "step12-curl", "version": "1.0.0"}
       }
     }'
```

Copy the `mcp-session-id` response header, then call the tool through MCP:

```bash
MCP_SESSION_ID="..."  # mcp-session-id response header from initialize

curl -sS -X POST "$BASE_URL/servers/$SERVER_ID/mcp/" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-25" \
     -H "mcp-session-id: $MCP_SESSION_ID" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"echo-tool","arguments":{"message":"My SSN is 123-45-6789"}}}' \
     | jq
```

**Acceptance criteria:** The MCP `tools/call` response should show the SSN masked in the upstream payload, and the original `123-45-6789` value must not appear.

### 12.4 Verify plugin health and status

Check the plugin framework is healthy via the Admin UI or API. The bearer token must have the `admin.plugins` permission, so generate a platform admin token before calling the endpoint:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(grep '^JWT_SECRET_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)

export MCPGATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN=$(./.venv/bin/python -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token \
  --username admin@example.com \
  --admin \
  --exp 10080 \
  --secret "$JWT_SECRET_KEY" \
  --algo HS256 \
  2>/dev/null | tail -n 1)

curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     "$BASE_URL/admin/plugins/PIIFilterPlugin" | jq '{name,status,mode,hooks,kind}'
```

Verify:

- The PII filter plugin shows `status: enabled` and `mode: enforce`
- The plugin has both `tool_pre_invoke` and `tool_post_invoke` in `hooks`
- No plugin errors appear in the gateway logs (`make compose-logs | grep -i plugin`)

### 12.5 Cleanup

Reset the plugin config back to disabled mode before proceeding:

```yaml
mode: "disabled"  # Revert to disabled
```

```bash
make compose-restart
```

---

## 13. Upgrade Testing

Verify that Alembic database migrations work correctly when upgrading from a previous release. The upgrade validation harness tests four scenarios: SQLite fresh, SQLite upgrade, PostgreSQL fresh, and PostgreSQL upgrade.

### 13.1 Automated upgrade validation

The `upgrade-validate` target runs the full validation harness automatically. It defaults to upgrading from `1.0.0-BETA-2` to the locally built image:

```bash
# Build the current image first
make docker-prod DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS="--no-cache"

# Run all four upgrade scenarios
make upgrade-validate
```

This executes `scripts/ci/run_upgrade_validation.sh`, which:

1. **SQLite fresh install** — starts the target image with a new SQLite database, verifies the Alembic head is correct
2. **SQLite upgrade** — starts the base image (`1.0.0-BETA-2`), seeds marker data, stops it, starts the target image against the same database file, verifies migrations ran and data is preserved
3. **PostgreSQL fresh install** — starts a fresh Postgres 18 container and the target image, verifies the Alembic head
4. **PostgreSQL upgrade** — starts the base image against Postgres, seeds marker data, swaps to the target image, verifies migrations and data preservation

**Acceptance criteria:** All four scenarios pass. The Alembic version in the database matches the expected single head, and seeded marker data survives the upgrade.

### 13.2 Custom base version

To test upgrades from a different release:

```bash
make upgrade-validate \
  UPGRADE_BASE_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ibm/mcp-context-forge:1.0.0-RC-1 \
  UPGRADE_TARGET_IMAGE=mcpgateway/mcpgateway:latest
```

### 13.3 Manual compose upgrade test (PostgreSQL)

For a more realistic test that exercises the full compose stack and PgBouncer:

```bash
# 1. Start with the old release image
make compose-clean
```

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to use the old release image:

```yaml
gateway:
  image: ghcr.io/ibm/mcp-context-forge:1.0.0-BETA-2
  #image: ${IMAGE_LOCAL:-mcpgateway/mcpgateway:latest}
```

```bash
# 2. Bring up the old stack and seed some data
make compose-up
make compose-ps   # verify all services are healthy

# Seed data: register a gateway, create a virtual server, create a tool
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"upgrade_test_gw","url":"http://localhost:8002/sse"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/gateways | jq

curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"upgrade_test_server","description":"Pre-upgrade server"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/servers | jq

# 3. Stop the stack (preserves Postgres volume)
make compose-down
```

Swap back to the local latest image:

```yaml
gateway:
  image: ${IMAGE_LOCAL:-mcpgateway/mcpgateway:latest}
  #image: ghcr.io/ibm/mcp-context-forge:1.0.0-BETA-2
```

```bash
# 4. Bring up with the new image (Alembic auto-migrates on startup)
make compose-up
make compose-ps   # verify all services are healthy

# 5. Verify data survived the upgrade
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8080/gateways | jq '.[] | select(.name=="upgrade_test_gw")'

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:8080/servers | jq '.[] | select(.name=="upgrade_test_server")'
```

Verify:

- The gateway starts without migration errors in the logs (`make compose-logs | grep -i alembic`)
- Previously created gateways, servers, and tools are present and intact
- The Admin UI loads and displays the pre-upgrade data
- New features from the current release are functional

### 13.4 Manual SQLite upgrade test

For SQLite, the upgrade path can be tested without compose:

```bash
# 1. Run the old image with a mounted SQLite volume
mkdir -p /tmp/upgrade-test-sqlite
docker run -d --name upgrade-old \
  -p 4444:4444 \
  -e "DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/data/mcp.db" \
  -e "AUTH_REQUIRED=false" \
  -e "HOST=0.0.0.0" -e "PORT=4444" \
  -e "MCPGATEWAY_UI_ENABLED=true" \
  -e "MCPGATEWAY_ADMIN_API_ENABLED=true" \
  -v /tmp/upgrade-test-sqlite:/app/data \
  ghcr.io/ibm/mcp-context-forge:1.0.0-BETA-2

# Wait for health, seed data, stop
curl --retry 30 --retry-delay 2 -sf http://localhost:4444/health
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"sqlite_upgrade_test","url":"http://example.com/sse"}' \
     http://localhost:4444/gateways | jq
docker stop upgrade-old && docker rm upgrade-old

# 2. Run the new image against the same database file
docker run -d --name upgrade-new \
  -p 4444:4444 \
  -e "DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////app/data/mcp.db" \
  -e "AUTH_REQUIRED=false" \
  -e "HOST=0.0.0.0" -e "PORT=4444" \
  -e "MCPGATEWAY_UI_ENABLED=true" \
  -e "MCPGATEWAY_ADMIN_API_ENABLED=true" \
  -v /tmp/upgrade-test-sqlite:/app/data \
  mcpgateway/mcpgateway:latest

# 3. Verify
curl --retry 30 --retry-delay 2 -sf http://localhost:4444/health
curl -s http://localhost:4444/gateways | jq '.[] | select(.name=="sqlite_upgrade_test")'

# 4. Cleanup
docker stop upgrade-new && docker rm upgrade-new
rm -rf /tmp/upgrade-test-sqlite
```

### 13.5 Comprehensive migration test suite

For deeper migration testing across multiple version pairs (forward, reverse, skip-version):

```bash
# Run the full migration test suite
make migration-test-all

# Or run database-specific tests
make migration-test-sqlite
make migration-test-postgres
make migration-test-performance
```

The migration test suite follows an **n-2 support policy** and tests sequential upgrades, downgrades, and skip-version jumps. See `tests/migration/README.md` for full documentation.

---

## 14. Manual Testing

These tests verify core user-facing workflows that automated tests do not fully cover.

Before starting, ensure `.env` has a real JWT secret (the default `.env` ships with a placeholder that breaks token authentication):

```bash
# Generate secrets and merge into .env (skip if already done)
make init-secrets
# Confirm JWT_SECRET_KEY is no longer the placeholder
grep JWT_SECRET_KEY .env   # must not contain __REPLACE_ME__
```

Build and start the compose stack:

```bash
make docker-prod && make testing-up
```

### 14.1 Generate a JWT token

Create a token for API and client access:

```bash
# JWT_SECRET_KEY must match the value in .env (run make init-secrets if not set)
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(grep '^JWT_SECRET_KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2-)

export MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN=$(python -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token \
  --username admin@example.com \
  --exp 10080 \
  --secret "$JWT_SECRET_KEY")

export BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"
```

### 14.2 Register an MCP server via SSE

The translate process must bind to `0.0.0.0` so the gateway container can reach it via `host.docker.internal`:

```bash
# Start MCP time server exposed via SSE (bind to 0.0.0.0 for Docker reachability)
python3 -m mcpgateway.translate \
  --stdio "uvx mcp-server-time --local-timezone=UTC" \
  --expose-sse \
  --port 8002 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 &

# Register with gateway (use host.docker.internal since gateway runs in Docker)
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"release_test_sse","url":"http://host.docker.internal:8002/sse"}' \
     $BASE_URL/gateways | jq

# Verify tools appear in catalog
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" $BASE_URL/tools | jq
```

**Expected:** Each tool object contains `gateway_id` (UUID of the registering gateway) but no `gateway_name` field — the `/tools` API does not denormalize the gateway name. To resolve a human-readable name, call `GET /gateways/<gateway_id>`. This is by design.

### 14.3 Register an MCP server via Streamable HTTP

Streamable HTTP transport requires the `--expose-streamable-http` flag and an explicit `"transport":"STREAMABLEHTTP"` field in the registration payload — the gateway does not auto-detect transport from the URL:

```bash
# Start MCP server exposed via Streamable HTTP
python3 -m mcpgateway.translate \
  --stdio "uvx mcp-server-time --local-timezone=UTC" \
  --expose-streamable-http \
  --port 8003 \
  --host 0.0.0.0 &

# Register with gateway (explicit transport field required)
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name":"release_test_streamable","url":"http://host.docker.internal:8003/mcp","transport":"STREAMABLEHTTP"}' \
     $BASE_URL/gateways | jq

# Verify tools
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" $BASE_URL/tools | jq
```

**Expected:** Tools from both gateways appear in the catalog, each with `gateway_id` populated. As with SSE, `gateway_name` is not included in the response; use `GET /gateways/<gateway_id>` to resolve the name.

### 14.4 Create a virtual server and export it

The request body must wrap the server fields under a `"server"` key:

```bash
# Create virtual server
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"server":{"name":"release_test_server","description":"Release validation tools","associatedTools":[]}}' \
     $BASE_URL/servers | jq

# Verify (shows id, name, associatedTools)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN" $BASE_URL/servers | jq '[.[] | {id, name, associatedTools}]'
```

Export the configuration for backup verification. Override `HOST`/`PORT` via env — do not use a `--url` flag:

```bash
MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN=$MCPGATEWAY_BEARER_TOKEN HOST=localhost PORT=8080 \
  python -m mcpgateway.cli export --out release-test-export.json
```

**Expected:** The export file contains the virtual server, both registered gateways, and any standalone (local REST) tools. MCP gateway-discovered tools — those imported from an upstream MCP server — are intentionally excluded from the `tools` list in the export. They are considered ephemeral: when the gateway is re-imported, the tools are re-discovered automatically. Only standalone tools created directly via `POST /tools` appear as independent exported entities. Verify that `entities.gateways` contains both `release_test_sse` and `release_test_streamable`, and `entities.servers` contains `release_test_server`.

### 14.5 Test with MCP Inspector

Registered MCP gateways cannot be accessed directly via Inspector — they must be exposed through a virtual server. Add the SSE and Streamable HTTP gateways to `release_test_server` via the Admin UI or API, then connect Inspector to the virtual server.

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

In the Inspector UI:

1. Set **Transport** to `SSE`
2. Set **URL** to `$BASE_URL/servers/<VIRTUAL_SERVER_UUID>/sse`
3. Set **Header** `Authorization` to `Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>`
4. Click **Connect**
5. Verify: tools from both registered gateways appear, you can execute a tool call, and the response is correct

Repeat with **Streamable HTTP**:

1. Set **Transport** to `Streamable HTTP`
2. Set **URL** to `$BASE_URL/servers/<VIRTUAL_SERVER_UUID>/mcp`
3. Set the same Authorization header
4. Verify: tools list loads and tool calls execute correctly

> **Note:** Streamable HTTP is a stateful protocol. Before `tools/list` can be called, the client must complete an `initialize` handshake, which the server responds to with a `Mcp-Session-Id` header. All subsequent requests must include that header. MCP Inspector handles this automatically. Raw `curl` calls that skip `initialize` will receive a `-32600 Missing session ID` error — this is expected protocol behaviour, not a gateway bug.

### 14.6 Test with VS Code (GitHub Copilot)

Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` in a test workspace to verify the IDE integration end-to-end.

**SSE configuration:**

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "contextforge-sse": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/servers/<VIRTUAL_SERVER_UUID>/sse",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Streamable HTTP configuration:**

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "contextforge-http": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/servers/<VIRTUAL_SERVER_UUID>/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Verify in VS Code (requires VS Code >= 1.99 with `"chat.mcp.enabled": true`):

1. Open the Copilot chat panel
2. Confirm the MCP server status indicator shows connected
3. Ask Copilot to use one of the registered tools (e.g., "What time is it?")
4. Verify the tool call executes and returns a valid response
5. Test with both SSE and Streamable HTTP configurations

### 14.7 Cleanup

Stop the sample MCP servers and remove test artifacts:

```bash
# Stop background translate processes
kill %1 %2 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove test export
rm -f release-test-export.json
```

---

## 15. Draft Release

### 15.1 Commit the version bump

Once all gates pass, commit the version changes:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -s -m "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
```

!!! note "DCO requirement"
    All commits must be signed off (`-s` flag) per the project's Developer Certificate of Origin policy.

### 15.2 Tag the release

```bash
git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main --tags
```

The tag format is `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.0-RC-2`) as configured in `.bumpversion.cfg`.

### 15.3 Create the GitHub Release

Create a release on GitHub from the tag. The release notes should include:

1. **Summary** — One-paragraph description of the release focus
2. **Highlights** — Bullet list of the most notable changes
3. **Breaking Changes** — Migration instructions for any breaking changes (copy from CHANGELOG)
4. **New Features** — Key new capabilities
5. **Bug Fixes** — Notable fixes
6. **Security** — Security-related changes
7. **Upgrade Instructions** — Link to the [upgrade guide](../manage/upgrade.md) with any release-specific notes
8. **Full Changelog** — Link to the diff between the previous and current tag

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  --title "vX.Y.Z - Release Title" \
  --notes-file release-notes.md
```

!!! important "CI triggers on release publish"
    Publishing the GitHub Release creates the git tag, which triggers the `docker-multiplatform.yml` workflow. On a `v*` tag push it builds all platform images (amd64, arm64, s390x, ppc64le), creates the multiplatform manifest tagged with the semantic version and `latest`, and signs the image with Cosign.

### 15.4 Verify CI release pipeline

After publishing, verify that the `docker-multiplatform.yml` workflow completes successfully:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=docker-multiplatform.yml --limit=1
```

Confirm the container image is available at `ghcr.io/ibm/mcp-context-forge:vX.Y.Z`.

---

## 16. Post-Release

### 16.1 Close the milestone

If not already done in step 1.5, close the GitHub milestone and ensure all issues are accounted for.
- Move all remaining open issues to the next milestone
- Close the current milestone on GitHub

---

### 16.2 Create the next milestone

Create the next milestone on GitHub with the planned due date from the roadmap.

### 16.3 Verify documentation deployment

If the documentation site auto-deploys, verify the new version's docs are live and the release notes are visible.

### 16.4 Announce the release

Notify relevant channels (GitHub Discussions, Slack, mailing list, etc.) with a summary of the release highlights.
