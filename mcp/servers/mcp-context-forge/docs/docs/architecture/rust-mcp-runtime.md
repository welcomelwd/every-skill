# Rust MCP Runtime

!!! warning "Deprecated as of 2026-06-11; sunsets on 2026-07-07"
    The Rust MCP runtime sidecar is deprecated.
    New deployments should use the default Python MCP transport.
    See [Deprecations](../deprecations.md).

The Rust MCP runtime is an optional sidecar/runtime path for ContextForge's
streamable HTTP MCP traffic. It is designed to move the public MCP hot path out
of Python incrementally while keeping Python authoritative for authentication,
token scoping, and RBAC.

It is also the first concrete precedent for the broader
[Modular Runtime Architecture](modular-design.md): a protocol-specific runtime
that can move out of the Python process while the core platform remains the
shared policy and control plane. The generalized implementor-facing contract
for future modules is documented in the
[Modular Runtime Specification](modular-runtime/index.md).

This page describes the current architecture and the supported rollout modes.

## Mode Model

The user-facing control is `RUST_MCP_MODE`:

| Mode | Public `/mcp` ingress | Rust session/event/resume/live-stream cores | Intended use |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `off` | Python | No | Baseline Python MCP path |
| `shadow` | Python | No public Rust ownership | Safety-first rollback/comparison mode with Rust sidecar present |
| `edge` | Rust | No | Direct public Rust ingress with Python still backing more MCP internals |
| `full` | Rust | Yes | Fastest public Rust path with Rust-owned MCP session/runtime cores |

Use the testing stack wrappers to bring these up locally:

```bash
make testing-rebuild-rust-shadow
make testing-rebuild-rust
make testing-rebuild-rust-full
```

## Runtime Mode Override

!!! warning "Deprecated runtime controls"
    `RUST_MCP_MODE` and the related runtime override APIs
    control deprecated Rust sidecar paths. They remain for compatibility.

The boot env var `RUST_MCP_MODE` still picks the initial
mode. When the boot mode is `edge` an authorized admin can flip the public
`/mcp` ingress between `shadow` and `edge` at runtime, without a restart.

**Why only `edge`?** The repo's safety invariant for routing public traffic
to Rust requires BOTH `experimental_rust_mcp_runtime_enabled` and
`experimental_rust_mcp_session_auth_reuse_enabled`. Only `edge` boot
sets both flags. A `shadow`-booted deployment has the Rust sidecar present
but session-auth-reuse disabled, so an override to `edge` cannot safely
route public traffic — the API rejects such PATCHes with 409. Operators who
want runtime flippability must boot with `edge`; from there they can flip
to `shadow` (forces Python path) and back to `edge` (restores default)
freely.

| Method | Path | Body | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/admin/runtime/mcp-mode` | — | `admin.system_config` |
| PATCH | `/admin/runtime/mcp-mode` | `{"mode": "shadow" \| "edge"}` | `admin.system_config` |

Behavior:

- The override lives in process memory. A restart re-reads `RUST_MCP_MODE`;
  there is no new persistence surface in Postgres.
- Drain semantics are natural: in-flight requests complete on their original
  transport and only newly-accepted requests follow the flip.
- Runtime flip gating is per-target-mode:
  - `mode=shadow` is accepted from any boot that has a dispatcher mounted
    (`shadow` or `edge`). This is the **escape hatch** — it lets admins
    clear a stale `override=edge` that landed via a Redis hint inherited
    from a prior edge-boot deploy, without needing to flush Redis by hand.
  - `mode=edge` is accepted only from `boot_mode=edge`, which is the only
    configuration where the session-auth-reuse / delegate-enabled safety
    invariant is met.
  - `off` and `full` boot modes return `409` for every PATCH: `off` has no
    Rust sidecar, `full` mounts a plain Rust proxy with no dispatcher so
    an override can't take effect.
- The coordinator's boot reconciliation (and the live pub/sub listener)
  discards messages whose mode cannot safely take effect on the current
  deployment. The reason surfaces via `/health` under
  `mcp_runtime.boot_reconcile_status` as one of:
  - `incompatible_no_dispatcher`: any hint on a `boot=off` deploy (no Rust
    sidecar, no mechanism to honor the override).
  - `incompatible_boot_full`: any hint on a `boot=full` deploy (plain Rust
    proxy mounted with no dispatcher; the override would strand).
  - `incompatible_safety_flag`: an `edge` hint on a `boot=shadow` deploy
    (the session-auth-reuse / delegate-enabled safety invariant is unmet).

  The Redis hint key is intentionally NOT deleted on discard — a future
  compatible-boot pod must still be able to read it, and stale hints
  expire on their own via the 24h TTL set at publish time. An operator
  who wants to clear immediately can `DEL contextforge:runtime:mode_state:{runtime}`.

  The same compatibility check runs on every live pub/sub message: a
  remote pod's flip that the local deployment can't safely honor is
  discarded with a WARN log (no INCOMPATIBLE_* state is recorded for live
  discards because they don't represent boot state — only a log line).
- Each successful flip writes a `runtime_config` audit trail entry via the
  existing `SecurityLogger.log_data_access` pathway. Audit-write failures
  caused by transient DB issues do not roll back the flip — the response
  body reports `audit_persisted: false` so the caller knows the audit gap.
- When Redis is attached but the version counter cannot be safely allocated
  (`INCR` fails or returns a value not greater than the local floor), the
  PATCH returns `503 Service Unavailable`. Falling back to a local version
  could collide with a concurrent PATCH on a peer pod and silently lose one
  of the two flips at peer dedup time.
- The PATCH response includes:
  - `publish_status: "propagated" | "local-only" | "failed" | "superseded"`
    so the caller knows whether peers received the flip.
  - `audit_persisted: bool`.
- The currently effective mode and propagation status surface on `/health`
  under `mcp_runtime` (`boot_mode`, `effective_mode`,
  `override_active`, `cluster_propagation`, `last_change`).
- `cluster_propagation` is one of:
  - `"redis"` — coordinator is publishing/subscribing successfully.
  - `"disabled"` — Redis is intentionally not configured for this deployment.
  - `"degraded"` — Redis is configured but the coordinator failed to attach;
    operators should treat this as alertable (e.g. fail readiness or page).

### Reverse-proxy deployments — important caveat

The override updates the Python gateway's in-process state (and propagates
across pods via Redis), but the public `/mcp` ingress is sometimes terminated
by an upstream reverse proxy (typically nginx) before reaching the Python
gateway. In that topology a runtime flip is **observable but not
behavior-changing** at the public ingress until the proxy is reconfigured.

Two deployment shapes:

1. **Single-process / no proxy** (FastAPI on `:4444` is the only public
   ingress). Runtime flips are end-to-end functional **for `boot_mode=edge`**;
   `boot_mode=shadow` accepts `mode=shadow` PATCHes as a clearance
   escape hatch but cannot be promoted to `mode=edge` (see the 409
   contract above). The `/mcp` mount is the per-request
   `MCPStreamableHTTPModeDispatcher`, which reads the override on every
   request. Boot modes `off` and `full` are not flippable at all.

2. **Reverse-proxy in front** (e.g. nginx routing public `GET/POST/DELETE
   /mcp` either to `gateway:4444` for Python or directly to the Rust public
   listener at `gateway:8787` for edge/full). The nginx config is decided
   at deploy time from `RUST_MCP_MODE`. **The proxy is not aware of the
   runtime override.** Symptoms:

   - `edge` → `shadow` flip: the gateway's Python path is now ready to
     serve `/mcp`, but nginx is still routing to `:8787`. Public traffic
     continues to land on Rust until nginx is updated.
   - `shadow` → `edge` flip: FastAPI on `:4444` is now configured to proxy
     to Rust, but nginx is still routing all public `/mcp` to `:4444`.
     Traffic does not reach the Rust public listener directly. (Note:
     because the Python proxy still forwards to the Rust sidecar over the
     internal UDS/loopback URL, requests still execute against Rust — but
     the latency benefit of bypassing Python is not realized.)

Until the proxy can follow the override, treat the API as a **single-pod
control surface**: useful for CI / compliance harnesses that talk straight
to FastAPI, and for incident-rollback scenarios where you also have a
mechanism to update the proxy. For production reverse-proxy deployments,
plan to either:

- Update the proxy config alongside the API call (e.g. write the new mode
  to a shared store the proxy consults, or run a configuration-management
  step that rewrites nginx and reloads it), or
- Use the API only for the single-pod / single-process scenarios above.

Tracking issue for an nginx-side mechanism (e.g. an OpenResty lua module
that consults the Redis hint key) is
[#4278](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/issues/4278).

### Cluster-wide propagation

When `REDIS_URL` is configured, every pod runs a `RuntimeStateCoordinator`
that subscribes to the `contextforge:runtime:mode` pub/sub channel. A
successful PATCH on any pod publishes a versioned message; every other pod
applies it under monotonic versioning (last writer wins, ties impossible
because the version is allocated via `INCR` on a per-runtime Redis counter).

A short-lived hint key (`contextforge:runtime:mode_state:mcp`, TTL 24h) lets a
freshly started pod reconcile to the cluster's current desired override on boot.

When Redis is unavailable, the coordinator degrades to per-pod scope; the
endpoint still works on the pod that received the PATCH and the response
payload reports `cluster_propagation: "disabled"` so operators know to flip
each pod individually.

To revert the cluster to env-var defaults, delete the hint key and restart
the pods:

```bash
redis-cli DEL contextforge:runtime:mode_state:mcp
```

### Quick-start examples

```bash
# Inspect current mode (any pod)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" .../admin/runtime/mcp-mode

# Flip the public /mcp ingress back to Python (incident rollback)
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"mode": "shadow"}' \
     .../admin/runtime/mcp-mode
```

## Request Flows

### `off` and `shadow`

In `off` and `shadow`, the public MCP path remains Python-owned:

```text
client
  -> nginx
  -> Python gateway transport/auth/token scoping/RBAC
  -> Python MCP handlers
  -> upstream MCP server
```

`shadow` differs from `off` only in that the Rust sidecar is present and can be
used for internal validation and comparison; it does not own the public MCP
transport.

### `edge` and `full`

In `edge` and `full`, nginx routes public `GET/POST/DELETE /mcp` directly to
the Rust runtime:

```text
client
  -> nginx
  -> Rust public listener
  -> trusted Python auth endpoint (internal)
  -> Rust MCP routing/execution/session logic
  -> upstream MCP server or narrow Python internal endpoint
```

Important details:

- Direct public Rust ingress is enabled by the dedicated public listener set up
  from `RUST_MCP_MODE=edge|full`.
- Rust authenticates public traffic through the trusted Python internal endpoint
  `POST /_internal/mcp/authenticate`.
- Rust strips forwarded/proxy-chain headers on the trusted Rust -> Python hop so
  Python evaluates the request as an internal runtime dispatch rather than as an
  external client IP.

## Responsibility Split

The current split is intentionally conservative:

| Concern | Python | Rust |
|---------|--------|------|
| JWT authentication | Yes | Via trusted internal Python auth |
| Token scoping / team visibility | Yes | Consumes authenticated context |
| RBAC | Yes | Enforces Python-authenticated result |
| Public MCP HTTP edge | `off`, `shadow` | `edge`, `full` |
| Session registry | Python in `off`, `shadow` | Rust in `full` |
| Event store / replay / resume | Python in `off`, `shadow`, `edge` | Rust in `full` |
| Live `GET /mcp` SSE edge | Python in `off`, `shadow`, `edge` | Rust in `full` |
| Affinity / owner-worker forwarding | Python in `off`, `shadow`, `edge` | Rust in `full` |
| Direct `tools/call` execution | Python fallback still exists | Rust hot path when eligible |

The important architectural point is that Rust does not currently replace the
full security model. Python remains the authority for auth and RBAC while Rust
owns progressively more of the public MCP transport and session/runtime work.

## Session/Auth Reuse Model

To reduce repeated auth overhead on session-bound MCP traffic, Rust can reuse
authenticated context for an established MCP session. This is not a global
per-user cache. It is bound to the MCP session and validated against the
original authenticated context.

Key invariants:

- a session belongs to exactly one authenticated caller context
- a different caller cannot reuse the same `mcp-session-id`
- a changed auth binding on the same session is denied rather than reused
- replay/resume and delete operations preserve the same ownership checks

This model is validated by the dedicated isolation suite:

```bash
make test-mcp-session-isolation
```

See the detailed threat model and test matrix in
`crates/mcp_runtime/TESTING-DESIGN.md` in the repository.

## Verification

After bringing up the stack, verify the active mode through `/health`:

```bash
curl -sD - http://localhost:8080/health -o /dev/null | rg 'x-contextforge-mcp-'
```

Representative full-Rust headers:

```text
x-contextforge-mcp-runtime-mode: rust-managed
x-contextforge-mcp-transport-mounted: rust
x-contextforge-mcp-session-core-mode: rust
x-contextforge-mcp-event-store-mode: rust
x-contextforge-mcp-resume-core-mode: rust
x-contextforge-mcp-live-stream-core-mode: rust
x-contextforge-mcp-affinity-core-mode: rust
x-contextforge-mcp-session-auth-reuse-mode: rust
```

Representative shadow-mode headers:

```text
x-contextforge-mcp-runtime-mode: rust-managed
x-contextforge-mcp-transport-mounted: python
x-contextforge-mcp-session-core-mode: python
x-contextforge-mcp-event-store-mode: python

x-contextforge-mcp-affinity-core-mode: python
x-contextforge-mcp-session-auth-reuse-mode: python
```

## Plugin Execution and tools/call Flow

The Rust runtime does not execute plugin code directly. All plugin
execution happens in Python, with results communicated to Rust over internal
HTTP RPC endpoints.

### Internal RPC Endpoints

Rust derives internal endpoint URLs from its `--backend-rpc-url`
configuration. The following endpoints exist on the Python side:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /_internal/mcp/authenticate` | JWT validation, token scoping, RBAC context |
| `POST /_internal/mcp/tools/call/resolve` | Build execution plan; runs pre-invoke plugin hooks |
| `POST /_internal/mcp/tools/call` | Full Python fallback execution with all plugins |
| `POST /_internal/mcp/tools/call/metric` | Record tool execution timing and success/failure |

These are trusted internal endpoints, not exposed to external clients.

### tools/call Request Flow (edge and full modes)

When a `tools/call` request arrives at the Rust runtime in `edge` or `full`
mode, it follows a two-phase resolve-then-execute model:

```text
client
  -> nginx
  -> Rust public listener
  -> Rust: POST /_internal/mcp/tools/call/resolve (Python)
     -> Python: auth + RBAC + tool lookup
     -> Python: pre-invoke plugin hooks (if registered)
     -> Python: returns execution plan to Rust
  -> Rust: eligible?
     YES -> Rust applies modified args + headers from plan
            -> Rust calls upstream MCP server directly
            -> Rust: POST /_internal/mcp/tools/call/metric (Python)
     NO  -> Rust: POST /_internal/mcp/tools/call (Python)
            -> Python: full invoke_tool() with pre + post-invoke plugins
            -> Python calls upstream MCP server
```

### Plugin Handling by Mode

| Mode | Pre-invoke hooks | Post-invoke hooks | Tool execution |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `off` | Python (normal path) | Python (normal path) | Python |
| `shadow` | Python (normal path) | Python (normal path) | Python |
| `edge` | Python (via `/resolve` RPC) | Python (fallback only) | Rust direct when eligible, Python fallback otherwise |
| `full` | Python (via `/resolve` RPC) | Python (fallback only) | Rust direct when eligible, Python fallback otherwise |

Key behaviors:

- **Pre-invoke hooks** always run in Python. In `edge`/`full`, they execute
  during the `/resolve` call. Their output — modified arguments and injected
  headers — is returned in the execution plan for Rust to apply.
- **Post-invoke hooks** cannot run after Rust direct execution, so their
  presence forces an immediate fallback to the full Python path
  (`eligible: false`, `fallbackReason: post-invoke-hooks-configured`).
- **Plan caching** is disabled when pre-invoke hooks executed, because hook
  results may depend on per-call context (e.g. connection IDs, rotated
  credentials).

### Direct Execution Eligibility

A tool is eligible for Rust direct execution only when **all** of the
following are true:

- No post-invoke plugin hooks are registered
- No active observability trace
- Tool integration type is `MCP`
- Transport is `streamablehttp`
- No JSONPath filter configured on the tool
- No custom CA certificate on the gateway
- Gateway URL is present
- Gateway is not in `direct_proxy` mode
- OAuth grant type is not `authorization_code` (or token retrieval succeeds)
- Tool resolves unambiguously to a single enabled, reachable tool

When any condition fails, `prepare_rust_mcp_tool_execution()` returns
`eligible: false` with a `fallbackReason` string, and Rust forwards the
full request to the Python `/_internal/mcp/tools/call` endpoint.
