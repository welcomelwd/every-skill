# Middleware Execution Ordering

ContextForge uses Starlette's ASGI middleware stack to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, CSRF protection, logging, and observability. Understanding the execution order is critical when adding new middleware, especially when middleware depends on request state populated by other middleware.

## Reverse Registration Rule

**Starlette/FastAPI executes middleware in *reverse* registration order.** The last `app.add_middleware()` call registers middleware that runs *outermost* (processes requests first, responses last). The first `add_middleware()` call registers middleware that runs *innermost* (processes requests last, responses first).

### Worked Example

Suppose your code registers middleware like this:

```python
app.add_middleware(First)    # Registered first
app.add_middleware(Second)   # Registered second
app.add_middleware(Third)    # Registered third (last)
```

The execution order on an inbound request is:

```
Request  → Third → Second → First → Handler → First → Second → Third → Response
          (runs)  (runs)  (runs)             (done)  (done)  (done)
```

`Third` runs first on the request path (outermost), and `First` runs last (innermost, closest to the handler). On the response path, the order reverses.

This reverse-registration rule is a Starlette/FastAPI design decision. When a middleware reads `request.state` values set by another middleware, you must register the *producer* middleware **after** the *consumer* middleware so that the producer runs before (earlier on the request path than) the consumer.

## Current Middleware Stack

The middleware stack in `mcpgateway/main.py` (lines ~3265–3501) includes ~26 middleware, plus one outlier registered after route setup. The table below shows them in **registration order** (top = registered first, bottom = registered last). Per the [Reverse Registration Rule](#reverse-registration-rule) above, execution order on the request path is the *reverse* of this table — deriving an exact per-row execution rank by hand is error-prone (several rows are conditionally registered, which shifts everyone after them), so it is intentionally omitted here; see the prose sections below the table (state dependencies, the outlier) for the orderings that actually matter in practice, worked out and verified against `main.py` directly:

| Registration Order | Middleware | Purpose | Conditional |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CORSMiddleware` | Handles CORS preflight and cross-origin policy | Always |
| 2 | `SSEAwareCompressMiddleware` | Compresses responses (Brotli/Zstd/GZip), excludes SSE/MCP streams | `compression_enabled` |
| 3 | `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` | Adds CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, strips Server headers | Always |
| 4 | `HeaderSizeMiddleware` | Validates request header count/size (RFC 6585 §5) | `header_size_validation_enabled` |
| 5 | `RateLimitMiddleware` | Rate-limiting enforcement per IP/user tier | `rate_limiting_enabled` |
| 6 | `ValidationMiddleware` | Input validation and output sanitization | `validation_middleware_enabled` |
| 7 | `MCPProtocolVersionMiddleware` | Validates `MCP-Protocol-Version` header on MCP routes | Always |
| 8 | `BaseHTTPMiddleware` (token scoping) | Applies token scoping for email-auth users (data filtering) | `email_auth_enabled` |
| 9 | `MCPPathRewriteMiddleware` (token scoped) | Streamable HTTP for MCP routes with token scoping | `email_auth_enabled` |
| 10 | `MCPPathRewriteMiddleware` | Streamable HTTP for MCP routes (no scoping) | `NOT email_auth_enabled` |
| 11 | `HttpAuthMiddleware` | Plugin hook for HTTP auth (e.g., OAuth/OIDC) | Always |
| 12 | `RequestLoggingMiddleware` | Gateway boundary and detailed request/response logging | Always |
| 13 | `DocsAuthMiddleware` | Restricts `/docs` and `/redoc` to authenticated users | Always |
| 14 | `AdminAuthMiddleware` | Requires admin privilege for `/admin/*` routes | Always |
| 15 | `ForwardedHostMiddleware` | Rewrites `Host` from `X-Forwarded-Host` (proxy support) | Always |
| 16 | `ProxyHeadersMiddleware` | Trusts `X-Forwarded-*` headers (scheme, IP) | Always |
| 17 | `CorrelationIDMiddleware` | Attaches request correlation ID for tracing | `correlation_id_enabled` |
| 18 | `CSRFMiddleware` | CSRF token validation (state-changing requests) | `csrf_enabled` |
| 19 | `PasswordChangeEnforcementMiddleware` | Redirects users requiring password change (admin-only) | `password_change_enforcement_enabled` |
| 20 | `AuthContextMiddleware` | Extracts and validates JWT/session, sets `request.state.user` | `security_logging_enabled` OR `siem_export_enabled` with "auth" events OR `mcpgateway_admin_api_enabled` OR `password_change_enforcement_enabled` |
| 21 | `TokenUsageMiddleware` | Logs token usage for analytics/audit | `token_usage_logging_enabled` |
| 22 | `ObservabilityMiddleware` | Traces request spans for observability | `observability_enabled` |
| 23 | `OpenTelemetryRequestMiddleware` | OTEL request root span | `otel_tracing_enabled()` |
| 24 | `BaggageMiddleware` | OTEL baggage extraction from headers | `otel_baggage_enabled` AND `otel_tracing_enabled()` |
| 25 | `DBQueryLoggingMiddleware` | Logs database queries for N+1 detection | `db_query_log_enabled` |
| 26 | `ClientDisconnectMiddleware` | Cancels in-flight handlers on client disconnect | `client_disconnect_middleware_enabled` |
| **27 (outlier)** | **`DeprecationHeadersMiddleware`** | **Adds RFC 8594 Sunset/Link headers to legacy routes** | **`legacy_api_enabled`** |

Row 27 is the one row whose execution position is unambiguous and worth calling out here: it is registered *after* everything else (see [The Outlier](#the-outlier-deprecationheadersmiddleware) below), which per the reverse-registration rule makes it the **outermost** middleware in the stack — it runs first on the request path, ahead of even `CORSMiddleware` (row 1).

Rows 18–20 (`CSRFMiddleware`, `PasswordChangeEnforcementMiddleware`, `AuthContextMiddleware`) are registered in that order, so among just those three, `AuthContextMiddleware` — registered *last* of the three — is the **outermost of the three** and runs *first* among them on the request path, populating `request.state.user` before `CSRFMiddleware` or `PasswordChangeEnforcementMiddleware` execute. That is the intended, correct behavior; see [State Dependencies](#state-dependencies-the-csrf-auth-middleware-ordering-bug) below. Note that `AuthContextMiddleware` is *not* registered last in the main block overall — `TokenUsageMiddleware`, `ObservabilityMiddleware`, `OpenTelemetryRequestMiddleware`, `BaggageMiddleware`, `DBQueryLoggingMiddleware`, and `ClientDisconnectMiddleware` (rows 21–26) are all registered after it, so it is not the innermost middleware overall either.

### The Outlier: `DeprecationHeadersMiddleware`

**Key point:** `DeprecationHeadersMiddleware` is registered **outside the main middleware block**, after `app.include_router(legacy_router)` (line ~12882). Because it is registered last, it runs **outermost** — ahead of everything in the main 3265–3501 registration block, including `CORSMiddleware`.

If you are adding middleware that depends on early request processing (e.g., extracting headers or setting flags), `DeprecationHeadersMiddleware` may already have run if `legacy_api_enabled=true`. If you add middleware after `DeprecationHeadersMiddleware`, it will run *before* `DeprecationHeadersMiddleware`, which is usually not desired.

## State Dependencies: The CSRF + Auth Middleware Ordering Bug

**Critical constraint:** `CSRFMiddleware` must be registered *before* `AuthContextMiddleware` so that CSRF runs *after* auth and `request.state.user` is already populated.

### The Bug (Issue #5780)

`CSRFMiddleware` validates HMAC-bound CSRF tokens using `request.state.user.email`:

```python
# mcpgateway/middleware/csrf_middleware.py:143–146
if hasattr(request.state, "user") and request.state.user:
    user = request.state.user
    user_id = user.email if hasattr(user, "email") else str(user.id)
```

`AuthContextMiddleware` populates `request.state.user` for all authenticated requests:

```python
# mcpgateway/middleware/auth_middleware.py:189
request.state.user = user
```

**If the middleware registration order is reversed** (CSRF registered after auth), then CSRF runs *before* auth on the request path, and `request.state.user` is unset. The CSRF middleware then silently falls back to extracting identity from the raw JWT `sub` claim (the user's ID, not email). But `admin.py` binds CSRF tokens to the user's *email*, not ID — resulting in universal 403 "CSRF Token Invalid" errors on all Admin UI writes.

**Solution:** In `main.py`, register `CSRFMiddleware` (line ~3403) *before* `AuthContextMiddleware` (line ~3427) so that the reverse-order execution makes auth run first on requests.

## Same-Shape Constraint: `PasswordChangeEnforcementMiddleware`

`PasswordChangeEnforcementMiddleware` has an identical dependency structure to `CSRFMiddleware`: it reads `request.state.user` to check the `password_change_required` flag (line ~96 in `password_change_enforcement.py`):

```python
user: Optional[EmailUser] = getattr(request.state, "user", None)
if not user:
    return await call_next(request)
```

For the same reason, `PasswordChangeEnforcementMiddleware` must be registered *before* `AuthContextMiddleware`. In the current codebase, both CSRF and PasswordChangeEnforcement are registered in the same order-dependent block (lines ~3403–3427), with both registered before auth.

If you add another middleware that reads `request.state` values set by `AuthContextMiddleware`, ensure it is registered *before* `AuthContextMiddleware` to preserve execution order.

## Guidance for Adding New Middleware

1. **Identify producers and consumers.** List the `request.state` attributes your middleware reads and writes. Identify which other middleware or dependencies populate those attributes.

2. **Register consumers *before* producers.** Middleware that reads `request.state.user`, `request.state.jti`, or other auth context must be registered *before* (earlier in the registration list than) `AuthContextMiddleware`.

3. **Add a regression test.** Write a test similar to `test_csrf_middleware_runs_after_auth_context_middleware` (in `tests/unit/mcpgateway/middleware/test_admin_csrf_binding.py:325`) to verify your middleware runs in the expected order:

   ```python
   def test_my_middleware_runs_after_auth_context_middleware():
       from mcpgateway.main import app
       from mcpgateway.middleware.auth_middleware import AuthContextMiddleware
       from mcpgateway.middleware.my_new_middleware import MyNewMiddleware

       middleware_classes = [m.cls for m in app.user_middleware]
       assert AuthContextMiddleware in middleware_classes
       assert MyNewMiddleware in middleware_classes

       auth_index = middleware_classes.index(AuthContextMiddleware)
       my_index = middleware_classes.index(MyNewMiddleware)

       # AuthContextMiddleware must run BEFORE MyNewMiddleware
       # (lower index means earlier in request processing)
       assert auth_index < my_index
   ```

4. **Consider the reverse-registration rule.** `add_middleware()` calls at the *end* register middleware that runs *first* on requests. When adding new middleware, reference this page (`docs/docs/architecture/middleware-ordering.md`) in the code comment next to your `app.add_middleware()` call to document your ordering rationale.

5. **Avoid brittle line-number references.** When documenting middleware order in code or docs, reference the middleware class name and its high-level purpose (e.g., "registered before AuthContextMiddleware") rather than specific line numbers, since the codebase evolves.
