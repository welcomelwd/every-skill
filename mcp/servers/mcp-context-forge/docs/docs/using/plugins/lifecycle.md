# Plugin Lifecycle

The plugin framework includes CLI tools to help you create, test, and deploy your plugins.

## Development Flow

The plugin development workflow  follows a straightforward workflow that gets you from idea to running plugin quickly.

```mermaid
graph LR

    A["template"]
    B(["$> bootstrap"])
    C(["$> build"])
    D(["$> serve"])

    subgraph dev
        A -.-> B
    end

    subgraph deploy
        C --> D
    end

    B --> C

    subgraph CF["ContextForge"]
        E["gateway"]
        D o--"MCP<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>tools/call <i>hook</i></small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--o E
    end

    style A stroke-dasharray: 3 3;
```

The process breaks down into these main steps:

- **Bootstrap**: Start with a plugin template and run the bootstrap command to set up your project structure
- **Build**: Compile and package your plugin code
- **Serve**: Launch a local development server to test your plugin
- **Connect**: Your served plugin automatically integrates with ContextForge's gateway via MCP (Model Context Protocol), using tool calls over standardized hooks for seamless communication

This streamlined approach lets developers focus on building functionality rather than wrestling with configuration, while ensuring plugins work smoothly within the broader ContextForge ecosystem.

### Bootstrap

Creating a new plugin for ContextForge only takes a few minutes!

Using the `mcpplugins` tool (installed with ContextForge),

```bash
mcpplugins bootstrap --destination your/plugin/dir
```

The interactive prompt you guide you to enter plugin metadata, and will boostrap a complete plugin project for you including everything you need to kick the tires writing your new plugin.

For a full list of options, check:

```bash
mcpplugins bootstrap --help
```

!!! tip
        When prompted for the choosing the plugin type, select `external` to create standalone plugins (with their own lock files and dependency trees).
        Select `native` if you want to create a plugin that embeds and gets loaded directly into the gateway environment.


The examples under the `plugins` directory in the gateway repository serve as a guide of how to develop and test `native` plugins.

The following instructions apply to `external` plugins. First, change directory to work with your newly bootstrapped plugin:

```bash
cd your/plugin/dir
cp .env.template .env
```

### Configuration

There are two main configuration files for your project.

```bash
./resources
    /plugins/config.yaml # configuration for your plugin and the plugin loader
    /runtime/config.yaml # configuration for the plugin server runtime
```

Inspect those two files and get familiar with them. There are many options you can customize, depending on your use case.

### Dependencies

Plugins are Python packages with dependencies managed by `uv`. Just like the gateway, you can add, lock, lint, and ensure that best practices are followed when creating your plugins. To install dependencies with dev packages (required for linting and testing), run:

```bash
make install-dev
```

Alternatively, you can also install it in editable mode:

```bash
make install-editable
```

### Test

To run all unit tests for your plugins:

```bash
make test
```

### Build

To build a container image (runtime) containing a standardized plugin server, run:

```bash
make build
```

### Serve

To start the plugin server:

```bash
make start
```

By default, this will start a Streamable HTTP MCP server on `http://localhost:8000/mcp`.

You can run `mcp inspector` to check your new server (note, it requires `npm`):

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

### Using gRPC Transport

For higher performance, you can use gRPC transport instead of MCP/HTTP. See the [gRPC Transport Guide](./grpc-transport.md) for details on performance comparisons.

#### Local Development with gRPC

```bash
# Install with gRPC support
make install-grpc

# Set transport to gRPC in .env
echo "PLUGINS_TRANSPORT=grpc" >> .env

# Start the server (defaults to port 50051)
./run-server.sh
```

#### Container Deployment with gRPC

To deploy your plugin container with gRPC transport:

```bash
# 1. Build the container with gRPC support
make build-grpc

# 2. Configure .env for gRPC
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
PLUGINS_TRANSPORT=grpc
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_PORT=50051
EOF

# 3. Start the container with gRPC port mapping
make start-grpc
```

Alternatively, you can manually specify the port:

```bash
make CONTAINER_PORT=50051 CONTAINER_INTERNAL_PORT=50051 start
```

#### Enabling mTLS for gRPC

To secure gRPC communication with mutual TLS:

```bash
# 1. Generate certificates (from the gateway directory)
make certs-mcp-ca                            # Generate CA
make certs-mcp-plugin PLUGIN_NAME=MyPlugin   # Generate plugin server cert

# 2. Copy certs to your plugin directory
mkdir -p certs/grpc
cp path/to/ca.pem certs/grpc/
cp path/to/server.pem certs/grpc/
cp path/to/server-key.pem certs/grpc/

# 3. Configure .env for mTLS
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
PLUGINS_TRANSPORT=grpc
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_PORT=50051
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_SSL_ENABLED=true
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_SSL_CERTFILE=certs/grpc/server.pem
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_SSL_KEYFILE=certs/grpc/server-key.pem
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_SSL_CA_CERTS=certs/grpc/ca.pem
PLUGINS_GRPC_SERVER_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH=require
EOF

# 4. Build and start with mTLS
make build-grpc
make start-grpc-tls   # Mounts certs/ into the container
```

The `start-grpc-tls` target automatically mounts the `certs/` directory into the container at `/opt/app-root/src/certs`.

For detailed TLS/mTLS configuration options, see the [gRPC Transport Guide](./grpc-transport.md#tlsmtls-configuration).

#### Container Deployment with Unix Socket Transport

For local high-performance deployments using Unix domain sockets:

```bash
# 1. Build the container with gRPC support (required for protobuf)
make build-grpc

# 2. Configure .env for Unix socket
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
PLUGINS_TRANSPORT=unix
PLUGINS_UNIX_SOCKET_PATH=/var/run/mcp-plugin.sock
EOF

# 3. Start with socket volume mount
docker run --name my-plugin \
    --env-file=.env \
    -v /var/run:/var/run \
    my-plugin:latest
```

## Plugin Templates

Plugin templates are bundled inside the [CPEX (ContextForge Plugin Extensions)](https://github.com/contextforge-org/contextforge-plugins-framework) package and are used automatically by the bootstrap command. Use the CLI to scaffold a new plugin project:

```bash
# Creates a new plugin from built-in CPEX templates, asks interactive prompts
mcpplugins bootstrap --destination your/plugin/dir

# Pass --type to select template directly
mcpplugins bootstrap --destination your/plugin/dir --type native   # or external
```

The built-in templates provide:

- **Native template**: Plugin class skeleton extending `Plugin`, manifest metadata, example config entry, and README.
- **External template**: Full project with plugin implementation skeleton, runtime config, `pyproject.toml`, `Containerfile`, `Makefile`, `run-server.sh`, and example tests.

After bootstrapping, follow the steps above to install deps, run tests, build, and serve.

## Gateway Integration

Let's assume you have boostrapped the following plugin (`resources/plugins/config.yaml`) with default runtime (`resources/runtime/config.yaml`) options:

```yaml
plugins:

  - name: "MyFilter"
    kind: "myfilter.plugin.MyFilter"
    description: "A filter plugin"
    version: "0.1.0"
    author: "Frederico Araujo"
    hooks: ["prompt_pre_fetch", "prompt_post_fetch", "tool_pre_invoke", "tool_post_invoke"]
    tags: ["plugin"]
    mode: "sequential"  # sequential | transform | disabled
    priority: 150
    conditions:
      # Apply to specific tools/servers
      - server_ids: []  # Apply to all servers
        tenant_ids: []  # Apply to all tenants
    config:
      # Plugin config dict passed to the plugin constructor

# Plugin directories to scan
plugin_dirs:

  - "myfilter"

# Global plugin settings
plugin_settings:
  parallel_execution_within_band: true
  plugin_timeout: 30
  fail_on_plugin_error: false
  enable_plugin_api: true
  plugin_health_check_interval: 60
```

For A2A tools, `TOOL_PRE_INVOKE` receives `payload.headers` with the non-sensitive request headers that pass the A2A agent's explicit `passthrough_headers` allowlist. When the field is unset or empty, no request headers are forwarded. Sensitive headers, such as `Authorization`, are not exposed to tool pre-invoke plugin payloads.

To integrate this plugin with the gateway, all you need to do is copying the following configuration under the `plugins` list in the gateway's `plugins/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  # External Filter Plugin
  - name: "MyFilter"
    kind: "external"
    priority: 10 # adjust the priority
    mcp:
      proto: STREAMABLEHTTP
      url: http://localhost:8000/mcp

To use Streamable HTTP over a Unix domain socket (no TCP port):

```yaml
plugins:

  - name: "MyFilter"
    kind: "external"
    priority: 10
    mcp:
      proto: STREAMABLEHTTP
      url: http://localhost/mcp
      uds: /var/run/mcp-plugin.sock
```
```

To use STDIO instead of HTTP:

```yaml
plugins:

  - name: "MyFilter"
    kind: "external"
    priority: 10
    mcp:
      proto: STDIO
      cmd: ["python", "path/to/your/plugin_server.py"]
      env:
        PLUGINS_CONFIG_PATH: "/opt/plugins/config.yaml"
      cwd: "/opt/plugins"
      # Relative script paths are resolved from cwd when provided
      # or: script: path/to/your/plugin_server.py  # .py/.sh or executable
```

Then, start the gateway:

```bash
make serve
```

!!! note
        `PLUGINS_ENABLED=true` should be set in your gateway `.env` file.

## Multi-Worker Execution

Under multiple workers (`GUNICORN_WORKERS`), every worker calls each plugin's
`initialize()`, so **hooks run on every worker by design**. A non-hook plugin
that does a **side effect** at startup or in a background task would otherwise
run it once per worker. Gate it with `is_primary_worker()` to run on one worker
per host:

```python
from mcpgateway.utils.primary_worker import is_primary_worker

class InventorySync(Plugin):
    async def initialize(self) -> None:
        if not is_primary_worker():
            return
        ...  # runs on one worker only
```

One worker is elected via a file lock; the OS frees it on process exit, so a
follower takes over. Re-check it each cycle for recurring work. The lock is per
host and its path is overridable with `PRIMARY_WORKER_LOCK_PATH`.

By default election is per host (`PRIMARY_WORKER_ELECTION_BACKEND=filelock`). For
a single primary across **multiple instances/replicas**, set the backend to
`redis`, which elects one primary across all instances sharing the same Redis
(best-effort under network partitions, so keep side effects idempotent).
