# AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET Rotation

`AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` is the key used to encrypt stored credentials in the
ContextForge database (OAuth tokens, SSO secrets, tool/agent/LLM auth values).
Unlike most configuration secrets — which take effect immediately on restart — rotating
`AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` requires a one-time re-encryption pass over the database
**before** the new key is used to start the gateway. This document covers how to do
that safely.

> ℹ️ For most other ContextForge secrets (e.g. `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`),
> rotation is as simple as updating the value in your config source and restarting the
> gateway. `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` is the exception because it protects data at rest.

> 🔼 **Upgrading to a new release and seeing a startup failure or auth errors?**
> You are in the right place. The sequence is: **run this rotation first, then start
> the new gateway version**. Do not start the new gateway before Step 5 is complete —
> doing so will make stored credentials permanently unreadable.

## What gets re-encrypted

The rotation script touches exactly these columns — everything else is untouched:

**EncryptionService path** (`v2:{...}` format — OAuth/SSO credentials):

| Table | Column(s) | Type |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `oauth_tokens` | `access_token`, `refresh_token` | Direct AES ciphertext |
| `registered_oauth_clients` | `client_secret_encrypted`, `registration_access_token_encrypted` | Direct AES ciphertext |
| `sso_providers` | `client_secret_encrypted` | Direct AES ciphertext |
| `gateways` | `oauth_config` | JSON — sensitive keys re-encrypted recursively |
| `a2a_server_auth` | `oauth_config` | JSON — sensitive keys re-encrypted recursively |
| `a2a_agent_auth` | `oauth_config` | JSON — sensitive keys re-encrypted recursively |

**services_auth path** (`base64url(nonce+ciphertext)` format — tool/agent/LLM credentials):

| Table | Column(s) | Type |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `tools` | `auth_value` | AES-GCM blob |
| `a2a_agents` | `auth_value`, `auth_query_params` | AES-GCM blob / JSON dict of blobs |
| `a2a_agent_auth` | `auth_value`, `auth_query_params` | AES-GCM blob / JSON dict of blobs |
| `gateways` | `auth_query_params` | JSON dict of AES-GCM blobs |
| `llm_providers` | `api_key` | AES-GCM blob |

Tables that don't exist (optional features not deployed) are silently skipped. NULL
values and plaintext values are also skipped. The script is **idempotent** — running
it twice is safe; already-rotated values are detected and skipped.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python environment with `uv` available (`uv --version`)
- Access to the configuration source your deployment reads from (`.env` file, Docker
  Compose environment block, Kubernetes Secret, Helm values, or your secret manager)
- Access to the database (`DATABASE_URL` — SQLite file path or PostgreSQL connection string)
- The current value of `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` — retrieve it **before** stopping

---

## Rotation sequence

### Step 0 — Back up the database and securely store the old key

#### Back up the database

> 💡 Using your own processes, create a backup of the database before making any
> changes. This is your safety net — if anything goes wrong during rotation you can
> restore and retry with the correct keys. Keep the backup until you have confirmed
> the rotated gateway starts and all OAuth / SSO / tool auth flows work correctly.

#### Securely store the old encryption key

Record the current value of `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` and store it securely (a
secrets manager, a password vault, or an encrypted note). You will need it as
`--old-key` in Step 5.

> ⚠️ Once Step 3 sets a new value, the old one is no longer in your config source.
> See the [Appendix](#appendix--deployment-specific-rotation-commands) for
> deployment-specific retrieval commands.

---

### Step 1 — Stop the ContextForge gateway

Stop the ContextForge gateway using whichever method your deployment uses, leaving
the database running. No writes must happen to the database between key generation
and rotation. See the [Appendix](#appendix--deployment-specific-rotation-commands)
for deployment-specific commands.

---

### Step 2 — Get the latest code or package

You need the codebase or package that contains the rotation script
(`mcpgateway/scripts/migrate_enc_secret.py`) available to run it.

> ⚠️ **If upgrading:** pull the new version's code or package now so you can run
> the rotation script. **Do not deploy or start the new gateway image/process yet** —
> that happens in Step 6, after the rotation is complete.

For git-based deployments: `git pull origin main` or check out your target version.
For Docker / Kubernetes / Helm: run the script from a local checkout or
`pip install --upgrade mcp-contextforge-gateway` on any machine that can reach the
database, before the new image is deployed.

---

### Step 3 — Generate a new strong key

Generate a strong new `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` (≥ 32 chars, high-entropy) and set it
in your config source. The value must be in place **before** you run Step 5 — the
script reads it as `--new-key`.

For repository-based deployments, `make init-secrets` generates a ready-to-use value
in `.env.secrets`. For package consumers or environments without `make`, generate one
with Python: `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`.

> 📋 Note the new value — you will pass it as `--new-key` in Step 5.
> See the [Appendix](#appendix--deployment-specific-rotation-commands) for how to
> set the value in each deployment type.

---

### Step 4 — Dry-run the rotation *(recommended)*

Reads every affected row and reports what would be re-encrypted. No writes are made.
This ensures that no unforeseen issues occur with rotating the encrypted data before
committing to the live run.

```bash
uv run python3 -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key <old-key> \
    --new-key <new-strong-key> \
    --dry-run
```

Expected output:

```
============================================================
DRY RUN SUMMARY (no changes written):
  Rows scanned  : 12
  Values migrated: 8
  Values skipped : 4
  Errors         : 0
============================================================
```

> ❌ **If `Errors > 0`:** some rows are encrypted with a key that is neither
> `--old-key` nor `--new-key` (a third key from a previous rotation). Stop and
> investigate before proceeding — do not run the live rotation until errors are 0.

---

### Step 5 — Run the live rotation

Re-encrypts all affected rows under the new key in a single database transaction.
The transaction is rolled back automatically if any row fails — the database is
always left in its original state on failure.

```bash
uv run python3 -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key <old-key> \
    --new-key <new-strong-key>
```

**Non-default database URL (PostgreSQL etc.):**

```bash
uv run python3 -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key <old-key> \
    --new-key <new-strong-key> \
    --database-url postgresql+psycopg://user:pass@host/dbname
```

**Environment variable fallback (useful in CI / secret managers):**

```bash
OLD_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=<old> \
NEW_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=<new> \
    uv run python3 -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret
```

Expected output on success:

```
============================================================
ROTATION SUMMARY:
  Rows scanned  : 12
  Values migrated: 8
  Values skipped : 4
  Errors         : 0
============================================================

✅  Rotation complete — 8 value(s) re-encrypted successfully.
```

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | All rows rotated (or nothing to rotate). Proceed to Step 6. |
| `1` | One or more rows failed. Transaction rolled back. Check stderr before retrying. |

---

### Step 6 — Start the ContextForge gateway

The guardrail now passes (strong key in your config) and all database rows are
encrypted under the new key. Start the gateway using whichever method your
deployment uses. See the [Appendix](#appendix--deployment-specific-rotation-commands)
for deployment-specific commands.

**Confirm everything is running as expected:** verify there is no
`SecurityConfigurationError` in the startup logs, then confirm SSO / OAuth flows,
tool auth, and agent credentials all work correctly before discarding the database
backup.

---

## Using ContextForge as a Python package

If you embed ContextForge in your own application via `pip install mcp-contextforge-gateway`
rather than running the server directly, the rotation script is still available as a
module and can be driven programmatically or from a plain `python` invocation — no
`uv`, `make`, or repository checkout required.

> 🔼 **Upgrading the package and seeing a startup failure or auth errors?**
> `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` is now required to be a strong secret (≥ 32 chars,
> high-entropy). If your application previously set a weak value, you must:
> 1. Generate a strong new key (Step 1 below).
> 2. Run the rotation script to re-encrypt stored credentials (Steps 2–3 below).
> 3. Update `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` to the new value in your config and restart.
>
> **Do not update the config and restart first** — the gateway will start but all
> stored credentials will be unreadable until the rotation script is run.

### Why this path is different

When installed as a package:

- `uv` and `make` are not available (they are dev tools, not runtime dependencies).
- The `.env` file convention does not apply — your application owns the configuration surface.
- You generate strong secrets with Python's `secrets` module rather than `make init-secrets`.
- The rotation script is invoked either as a CLI entry-point or imported directly.

### Step-by-step for package consumers

**1. Generate a strong new key in Python:**

```python
import secrets
new_key = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)   # 43-char URL-safe base64 string
print(new_key)
```

Store the output wherever your application reads `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` from —
an environment variable, a secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager,
IBM Key Protect), or an injected config file. Keep the old key available until
Step 3 completes.

**2. Dry-run via the installed entry-point:**

```bash
# If mcp-contextforge-gateway is installed in the active environment:
python -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key "$OLD_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET" \
    --new-key "$NEW_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET" \
    --database-url "$DATABASE_URL" \
    --dry-run
```

**3. Run the live rotation:**

```bash
python -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key "$OLD_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET" \
    --new-key "$NEW_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET" \
    --database-url "$DATABASE_URL"
```

**4. Invoke programmatically from your own code:**

```python
import sys
from mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret import main

sys.argv = [
    "migrate_enc_secret",
    "--old-key", old_key,
    "--new-key", new_key,
    "--database-url", database_url,
]
main()   # raises SystemExit(0) on success, SystemExit(1) on failure
```

Or, to capture the result without raising:

```python
import subprocess, sys

result = subprocess.run(
    [
        sys.executable, "-m", "mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret",
        "--old-key", old_key,
        "--new-key", new_key,
        "--database-url", database_url,
    ],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
)
if result.returncode != 0:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Secret rotation failed:\n{result.stderr}")
```

**5. Update your application config and restart:**

After a `returncode == 0`, update `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` to the new value in
whatever config surface your app uses, then restart the gateway process.

### Using environment variables instead of CLI flags

The script reads `OLD_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` and `NEW_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` from
the environment if the corresponding CLI flags are not passed — convenient when your
secrets manager injects environment variables at runtime:

```python
import os, subprocess, sys

os.environ["OLD_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET"] = old_key
os.environ["NEW_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET"] = new_key
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = database_url

result = subprocess.run(
    [sys.executable, "-m", "mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret"],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True,
)
```

> ⚠️ Clear `OLD_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET` from the environment after the rotation
> completes — it is a live credential.

---

## Special cases

### Never had any OAuth tokens / SSO / gateways with credentials

The dry-run will report `Rows scanned: 0, Values migrated: 0`. Still run the live
rotation (Step 5) to confirm exit 0, but it is a no-op. Steps 3 and 6 are the only
ones that matter for you.

### Helm / Kubernetes deployments

`charts/mcp-stack/values.yaml` ships with `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET: ""` (must be
set explicitly). Provide the new strong value via your `values-override.yaml` or a
Kubernetes Secret, then run the rotation as a pre-upgrade Job or init container
**before** the gateway Deployment rolls over to the new version.

### `MIN_SECRET_LENGTH` raised above 32

If you have `MIN_SECRET_LENGTH=64` set in your configuration, `make init-secrets` will
generate a token of ≥ 64 chars (the script respects the configured floor). Set that
full value in your config source and pass it as `--new-key`. The rotation script
validates `--new-key` against the absolute 32-char minimum only — the gateway will
re-apply the higher floor at startup.

### If you started the gateway with the wrong key

> ❌ **This is a data-loss scenario.** Any row written after the gateway started is
> encrypted under the new key. Any row still encrypted under the old key is now
> unreadable by the running gateway. You need to identify which rows each key owns
> before re-running the rotation. Use `--dry-run` with both key orders to see the
> error counts, then contact the team before proceeding.

### Rolling back to a previous (weaker) key — `--force`

> ⚠️ **Use only when you intentionally need to decrypt back to a key that does not
> meet the strength requirements** (e.g. reverting a key rotation in a test
> environment, or undoing a rotation before re-doing it with a different key).
> After a `--force` rollback the database will contain credentials encrypted under a
> weak key — the gateway will refuse to start until a strong key is in place.

By default the script rejects `--new-key` values that are too short, known-weak, or
low-entropy — the same guardrail the gateway enforces at startup. Pass `--force` to
bypass all three checks:

```bash
# Roll back from a strong key to a previously-used weak key
uv run python3 -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key <current-strong-key> \
    --new-key <previous-weak-key> \
    --force

# Re-encrypt in the opposite direction again (back to strong) — --force not needed
uv run python3 -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key <previous-weak-key> \
    --new-key <current-strong-key>
```

`--force` also works when **both** keys are weak (e.g. re-keying between two legacy
short keys):

```bash
uv run python3 -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key <weak-key-a> \
    --new-key <weak-key-b> \
    --force
```

A warning is always printed to stderr when `--force` is active:

```
⚠️   --force: new-key strength validation skipped
```

`--force` can be combined with `--dry-run` to preview what would be re-encrypted
before committing:

```bash
uv run python3 -m mcpgateway.scripts.migrate_enc_secret \
    --old-key <strong-key> \
    --new-key <weak-key> \
    --force \
    --dry-run
```

## Troubleshooting

| Error message | Cause | Fix |
|---------------|-------|-----|
| `SecurityConfigurationError: auth_encryption_secret: too short` | Gateway started before generating a strong key | Stop gateway. Run Step 3, then Step 5, then restart. |
| `❌ --new-key is too short` | Weak value passed as `--new-key` | Generate a strong value (see Step 3), pass it as `--new-key`. Or pass `--force` if a weak target key is intentional (rollback scenario). |
| `❌ --old-key and --new-key are identical` | Both arguments have the same value | Verify you are using the old key as `--old-key` and the newly generated value as `--new-key`. |
| `Errors: N` in dry-run output | Some rows encrypted with a third key | Identify previous key rotation history; re-run with the correct `--old-key` for each batch. |
| `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET: shell environment holds a weak/non-compliant value…` | `AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=changeme` exported in shell, strong value already in `.env` | Run `unset AUTH_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, then retry. |
| OAuth flows break after rotation | Rotation ran with wrong `--old-key`; rows not actually re-encrypted | Confirm exit code was `0` and `Values migrated > 0`. Re-run rotation with correct keys. |
| Tool / agent / LLM auth fails after rotation | `services_auth` blobs not re-encrypted (separate path from OAuth) | Same fix — re-run rotation with correct `--old-key`; confirm `Values migrated > 0` for those tables. |
