Password Change Enforcement Middleware.

This middleware enforces mandatory password changes for users with the
password_change_required flag set. It prevents bypassing the password
change requirement by directly navigating to admin routes.

Security Design:
- Only enforces on /admin/* routes (scoped to admin UI)
- Exempts password change and logout endpoints
- Only applies to session tokens (not API tokens)
- Runs after authentication (has access to user context)
