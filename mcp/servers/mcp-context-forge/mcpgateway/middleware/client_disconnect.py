Client Disconnect Middleware.

Pure ASGI middleware that detects when a client (e.g., nginx reverse proxy)
closes the connection and cancels the in-flight request handler. This triggers
cleanup of all resources held by the request (DB sessions via get_db's finally
block, HTTP client connections, etc.).

Without this middleware, when nginx's proxy_read_timeout fires (e.g., 60s),
it sends FIN to the gateway but the handler keeps running — the socket enters
CLOSE_WAIT and all request memory (ORM objects, response buffers) is retained
until the handler eventually finishes. Under sustained load this causes a
death spiral: slow requests → nginx timeouts → CLOSE_WAIT accumulation →
OOM → swap thrashing → even slower requests.

This middleware breaks the cycle by cancelling the handler as soon as the
ASGI server signals disconnect, allowing finally blocks to release resources.
