Forwarded Host Middleware.

Rewrites the ASGI ``host`` header and ``scope["server"]`` tuple from the
``X-Forwarded-Host`` header set by a reverse proxy.

Uvicorn's ``ProxyHeadersMiddleware`` handles ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` (scheme)
and ``X-Forwarded-For`` (client IP) but does **not** handle
``X-Forwarded-Host`` (upstream issue encode/uvicorn#965, open PR #2811).

This middleware fills that gap so that ``request.base_url`` (used in admin UI
hints, OAuth redirect_uri display, well-known URLs, etc.) reflects the
proxy's public host rather than the gateway's internal address.

Starlette builds ``request.base_url`` from the ``host`` header, not from
``scope["server"]``.  The host header rewrite is therefore the critical
change; ``scope["server"]`` is updated as well for other ASGI consumers.

Register this middleware **before** ``ProxyHeadersMiddleware`` in the
``add_middleware`` stack (which means it is inner / executes **after**
``ProxyHeadersMiddleware`` in the ASGI call chain, ensuring the scheme is
already corrected when we derive the default port for ``scope["server"]``).

Trust decisions (which upstream IPs may set forwarded headers) are the
responsibility of the caller — this middleware always acts when
``X-Forwarded-Host`` is present.  The gateway should only register it
when proxy headers are trusted (the same condition under which
``ProxyHeadersMiddleware`` is registered).

When Uvicorn merges upstream support, this middleware can be removed.
