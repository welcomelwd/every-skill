Shared root-path resolution utility for ContextForge.

Some embedded/proxy deployments do not populate ``scope["root_path"]``
consistently.  This module provides a single canonical helper that checks
the ASGI scope first and falls back to ``settings.app_root_path`` when the
scope value is empty — the same logic that was previously private to
``mcpgateway/admin.py`` (issue #3298).

All call sites that previously read ``request.scope.get("root_path", "")``
directly should use :func:`resolve_root_path` instead.

def resolve_root_path(request: Request, *, fallback: str | None = None) -> str:
    """Resolve the application root path from the request scope with fallback.

    Checks ``request.scope["root_path"]`` first; when that is absent or empty
    falls back to ``settings.app_root_path`` (or *fallback* when explicitly
    supplied).  The returned value is normalised: a leading ``/`` is added when
    the path is non-empty, and any trailing ``/`` is stripped.

    Values containing control characters, URL scheme markers, or query/fragment
    delimiters are sanitised to an empty string (with a warning log) to prevent
    header-injection and open-redirect attacks without crashing the request
    pipeline.

    Args:
        request: Incoming ASGI request whose scope is inspected. Should not be none.
        fallback: Optional explicit fallback string.  When *None* (default)
            ``settings.app_root_path`` is used as the fallback.

    Returns:
        Normalised root path (leading ``/``, no trailing ``/``), or an empty
        string when no root path is configured or the value was rejected.

        >>> from unittest.mock import MagicMock
