Shared admin detection helper used by Layer-1 visibility filters.

This module is the **single source of truth** for answering "is this email
an admin for the purpose of visibility bypass?" at the service layer.

IMPORTANT security semantics:

- The auth layer (``mcpgateway/auth.py``) is the authority on whether an admin
  has been granted un-narrowed scope.  Callers MUST gate invocation of
  :func:`is_user_admin` on ``token_teams is None`` — i.e., only consult the
  DB when the token-scoping layer has already said "this caller is
  unrestricted".  Calling :func:`is_user_admin` for a caller whose token is
  narrowed (``token_teams == []`` or ``["t1", ...]``) and granting bypass on
  the result violates the contract in
  :func:`mcpgateway.auth.normalize_token_teams` that public-only and
  team-scoped tokens narrow even admins.  See AGENTS.md / #4106.

- The helper is **fail-closed**: any exception from the DB lookup returns
  ``False``.

- Results are memoized on ``db.info`` for the lifetime of the SQLAlchemy
  session, so list operations and per-entity access checks do not pay for
  repeated admin lookups.  The cache is keyed by ``user_email`` and scoped
  to a single Session — it does not persist across requests.

def is_user_admin(db: Optional[Session], user_email: Optional[str]) -> bool:
    """Return ``True`` if the given email identifies an admin user.

    Performs two checks in order:

    1. Match against ``settings.platform_admin_email`` (no DB round-trip).
    2. Look up ``EmailUser`` row and check ``is_admin is True``.

    Results are cached on ``db.info[_ADMIN_CACHE_KEY]`` for the lifetime of
    the session to avoid N+1 lookups during list operations or loops.

    Args:
        db: Active SQLAlchemy session.  ``None`` returns ``False`` after
            the platform-admin fast-path — the DB check cannot run without
            a session (fail-closed).
        user_email: Email to test.  ``None`` or empty returns ``False``
            immediately (no identity → no admin).

    Returns:
        ``True`` if the user is a platform admin or has ``is_admin=True``
        in the database; ``False`` otherwise (including on DB errors or a
        ``None`` session, matching the fail-closed policy required by
        AGENTS.md).

    Caller contract:
        Callers MUST gate this on ``token_teams is None`` — see module
        docstring.  Calling ``is_user_admin`` for a narrowed token and
        acting on the result reintroduces the bypass regression guarded
        against in PR #4107.

    """Return ``True`` when the caller should receive Layer-1 admin bypass.

    This is the single place the "does this caller bypass visibility
    filtering?" question is answered.  Encodes the full security contract
    so callers don't replicate the ``token_teams is None`` guard that
    prevents the #4106 regression.

    Bypass applies in exactly two cases:

    1. ``token_teams is None and user_email is None`` — no auth context,
       pre-auth admin or a fully unscoped call.
    2. ``token_teams is None and user_email`` is set and the user is an
       admin in the DB — the auth layer resolved an admin session.

    Narrowed tokens (``token_teams == []`` or ``token_teams == ["t1", ...]``)
    **never** grant bypass, even for DB admins.  This matches the contract
    in :func:`mcpgateway.auth.normalize_token_teams` that public-only and
    team-scoped tokens constrain all callers.

    Args:
        db: Active SQLAlchemy session; may be ``None``.  The DB lookup
            fails closed (False) when the session is missing.
        user_email: Caller email, or ``None``.
        token_teams: Token team scope from
            :func:`mcpgateway.auth.normalize_token_teams` /
            :func:`mcpgateway.auth.resolve_session_teams`.  ``None`` means
            the auth layer granted unrestricted access; ``[]`` means
            public-only; a non-empty list means team-scoped.

    Returns:
        ``True`` when the caller should see all rows; ``False`` when the
        caller must be constrained by normal visibility rules.
