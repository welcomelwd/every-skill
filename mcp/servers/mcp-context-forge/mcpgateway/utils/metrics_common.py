    Convert database query results to TopPerformer objects.

    This utility function eliminates code duplication across service modules
    that need to convert database query results with metrics into TopPerformer objects.

    Args:
        results: List of database query results, each containing:
            - id: Entity ID
            - name: Entity name
            - execution_count: Total executions
            - avg_response_time: Average response time
            - success_rate: Success rate percentage
            - last_execution: Last execution timestamp

    Returns:
        List[TopPerformer]: List of TopPerformer objects with proper type conversions

    Examples:
        >>> from unittest.mock import MagicMock
        >>> result = MagicMock()
        >>> result.id = 1
        >>> result.name = "test"
        >>> result.execution_count = 10
        >>> result.avg_response_time = 1.5
        >>> result.success_rate = 85.0
        >>> result.last_execution = None
        >>> performers = build_top_performers([result])
        >>> len(performers)
        1
        >>> performers[0].id
        1
        >>> performers[0].execution_count
        10
        >>> performers[0].avg_response_time
        1.5
