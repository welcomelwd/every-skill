Primary-worker election for side-effecting plugin work.

Under multiple worker processes every worker runs each plugin's
``initialize()``. ``is_primary_worker()`` lets a plugin gate side-effecting work
to one worker. Two backends, selected by ``PRIMARY_WORKER_ELECTION_BACKEND``:

- ``filelock`` (default): one primary per host. The first process to acquire the
  lock is primary; the OS releases it on exit so another caller can take over.
- ``redis``: one primary across all instances sharing a Redis (see
  ``mcpgateway.services.leader_election``).

The file lock is per host. Its path defaults to a port-scoped temp file,
overridable via ``PRIMARY_WORKER_LOCK_PATH``. The path is predictable in a
world-writable temp dir, so a local process could pre-acquire it and block
election — point the setting at a gateway-owned directory on hostile hosts.
