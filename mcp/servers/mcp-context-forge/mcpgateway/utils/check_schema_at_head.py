CLI: exit 0 iff the database schema is at the Alembic script-directory head.

Used as the gateway pod's startup-probe command in the Helm chart so that
pods refuse Ready until the schema has been migrated — regardless of which
migration runner did the work (Helm pre/post-install Job, init container,
external CD pipeline, manual operator step).

Exits:
    0  schema is at head
    1  schema is missing, mismatched, or any error encountered

Usage::

    python3 -m mcpgateway.utils.check_schema_at_head
