Server-to-client event bus for the MCP GET /mcp stream (ADR-052).
Backs the spec-defined "Listening for messages from the server" SSE stream.
Server-initiated JSON-RPC messages (notifications and requests) are
``publish``-ed by whichever worker holds the upstream MCP session and
``subscribe``-d by the GET /mcp handler on whichever node the client landed.
Two interchangeable backends sit behind ``ServerEventBus``:
* ``RedisServerEventBus`` (selected when ``cache_type == "redis"``) — durable
  per-session ring buffer via :class:`RedisEventStore` + Pub/Sub fanout on
  ``mcp:session:{sid}:events`` so any node can serve the stream.
* ``InMemoryServerEventBus`` (default) — process-local ring buffer with
  ``asyncio.Queue`` per subscriber. Single-process semantics are identical
  to Redis for one process; cross-worker delivery is intentionally absent
  because that is a multi-node concern.
The factory ``get_server_event_bus()`` reads ``cache_type`` once at first
call and binds the singleton; switching backends requires a restart.

        atomically (no other client command executes during a script),
