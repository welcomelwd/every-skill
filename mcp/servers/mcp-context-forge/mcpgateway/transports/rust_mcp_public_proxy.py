nginx-style reverse proxy to the Rust MCP public listener.

Use this when the gateway is the only public ingress (no nginx in front)
but you still want public ``/mcp`` traffic to bypass Python's transport
on the hot path. Routes to ``MCP_RUST_PUBLIC_LISTEN_HTTP`` (Rust's
authenticated public endpoint), not the trusted-internal
``MCP_RUST_LISTEN_HTTP`` that ``RustMCPRuntimeProxy`` uses.

Differences from ``RustMCPRuntimeProxy``
(``mcpgateway/transports/rust_mcp_runtime_proxy.py``):

- Forwards to the **public** listener (Rust calls back into Python for
  auth via ``/_internal/mcp/authenticate``), not the trusted-internal
  listener that assumes Python pre-authenticated.
- Adds ``X-Forwarded-{For,Proto,Host}``, RFC 7239 ``Forwarded``, and
  ``X-Real-IP`` — nginx-style — so Rust's auth path sees the original
  client info instead of ``127.0.0.1``.
- Preserves ``Authorization``, ``Cookie``, MCP session headers — this is
  a public hop, not a trusted-internal one.
- Does NOT inject ``x-contextforge-mcp-runtime``,
  ``X-ContextForge-Auth-Context``, or any other trust-marker headers.
- Streams both directions without buffering (SSE-friendly).

Registered with ``MCPIngressMount`` under the name ``"rust-public"``;
the selector picks it when ``settings.mcp_rust_ingress == "public"``.
