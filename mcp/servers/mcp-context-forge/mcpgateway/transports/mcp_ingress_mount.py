Swappable mount point for the public ``/mcp`` ingress.

The mount itself owns no routing policy. It holds a registry of named
ingress ASGI apps and a callable that returns the name of whichever one
should serve the current request. Adding a new ingress (rust-public-proxy,
shadow-comparison, percentage-traffic-split, …) is a one-line
``register()`` call; selection policy is one function.

This replaces the role of the prior ``MCPStreamableHTTPModeDispatcher``
(which was hard-coded to a Python transport plus a single Rust transport,
with the per-request choice baked into its ``handle_streamable_http``
method). See
``docs/docs/architecture/adr/051-swappable-mcp-ingress-mount.md`` for
the design decision and migration notes.

    Lifecycle:
      1. Construct with a selector and (optionally) a fallback ingress.
      2. Register every ingress this build supports.
      3. Mount once at /mcp via ``app.mount("/mcp", mount.dispatch)``.
      4. Add/replace ingresses or swap the selector at runtime; the mount
         picks them up on the next request.

    Concurrency: ingress lookup is a single dict read on the request hot
    path, no locks. Registration writes are not synchronized — the
    assumption is that ingresses are registered at startup and changed
    only via admin actions that already go through their own coordination
    (e.g. the runtime override coordinator). If you need atomic policy
    swaps mid-flight, swap the selector via :meth:`set_selector` rather
    than rewriting registrations.

    Drain semantics: an ingress that owns long-lived connections (SSE,
    chunked POST) keeps serving them even after it is unregistered or
    selected away from. The next request just routes to the new ingress.
    This matches the prior dispatcher's "natural drain" property.
