Alembic environment configuration for database migrations.
This module configures the Alembic migration environment for ContextForge
application. It sets up both offline and online migration modes, configures
logging, and establishes the database connection parameters.

The module performs the following key functions:
- Configures Alembic to locate migration scripts in the mcpgateway package
- Sets up Python logging based on the alembic.ini configuration
- Imports the SQLAlchemy metadata from the application models
- Configures the database URL from application settings
- Provides functions for running migrations in both offline and online modes

Offline mode generates SQL scripts without connecting to the database, while
online mode executes migrations directly against a live database connection.

Attributes:
    config (Config): The Alembic configuration object loaded from alembic.ini.
    target_metadata (MetaData): SQLAlchemy metadata object containing all
        table definitions from the application models.

Examples:
    Running migrations in offline mode::

        alembic upgrade head --sql

    Running migrations in online mode::

        alembic upgrade head

    The module is typically not imported directly but is used by Alembic
    when executing migration commands.

Note:
    This file is automatically executed by Alembic and should not be
    imported or run directly by application code.

# Standard
from importlib.resources import files
import logging
from logging.config import fileConfig

# Third-Party
from alembic import context

# this is the Alembic Config object, which provides
# access to the values within the .ini file in use.
from alembic.config import Config
from sqlalchemy import engine_from_config, pool

# NOTE: mcpgateway.config (Settings) and mcpgateway.db (Base) are imported
# lazily inside the functions below.  Importing them at module level would
# trigger Settings() construction — and therefore validate_security_combinations
# — every time alembic loads env.py, including `alembic current`, `alembic
# heads`, and `alembic upgrade head --sql`, even on a fresh checkout that has
# not yet had secrets configured.  Deferred imports confine that side-effect to
# the moment migrations actually run.


# Create config object - this is the standard way in Alembic

def _inside_alembic() -> bool:
    """Detect if this module is being executed by the Alembic CLI.

    This function checks whether the current execution context is within
    an Alembic migration environment. It's used to prevent migration code
    from running when this module is imported for other purposes (e.g.,
    during testing or when importing models).

    The detection works by checking for the presence of the '_proxy' attribute
    on the alembic.context object. This attribute is set internally by Alembic
    when it loads and executes the env.py file during migration operations.

    Returns:
        bool: True if running under Alembic CLI (e.g., during 'alembic upgrade',
            'alembic downgrade', etc.), False if imported normally by Python
            code or during testing.

    Examples:
        >>> # Normal import context (no _proxy attribute)
        >>> import types
        >>> fake_context = types.SimpleNamespace()
        >>> import mcpgateway.alembic.env as env_module
        >>> original_context = env_module.context
        >>> env_module.context = fake_context
        >>> env_module._inside_alembic()
        False

        >>> # Simulated Alembic context (with _proxy attribute)
        >>> fake_context._proxy = True
        >>> env_module._inside_alembic()
        True

        >>> # Restore original context
        >>> env_module.context = original_context

    Note:
        This guard is crucial to prevent the migration execution code at the
        bottom of this module from running during normal imports. Without it,
        importing this module would attempt to run migrations every time.
