Update role permissions and assign default roles to existing users.

Revision ID: v1a2b3c4d5e6
Revises: 04cda6733305
Create Date: 2026-02-04 12:30:00.000000

This migration:
1. Updates permissions for team_admin, developer, and viewer roles
2. Creates platform_viewer role with global scope
3. Assigns roles to existing users:
   - Admin users: team_admin (team scope) + platform_admin (global scope)
   - Non-admin users: team_admin (team scope) + platform_viewer (global scope)
   - Preserves platform admin records unchanged

This ensures backward compatibility when RBAC is enabled on an existing system.
