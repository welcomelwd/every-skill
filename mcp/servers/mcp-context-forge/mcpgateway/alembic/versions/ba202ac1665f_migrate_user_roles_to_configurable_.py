Migrate user roles to configurable defaults

Revision ID: ba202ac1665f
Revises: a31c6ffc2239
Create Date: 2026-02-13 16:43:04.089267

Migrate existing user_roles assignments to use the configurable default role
names from settings. If settings match the previous hardcoded defaults, this
migration is a no-op.

Previous hardcoded defaults:
  - Admin global role: platform_admin
  - User global role: platform_viewer
  - Team owner role: team_admin
  - Team member role: viewer

Configurable via:
  - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
  - DEFAULT_USER_ROLE
  - DEFAULT_TEAM_OWNER_ROLE
  - DEFAULT_TEAM_MEMBER_ROLE
