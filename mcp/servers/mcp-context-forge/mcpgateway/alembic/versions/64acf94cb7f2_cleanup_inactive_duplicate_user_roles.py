cleanup_inactive_duplicate_user_roles

Revision ID: 64acf94cb7f2
Revises: a3c38b6c2437
Create Date: 2026-03-13 10:07:53.737721

Remove inactive duplicate user_role rows where an active row exists for the
same (user_email, role_id, scope, scope_id) tuple. Fixes #3505.

This migration is idempotent and safe to run multiple times.
Handles both SQLite and PostgreSQL with dialect-specific SQL.
