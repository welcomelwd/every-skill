    """
    Check if a specific unique constraint exists on a given table.

    This function queries the database using the provided SQLAlchemy
    inspector to determine if a constraint with the given name exists.
    If the check fails due to an exception (e.g., database connectivity issues),
    it conservatively assumes that the constraint exists.

    Args:
        inspector (sqlalchemy.engine.reflection.Inspector): SQLAlchemy inspector
            instance for database introspection.
        table_name (str): Name of the table to inspect.
        constraint_name (str): Name of the unique constraint to check.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the constraint exists or if the check could not be performed,
              False if the constraint does not exist.
