normalize_registered_oauth_client_issuer

Revision ID: 4e6273136e56
Revises: f1a2b3c4d5e6
Create Date: 2026-01-25 01:32:38.987891

This migration normalizes the `issuer` column in `registered_oauth_clients` table
by stripping trailing slashes. This ensures consistent lookup and prevents duplicate
registrations when the MCP SDK adds trailing slashes via Pydantic's AnyHttpUrl.

See: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/issues/1919
