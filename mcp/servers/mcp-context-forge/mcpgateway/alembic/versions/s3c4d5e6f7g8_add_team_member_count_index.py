Add partial index for team member count queries

Revision ID: s3c4d5e6f7g8
Revises: r2b3c4d5e6f7
Create Date: 2026-01-04

This migration adds a partial index on email_team_members to optimize the
batch member count queries used by get_member_counts_batch(). The index
covers the WHERE is_active = true condition used in those queries.

For PostgreSQL, this uses a partial index which is most efficient.
For SQLite, a composite index is used as partial indexes are not supported.
