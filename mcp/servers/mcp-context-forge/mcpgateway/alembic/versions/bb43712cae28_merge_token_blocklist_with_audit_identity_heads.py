merge token_blocklist (PR #4371) with audit-identity main head

Revision ID: bb43712cae28
Revises: cae28b15a507, b2c3d4e5f6g7
Create Date: 2026-04-26 16:30:00.000000

Resolves the dual-head condition introduced when PR #4371 (#4317) was rebased
onto a main branch that had advanced past d2b501bf4262 (the head referenced by
cae28b15a507_merge_token_revocation_and_uaid_heads.py). After this migration
`alembic heads` returns a single head again.
