Authentication primitives: JWT, sessions, API tokens, and team membership.

Purpose (for future implementers)
---------------------------------
``mcpgateway`` separates authentication concerns into two modules:

- ``mcpgateway.auth`` (this module) - the **token / session / team model
  layer**. Helpers here operate on stored artifacts: JWT payloads, session
  records, API tokens, revocation records, and team-membership rows. They
  return DB-shaped or dict results and never take a FastAPI ``Request``.
  Because they are pure in that sense, they can be reused from any context
  (tests, background tasks, transport hops, RBAC middleware).

- ``mcpgateway.auth_context`` - the **per-request resolution layer**. Helpers
  there take a FastAPI ``Request`` plus the ``user`` produced by the auth
  dependency and compute what the caller is allowed to see on this request
  (Layer 1 visibility context). See ``auth_context.py`` for its purpose block
  and the ``AGENTS.md`` "Authentication & RBAC Overview" section for the
  two-layer policy model.

Rule of thumb
-------------
- Input is a ``Request``? -> belongs in ``auth_context.py``.
- Input is a JWT payload, user email, token hash, or team ID? -> belongs here.

Public surface
--------------
The names below form this module's stable public API. ``main.py``, routers,
transports, middleware, and tests all consume them.

    User and session resolution
        get_current_user(...) - FastAPI dependency
        get_user_team_roles(db, email) -> dict[team_id, role]

    Token claim normalization (canonical per AGENTS.md)
        normalize_token_teams(payload) -> list[str] | None
        resolve_session_teams(...) -> list[str] | None

Private-but-cross-module surface
--------------------------------
A few leading-underscore helpers are intentionally imported by other modules
for a specific reason: they are the **synchronous variants** of async DB
lookups, wrapped in ``asyncio.to_thread`` by callers in FastAPI hot paths.
The underscore is a convention marker that says "prefer the async wrapper;
if you must go sync, use this one" - not a "don't import" signal. The
callers (``main.py``, ``transports/streamablehttp_transport.py``,
``utils/verify_credentials.py``) all follow the same ``asyncio.to_thread``
pattern.

    _check_token_revoked_sync(jti) -> bool
    _lookup_api_token_sync(token_hash) -> dict | None

If you are tempted to import any other underscore-prefixed name from this
module, stop and ask whether the caller should really go through a public
wrapper or whether the helper genuinely deserves promotion to the public API.
