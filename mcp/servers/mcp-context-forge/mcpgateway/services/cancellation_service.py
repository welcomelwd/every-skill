Service for tracking and cancelling active tool runs.

Provides a simple in-memory registry for run metadata and an optional async
cancel callback that can be invoked when a cancellation is requested. This
service is intentionally small and designed to be a single-process helper for
local run lifecycle management; the gateway remains authoritative for
cancellation and also broadcasts a `notifications/cancelled` JSON-RPC
notification to connected sessions.
