Description:
    Centralized handler for MCP server-to-gateway notifications AND the
    server-to-client fanout surface introduced by ADR-052 (GET /mcp stream).
    Connects upstream ``ClientSession`` message-handler callbacks to the
    per-session event bus and to the worker-local request-correlation dict
    that lets downstream POSTs resolve held ``RequestResponder`` instances.

    Responsibilities:
    - Debounced gateway refresh triggered by ``tools/resources/prompts
      list_changed`` notifications (with flag merging during the debounce
      window, per-gateway refresh lock, capability-aware filtering).
    - ``ServerNotification`` fanout to the GET /mcp event bus so
      downstream clients on the SSE stream see the notification.
    - ``ServerRequest`` correlation (``_forward_request_to_stream`` +
      ``complete_request``) for sampling / elicitation / roots-list —
      registers the responder under ``(session_id, request_id)``, spawns
      a holder task, publishes the envelope, and waits for a downstream
      POST to resolve it. Timeout is per-task via ``wait_for``; there is
      no background sweeper.
    - Bounded ``shutdown`` that drains holder tasks within a configurable
      timeout and cancels any stragglers.

Usage:
    ```python
    from mcpgateway.services.notification_service import NotificationService

    # Create service instance
    notification_service = NotificationService()
    await notification_service.initialize()

    # Create a message handler for a specific gateway
    handler = notification_service.create_message_handler(gateway_id="gw-123")

    # Pass handler to ClientSession
    session = ClientSession(read_stream, write_stream, message_handler=handler)
    ```
