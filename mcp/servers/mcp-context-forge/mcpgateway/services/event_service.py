Description:
    This module implements a Centralized Event Service designed to decouple event
    producers from consumers within ContextForge architecture for various services
    such as gateway_service, tool_service, and more.

    - Primary Transport (Redis): Uses Redis Pub/Sub for distributed event
      broadcasting. This allows multiple Gateway instances (scaled horizontally)
      to share events.
    - Fallback Transport (Local Queue): Uses `asyncio.Queue` for in-memory
      communication. This activates automatically if Redis is unavailable or
      misconfigured, ensuring the application remains functional in a single-node
      development environment.

Usage Guide:

    1. Initialization
       Instantiate the service with a unique channel name. This acts as the "Topic".

       ```python
       from mcpgateway.services.event_service import EventService

       # Create a service instance for tool execution events
       tool_events = EventService(channel_name="mcpgateway:tools")
       ```

    2. Publishing Events (Producer)
       Any part of the application can publish a dictionary to the channel.

       ```python
       await tool_events.publish_event({
           "event": "tool_start",
           "tool_name": "calculator",
           "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
       })
       ```

    3. Subscribing to Events (Consumer)
       Use an async for-loop to listen to the stream. This generator yields
       events as they arrive.

       ```python
       async for event in tool_events.subscribe_events():
           print(f"Received event: {event['event']}")
           # Process event...
       ```
