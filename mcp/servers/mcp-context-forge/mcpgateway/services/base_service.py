        Handles the full access-control flow for list endpoints:
        1. Admin bypass: anonymous (user_email=None AND token_teams=None) sees
           public + team rows only. DB-resolved admin (email provided) sees
           public + team rows + their OWN private rows, except when token_teams=[],
           where Layer 1 token scoping suppresses owner access even for admin users.
           No bypass shape exposes another user's private rows (PR #4341 /
           issue #4323). The DB-resolved admin shape is detected via
           :func:`~mcpgateway.utils.admin_check.is_user_admin` — using the broader
           ``is_admin_bypass_granted`` here would risk re-introducing the leak this
           PR closes (see PR #4341 review B2/B5).
        2. Resolves effective teams from JWT token_teams or DB lookup.
        3. Suppresses owner matching for public-only tokens (token_teams=[]) for
           all users (Layer 1 token scoping).
        4. Delegates to _apply_visibility_filter for SQL WHERE construction.

        Args:
            query: SQLAlchemy query to filter.
            db: Database session (for team membership lookup when token_teams is None).
            user_email: User's email. ``None`` = no user context.
            token_teams: Teams from JWT via normalize_token_teams() or resolve_session_teams().
                ``None`` = admin bypass (API token) or no auth context.
                ``[]`` = public-only token.
                ``[...]`` = team-scoped token (API or session token).
