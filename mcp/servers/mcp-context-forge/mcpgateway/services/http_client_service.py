Shared HTTP Client Service.

This module provides a singleton httpx.AsyncClient that is shared across all
services in ContextForge. Using a shared client instead of per-request clients
provides significant performance benefits:

- Connection reuse: Avoids TCP handshake and TLS negotiation per request
- Connection pooling: Manages concurrent connections efficiently
- Configurable limits: Prevents connection exhaustion under high load

Performance benchmarks show ~20x throughput improvement vs per-request clients.

Usage:
    from mcpgateway.services.http_client_service import get_http_client

    # Get the shared client for making requests
    client = await get_http_client()
    response = await client.get("https://example.com/api")

    # For requests needing isolated TLS/auth context (rare):
    async with get_isolated_http_client(verify=custom_ssl_context) as client:
        response = await client.get("https://example.com/api")

Configuration (environment variables):
    HTTPX_MAX_CONNECTIONS: Maximum concurrent connections (default: 200)
    HTTPX_MAX_KEEPALIVE_CONNECTIONS: Idle connections to retain (default: 100)
    HTTPX_KEEPALIVE_EXPIRY: Idle connection timeout in seconds (default: 30)
    HTTPX_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: Connection timeout in seconds (default: 5)
    HTTPX_READ_TIMEOUT: Read timeout in seconds (default: 120, high for slow MCP tools)
    HTTPX_WRITE_TIMEOUT: Write timeout in seconds (default: 30)
    HTTPX_POOL_TIMEOUT: Pool wait timeout in seconds (default: 10)
    HTTPX_HTTP2_ENABLED: Enable HTTP/2 (default: false)
    HTTPX_ADMIN_READ_TIMEOUT: Read timeout for admin operations (default: 30)
