#
# S4 bounds (untrusted plugin output). These are deliberately conservative,
# defensible defaults -- not a contract mandated by any single plugin:
#   - plugin_name and metric keys must match _IDENTIFIER_RE (bounded length,
#     restricted charset) before they're allowed to flow into DB span/metric
#     names, resource ids, or OTel span/attribute names -- these are
#     plugin-controlled and otherwise unvalidated.
#   - Only scalar values (str, int, float, bool) are recorded as-is; strings
#     must additionally have a field name in the explicit _SAFE_STRING_FIELD_NAMES
#     allowlist and be within _MAX_STRING_LENGTH and match _SAFE_STRING_VALUE_RE
#     (a low-cardinality, no-free-text charset). The charset alone bounds size and
#     character set, not semantic sensitivity -- a short SSN- or token-shaped value
#     (e.g. "123-45-6789") is charset-valid, so string values are deny-by-default
#     and only accepted for field names known in advance to carry non-sensitive
#     enum/status/type data. Overlong values are rejected outright, not truncated --
#     truncation alone would bound size but not the sensitivity of what's exported
#     (e.g. a truncated secret/token fragment is still a secret/token fragment).
#   - Numeric (int/float, excluding bool) values are subject to the same
#     deny-by-default field-name allowlist (_SAFE_NUMERIC_FIELD_NAMES): a field
#     name valid as an identifier is not proof it's non-sensitive -- {"ssn":
#     123456789} or {"account_id": 123456789012} would otherwise sail through
#     under any plugin-chosen key. Only fields known in advance to carry
#     non-sensitive counters (e.g. total_detections, total_masked) are accepted,
#     and the value must additionally be a finite number (NaN/inf rejected).
#   - A list[str] value (e.g. ["email", "ssn"]) is special-cased: joined into
#     a single comma-separated string (OTel span attributes don't nest), then
#     subject to the same field-name-allowlisted string-value validation as any
#     other string value.
#   - Any other type (dict, mixed/non-str list, None, etc.) is dropped.
#   - At most _MAX_PLUGIN_KEYS keys survive per plugin's metadata dict, and
#     only the first _MAX_PLUGIN_KEYS items of the raw dict are ever inspected
#     (via itertools.islice) -- not just accepted -- so a huge untrusted dict,
#     even one front-loaded with invalid keys, can't force a full scan.
#   - At most _MAX_PLUGINS_PER_CALL plugin namespaces are processed per call
#     (result.metadata can in principle carry entries from every plugin that
#     ran in the hook chain); the cap is applied before the full item list is
#     materialized.
#   - list[str] values are only checked for str-ness and per-item length
#     within the first _MAX_LIST_ITEMS items, so an oversized untrusted list
#     can't force a full scan or an unbounded join before it's bounded.
# On drop, only the key name and a short reason are logged -- never the value
# itself, since it may be malformed/oversized/adversarial plugin output.

    For each ``result_metadata[<plugin>]`` entry, validates the value (S4 -- see module docstring

      - Primary: attaches the validated key/value pairs as attributes on a small, dedicated,
        short-lived span (``plugin.metrics.<plugin_name>``) rooted at the active trace. This
        span exists purely to carry the attributes -- it does not represent real work -- because
        by the time this function runs, both the hook-chain span (owned by the CPEX framework)
        and any per-call-site span have typically already been closed, so there is no live span
        left to attach attributes to in place. All spans created for a single call to this
        function share one DB session (P-3 batching): ``start_span``/``end_span`` both accept an
        external ``obs_db`` session, so the whole primary path commits once.
      - Secondary (optional): for each *numeric* (``int``/``float``, excluding ``bool``) validated
        field, also records an ``ObservabilityMetric`` row via ``record_metric()`` so plugin
        counters (e.g. ``total_detections``) are queryable as metrics, not just span attributes.
        ``record_metric()`` does not accept an external session (unlike start_span/end_span), so
        each call opens its own independent short-lived session -- this mirrors the existing
        "issue #3883" independent-session pattern used throughout ``ObservabilityService`` and is
        an accepted, documented limitation of batching this secondary path.

    This is deliberately best-effort (L4): it must never raise into the request path. Any
    unexpected failure (missing trace, DB error, malformed plugin metadata, etc.) is logged at
    debug level and swallowed. No-op if ``trace_id`` or ``result_metadata`` is falsy/absent.

    Collision behaviour (two source keys map to the same destination):
    The last source key processed wins — ``dict`` assignment overwrites the
    earlier value silently.  This is documented deterministic behaviour: since
    exact rules are evaluated first and wildcard rules are evaluated in
    insertion order, the outcome is predictable.  Compile-time collision
    detection (rejecting ambiguous configs at startup) is planned for the

    destination, empty key, key > 256 chars), the function returns the
    attributes **unchanged** rather than applying a partially-validated
