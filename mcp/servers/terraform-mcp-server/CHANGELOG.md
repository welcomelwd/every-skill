# 1.3.0

FEATURES

* [New Tool] `whoami` Returns the identity of the currently authenticated Terraform token. Reports the username, email, and whether the token belongs to a service account (team or organization token) or a real user.
* [New Tool] `list_teams` Lists all teams within a given Terraform Cloud organization. Requires `terraform_org_name`. Optionally filter by exact team names (`team_names`), or substring search (`search_query`). Supports pagination.
* [New Tool] `get_team` Fetches full details for a single team by ID, including members, organization access permissions, and SSO settings. Requires `team_id`. [441](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/441)
* [New Tool] `get_project` Fetches detailed information about a Terraform project by its ID. Requires `project_id`.
* [New Tool] `create_team` Creates a new team in a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise organization. Requires `terraform_org_name` and `team_name`; optional `visibility` ("secret" or "organization"). [427](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/427)
* [New Tool] `add_team_member` Adds a single member to a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise team. Requires `team_id`; accepts either `username` (accepted-invite users only) or `organization_membership_id` (works for pending and accepted invites). Exactly one must be provided.
* [New Tool] `grant_team_access` Grants a team access to a workspace or project by ID. Requires `team_id`, `access_level`, and either `workspace_id` or `project_id` (mutually exclusive). Valid access levels for workspaces: `admin`, `read`, `write`, `plan`, `custom`. Valid access levels for projects: `admin`, `read`, `write`, `maintain`, `custom`.
* [New Tool] `delete_team` Permanently deletes a Terraform team by its `team_id`. Requires `team_id` (e.g. `team-abc123def456`). This is a destructive operation and must set `ENABLE_TF_OPERATIONS=true`.

FIXES

* `get_apply_logs` now checks the apply status before attempting to stream logs. If the apply is not yet in a terminal state (`finished`, `errored`, `canceled`), the tool returns an informative message instead of timing out.

# 1.2.0

FEATURES

* [New Tool] `list_state_versions` Lists all state versions for a given workspace. Requires `terraform_org_name` and `workspace_name`; supports optional pagination params.
* [New Tool] `get_state_version` Retrieves a Terraform state version. If `state_version_id` is provided, retrieves that specific state version. Otherwise, retrieves the latest state version for the specified `workspace_id`. One of `state_version_id` or `workspace_id` must be provided.
* [New Tool] `get_run_comments` Lists all discussion comments associated with a given Terraform run. Requires `run_id`.
* [New Tool] `create_project` Creates a new Terraform project in the specified organization. Requires `terraform_org_name` and `project_name`. [420](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/420)
* [New Tool] `delete_project` Deletes a Terraform project by ID. Requires `project_id`. TFC/TFE will refuse to delete a project that still contains workspaces or stacks. [420](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/420)

IMPROVEMENTS

* Extend the existing HTTP-layer `OrganizationAllowlistMiddleware` with a new MCP tool-layer `OrganizationAllowlistToolMiddleware` that rejects tool calls whose `terraform_org_name` argument is not in the allowlist configured via `MCP_ORGANIZATION_ALLOWLIST`. [430](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/430)
* Add `version` field to the `/health` endpoint response to make it easier to identify which version is deployed at a glance. [410](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/410)
* Add optional Instana instrumentation (metrics and HTTP request tracing) for the streamable-http server, gated behind `INSTANA_ENABLED` [411](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/411)
* Add `TF_MCP_SHARED_SECRET` to send an `X-Tf-Mcp-Secret` header on requests to HCP Terraform / TFE, allowing the backend to identify requests from a trusted MCP deployment [392](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/392)

FIXES

* Ensure all logs are output in JSON format when `LOG_FORMAT=json` is set in streamable HTTP mode. [402](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/402)

# 1.1.0

FIXES

* Ensure organization allowlist validation and downstream Terraform API requests use the same Authorization bearer token, preventing a conflicting `TFE_TOKEN` header from bypassing the allowlist. [396](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/396)
* Disable client-supplied `TFE_ADDRESS` in streamable-http mode. Previously a client could override the Terraform address via HTTP header or query parameter, redirecting the server's requests and Authorization bearer token to an arbitrary endpoint. The address must now be configured server-side via the `TFE_ADDRESS` env var. This is a breaking change: clients supplying the address via header or query parameter now receive a 403. [389](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/389)
* Fix http server not serving TLS when configured [391](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/391)
* Make client IP sourcing configurable and fix insecure X-Forwarded-For handling. The server previously trusted the leftmost `X-Forwarded-For` value,had no IPv6 support, and did not validate IPs. Sourcing is now configurable via `MCP_REMOTE_IP_METHOD` (`RemoteAddr`, `X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`) and `MCP_XFF_TRUSTED_HOPS`, defaulting to the secure `RemoteAddr`. This is a breaking change: proxy deployments relying on automatic `X-Forwarded-For` forwarding must now set `MCP_REMOTE_IP_METHOD=X-Forwarded-For` and `MCP_XFF_TRUSTED_HOPS`. [388](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/388)
* Fix security vulnerabilities for cross-tenant HCP Terraform token reuse in stateless HTTP mode (multi-tenant token bleed), session-scoped TFE client cache bypassing per-token request validation in StreamableHTTP mode and cleaning up at end of session [395](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/pull/395)

FEATURES

* [New Tool] `force_unlock_workspace` Force unlocks a Terraform workspace stuck in a run-held lock. Requires workspace admin permissions and is gated behind `ENABLE_TF_OPERATIONS=true`
* [Configuration] Add a `MCP_REDIRECT_ROOT_URL` environment variable to allow redirecting `/` of the server when visited in-browser.

* **Individual Tools Flag**: Added `--tools` flag to enable specific tools by name for fine-grained control. Accepts comma-separated list of tool names with validation and security checks.
* Added `get_token_permissions` tool to allow listing permissions for current token.
