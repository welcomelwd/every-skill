## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are a **Microsoft employee** then please also review our [Azure Internal Onboarding Documentation](https://aka.ms/azmcp/intake) for getting setup

### Prerequisites

1. **VS Code**: Install either [stable](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) release
2. **GitHub Copilot**: Install [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) extensions
3. **Node.js**: Install latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version (ensure `node` and `npm` are in your PATH)
4. **PowerShell**: Install [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) 7.0 or later (required for build and test scripts)

### Central NuGet Feed

This repository uses a single Azure DevOps package feed for all NuGet packages instead of nuget.org directly. The feed is configured in `nuget.config`.

The feed has an **upstream** configured to nuget.org. When an authenticated user restores a package that is not yet cached in the feed, it is automatically ingested from nuget.org. Unauthenticated users can only consume package versions that have already been ingested into the feed.

You can browse the feed directly at: <https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-net>

#### Installing the Azure Artifacts Credential Provider

To authenticate with the feed you need the **Azure Artifacts Credential Provider**:

1. Install it from <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099625> (you can also find this link by clicking **Connect to Feed** from the feed page above).
2. Once installed, the first `dotnet restore` (or any command with an implicit restore) will trigger an authentication prompt.
3. Valid Users of the Azure DevOps project will be authenticated as a **Collaborator** on the feed, which allows you to:
   - Pull any package already in the feed.
   - Trigger the feed to query nuget.org and ingest new packages or versions that are not yet present.

The feed is **public**, so anyone can read packages that are already cached. The credential provider is only needed to cause new packages to be ingested from the upstream.

#### External Contributors

External contributors will not be able to authenticate to the feed as **Collaborator**, but our Pull Request pipeline can. External contributors should temporarily add nuget.org as an additional source in `nuget.config` to build locally with new packages, then revert that `nuget.config` change before submitting their pull request. Our pipeline will authenticate to the feed, ingest the new package, and build normally.

If you need local-only NuGet configuration for development, use a user-level `NuGet.Config` and a temporary `--configfile` rather than editing this repository's tracked `nuget.config`. Do not commit local feed changes to the repo.

Do not assume the Pull Request pipeline will always ingest a missing package automatically. Upstream ingestion can fail or be delayed. If your PR depends on a package/version that is not yet visible in the feed, ask a maintainer or Microsoft contributor to pre-ingest it by restoring against the feed first, then retry once the package appears in <https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-net>.

## Development Workflow

### Development Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Write or update tests
5. Test locally
6. Submit a pull request

### Adding a New Command

> [!TIP]
> **Submit One Tool Per Pull Request**
>
> We strongly recommend submitting **one tool per pull request** to streamline the review process and provide better onboarding experience. This approach results in:
>
> - **Faster reviews**: Single tools are easier and quicker to review
> - **Better feedback**: More focused discussions on individual tool implementation
> - **Easier iteration**: Smaller changes mean faster iteration cycles
> - **Incremental progress**: Get your first tool merged to establish baseline, then build upon it
>
> If you're planning to contribute multiple tools, please:
>
> 1. Submit your most important or representative tool as your first PR to establish the code patterns.
> 2. Use that baseline to inform your subsequent tool PRs.

1. **Create an issue** with title: "Add command: azmcp [namespace] [resource] [operation]" and detailed description

2. **Set up development environment**:
   - Open VS Code Insiders
   - Open the Copilot Chat view
   - Select "Agent" mode

3. **Generate the command** using Copilot:

   ```txt
   Execute in Copilot Chat:
   "create [namespace] [resource] [operation] command using /skills/add-azure-mcp-tools as a reference"
   ```

4. **Follow implementation guidelines** in [.github/skills/add-azure-mcp-tools/SKILL.md](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/.github/skills/add-azure-mcp-tools/SKILL.md)

5. **Update documentation**:
   - Add the new command to [/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/docs/azmcp-commands.md](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/docs/azmcp-commands.md)
   - Run `.\eng\scripts\Update-AzCommandsMetadata.ps1` to update tool metadata in azmcp-commands.md (required for CI)
   - Add test prompts for the new command in [/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/docs/e2eTestPrompts.md](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/docs/e2eTestPrompts.md)
   - Update [README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/README.md) to mention the new command

6. **Create a changelog entry** (if your change is a new feature, bug fix, or breaking change):
   - Use the generator script to create a changelog entry (see `docs/changelog-entries.md` for details):
     ```powershell
     # Interactive mode (prompts for server)
     ./eng/scripts/New-ChangelogEntry.ps1
     
     # Or with all parameters
     ./eng/scripts/New-ChangelogEntry.ps1 -ChangelogPath "servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/CHANGELOG.md" -Description <your-change-description> -Section <changelog-section> -PR <pr-number>
     ./eng/scripts/New-ChangelogEntry.ps1 -ChangelogPath "servers/Fabric.Mcp.Server/CHANGELOG.md" -Description <your-change-description> -Section <changelog-section> -PR <pr-number>
     ```
   - Or manually create a YAML file in `servers/{ServerName}/changelog-entries/`
   - Not every PR needs a changelog entry - skip for internal refactoring, test-only changes, or minor updates. If unsure, add to the "Other Changes" section or ask a maintainer.

7. **Add CODEOWNERS entry** in [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) [(example)](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/commit/08f73efe826d5d47c0f93be5ed9e614740e82091)

8. **Add new tool to consolidated mode**:
   - Open `core/Azure.Mcp.Core/src/Areas/Server/Resources/consolidated-tools.json` file, where the tool grouping definition is stored for consolidated mode. In Agent mode, add it to the chat as context.
   - Paste the follow prompt for Copilot to generate the change to add the new tool:
      ```txt
      I have this list of tools which haven't been matched with any consolidated tools in this file. Help me add them to the one with the best matching category and exact matching toolMetadata. Update existing consolidated tools where newly mapped tools are added. If you can't find one, suggest a new consolidated tool.

      <Add new tool name here>
      ```
   - Use the following command to find out the correct tool name for your new tool
      ```
      cd servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0
      ./azmcp[.exe] tools list --name --namespace <tool_area>
      ```
   - Commit the change.

9. **Create Pull Request**:
   - Reference the issue you created
   - Include tests in the `/tests` folder
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Follow code style requirements
   - Run [`ToolDescriptionEvaluator`](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/eng/tools/ToolDescriptionEvaluator/Quickstart.md) for the new tool description and obtain a score of `0.4` or more and a top 3 ranking for all related test prompts

## Testing

Command authors must provide unit tests and end-to-end test prompts. Commands that interact with Azure resources **must** also include live tests with recorded playback coverage (see [Recording Live Tests](#recording-live-tests)).

### Unit Tests

Unit tests live under the `/tests` folder. To run tests:

```pwsh
./eng/scripts/Test-Code.ps1
```

To scope the test run to path substring matches, use:

```pwsh
./eng/scripts/Test-Code.ps1 -Paths KeyVault, core/Azure
```

Requirements:

- Each command should have unit tests
  - The command unit tests should extend `CommandUnitTestsBase<TCommand, TService>`
- Tests should cover success and error scenarios
- Mock external service calls
- Test argument validation

#### Cancellation plumbing

To ensure the product code and unit tests can be cancelled quickly, contributors are required to write async methods (any returning `Task`, `ValueTask`, generic variants of those, etc.) to accept and invoke async methods with a `System.Threading.CancellationToken` parameter. The latter is enforced with the [CA2016 analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2016).

Mocks created with `NSubstitute.Substitute.For<T>()` and have [methods set up](https://nsubstitute.github.io/help/set-return-value/#for-methods) should be passed `NSubstitute.Arg.Any<CancellationToken>()` for required `System.Threading.CancellationToken` parameters. The same should be used when [checking for received calls on a mocked object](https://nsubstitute.github.io/help/received-calls/index.html). If the product code is expected to do something interesting with a supplied `System.Threading.CancellationToken` parameter, such as linking with other `System.Threading.CancellationToken`s with [`System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.threading.cancellationtokensource.createlinkedtokensource), then consider testing for that behavior.

Real product code under unit testing must be passed `Xunit.TestContext.Current.CancellationToken` when async methods are invoked. This is to ensure the tests can end to avoid possible issues with the parent process waiting indefinitely for the test runner executable to exit.

### End-to-end Tests

End-to-end tests are performed manually. Command authors must thoroughly test each command to ensure correct tool invocation and results. At least one prompt per tool is required and should be added to the server's `/server/<servername>/docs/e2eTestPrompts.md` file.

### Running evals with vally

vally is the evaluation framework used to test the performance/accuracy of Azure MCP server and its tools. See [`/docs/testing-with-vally.md`](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/docs/testing-with-vally.md).

### Testing Local Build with VS Code

To run the Azure MCP server from source for local development:

#### Build the Server

Build the project at the root directory of this repository:

```bash
dotnet build
```

#### Run the Azure MCP server in HTTP mode

**Option 1: Using dotnet run (uses launchSettings.json)**

**Prerequisites: Create launchSettings.json**

> [!NOTE]
> Internal contributors may skip this step as the `launchSettings.json` file is already provided in the repository.

Before running the server in HTTP mode, you need to create the `launchSettings.json` file with the `debug-remotemcp` profile:

1. Create the directory (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/Properties
   ```

2. Create `servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/Properties/launchSettings.json` with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "profiles": {
       "debug-remotemcp": {
         "commandName": "Project",
         "commandLineArgs": "server start --transport http --outgoing-auth-strategy UseHostingEnvironmentIdentity",
         "environmentVariables": {
           "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
           "ASPNETCORE_URLS": "http://localhost:<port>",
           "AzureAd__TenantId": "<your-tenant-id>",
           "AzureAd__ClientId": "<your-client-id>",
           "AzureAd__Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Replace `<your-tenant-id>` and `<your-client-id>` with your actual tenant ID and client ID.

```bash
dotnet run --project servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/ --launch-profile debug-remotemcp
```

**Option 2: Using the built executable directly**

Build the project first, then run the executable with the necessary environment variables:

```powershell
# Set environment variables (PowerShell)
$env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Development"
$env:ASPNETCORE_URLS = "http://localhost:<port>"
$env:AzureAd__TenantId = "<your-tenant-id>"
$env:AzureAd__ClientId = "<your-client-id>"
$env:AzureAd__Instance = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"

# Run the executable
./servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp.exe server start --transport http --outgoing-auth-strategy UseHostingEnvironmentIdentity
```

```bash
# Set environment variables (Bash)
export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT="Development"
export ASPNETCORE_URLS="http://localhost:<port>"
export AzureAd__TenantId="<your-tenant-id>"
export AzureAd__ClientId="<your-client-id>"
export AzureAd__Instance="https://login.microsoftonline.com/"

# Run the executable
./servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp server start --transport http --outgoing-auth-strategy UseHostingEnvironmentIdentity
```

> **Note:** The environment variables listed above are taken from the `debug-remotemcp` profile in `launchSettings.json`. Replace `<your-tenant-id>` and `<your-client-id>` with your actual Azure AD tenant ID and client ID. These variables configure Azure AD authentication and the server endpoint for HTTP mode operation.
>
> For local development, when running with HTTPS (either via `ASPNETCORE_URLS` or HTTPS redirection), you must generate a self-signed development certificate:
>
>**Windows and macOS:**
> ```bash
> dotnet dev-certs https --trust
> ```
>
> **Linux:**
> ```bash
> dotnet dev-certs https
> ```
>
> On Linux, you must manually trust the generated certificate. See the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-dev-certs) for instructions on how to do this.

#### Configure mcp.json

Update your mcp.json to point to the locally built azmcp executable.

**Stdio Mode:**

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<absolute-path-to>/mcp/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp[.exe]",
      "args": ["server", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

**HTTP Mode:**

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Azure MCP Server": {
      "url": "https://localhost:1031/",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> For stdio mode, replace `<absolute-path-to>` with the full path to your built executable.
> On **Windows**, use `azmcp.exe`. On **macOS/Linux**, use `azmcp`.
> For HTTP mode, ensure the server is running on the specified port before connecting (port 1031 is the default port configured in launchSettings.json).

#### Server Modes

Optional `--namespace` and `--mode` parameters can be used to configure different server modes:

**Default Mode** (no additional parameters):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<absolute-path-to>/mcp/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp[.exe]",
      "args": ["server", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Namespace Mode** (expose specific services):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<absolute-path-to>/mcp/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp[.exe]",
      "args": ["server", "start", "--namespace", "storage", "--namespace", "keyvault"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Namespace Proxy Mode** (collapse tools by namespace):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<absolute-path-to>/mcp/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp[.exe]",
      "args": ["server", "start", "--mode", "namespace"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Single Tool Proxy Mode** (single "azure" tool with internal routing):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<absolute-path-to>/mcp/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp[.exe]",
      "args": ["server", "start", "--mode", "single"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Consolidated Mode** (grouped related operations):
It honors both --read-only and --namespace switches.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<absolute-path-to>/mcp/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp[.exe]",
      "args": ["server", "start", "--mode", "consolidated"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Combined Mode** (filter namespaces with any mode):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<absolute-path-to>/mcp/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp[.exe]",
      "args": ["server", "start", "--namespace", "storage", "--namespace", "keyvault", "--mode", "namespace"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Specific Tool Mode** (expose only specific tools):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-mcp-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "<absolute-path-to>/mcp/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/bin/Debug/net10.0/azmcp[.exe]",
      "args": ["server", "start", "--tool", "azmcp_storage_account_get", "--tool", "azmcp_subscription_list"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Server Mode Summary:**
>
> - **Default Mode (Namespace)**: No additional parameters - collapses tools by namespace (current default)
> - **Consolidated Mode**: `--mode consolidated` - exposes consolidated tools grouping related operations, optimized for AI agents.
> - **Namespace Mode**: `--namespace <service-name>` - expose specific services
> - **Namespace Proxy Mode**: `--mode namespace` - collapse tools by namespace (useful for VS Code's 128 tool limit)
> - **All Tools Mode**: `--mode all` - expose all ~800+ individual tools
> - **Single Tool Mode**: `--mode single` - single "azure" tool with internal routing
> - **Specific Tool Mode**: `--tool <tool-name>` - expose only specific tools by name (finest granularity)
> - **Combined Mode**: Multiple options can be used together (`--namespace` + `--mode` etc.)

#### Start from IDE

With the configuration in place, you can launch the MCP server directly from your IDE or any tooling that uses `mcp.json`.

### Testing Local Build with Docker

To build a local image for testing purposes:

1. Execute: `./eng/scripts/Build-Docker.ps1 -ServerName "Azure.Mcp.Server"`.
2. Update `mcp.json` to point to locally built Docker image:

    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "Azure MCP Server": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "--env-file",
            "/full/path/to/.env"
            "azure-sdk/azure-mcp:<version-number-of-docker-image>",
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Live Tests

| `Paths`             | string[] | REQUIRED. Path filters to apply (e.g., `Storage`, `core/`). All filters are applied as substring matches. (e.g., `*Storage*`, `*core/*`) |
| `SubscriptionId`    | string | Target subscription ID. If omitted, the current Azure context subscription (from `Get-AzContext`) is used.                                 |
| `ResourceGroupName` | string | Resource group name. Defaults to `{username}-mcp{hash(username)}`.                                                                         |
| `BaseName`          | string | Base name prefix for resources. Defaults to `mcp{hash}`.                                                                                   |
| `Unique`            | switch | Use a unique GUID-based hash for this invocation instead of the stable username+subscription hash.                                         |
| `DeleteAfterHours`  | int    | Hours after which resources are tagged for deletion. Defaults to `12`.                                                                     |

Examples:

```pwsh
# Deploy Storage test resources using current Azure context subscription
./eng/scripts/Deploy-TestResources.ps1 -Paths Storage

# Deploy Key Vault test resources to a specific subscription and keep for one week
./eng/scripts/Deploy-TestResources.ps1 -Paths KeyVault -SubscriptionId <subId> -DeleteAfterHours 168 -Unique
```

After deploying test resources, you should have a `.testsettings.json` file with your deployment information in the deployed paths' `/tests` directory.

Run live tests with:

```pwsh
./eng/scripts/Test-Code.ps1 -TestType Live
```

You can scope tests to specific paths:

```pwsh
./eng/scripts/Test-Code.ps1 -TestType Live -Paths Storage, KeyVault
```

### NPX Live Tests

You can set the `TestPackage` parameter in `.testsettings.json` to have live tests run `npx` targeting an arbitrary Azure MCP package:

```json
{
  "TenantId": "a20062a8-ff76-41c2-8a6d-5e843da7b051",
  "TenantName": "Your Tenant",
  "SubscriptionId": "cd27afdc-9976-4f08-96e9-cad120a91560",
  "SubscriptionName": "Your Subscription",
  "ResourceGroupName": "rg-abcdefg",
  "ResourceBaseName": "t1234567890",
  "TestPackage": "@azure/mcp@0.0.10"
}
```

To run live tests against the local build of an npm module:

```pwsh
./eng/scripts/Build-Local.ps1
```

This will produce .tgz files in the `.dist` directory and set the `TestPackage` parameter in the `.testsettings.json` file:

```json
"TestPackage": "file://D:\\repos\\azure-mcp\\.dist\\wrapper\\azure-mcp-0.0.12-alpha.1746488279.tgz"
```

### Recording Live Tests

All new live tests **must** be recorded for playback. Live tests use the Azure SDK Test Proxy to capture and replay HTTP traffic, ensuring CI can validate tests without live Azure resources. For the full migration guide, recording workflow, sanitizer/matcher configuration, and troubleshooting tips, see [docs/recorded-tests.md](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/docs/recorded-tests.md).

### Debugging Live Tests

This section assumes that the necessary Azure resources for live tests are already deployed and that the `.testsettings.json` file with deployment information is located in the area's `/tests/` directory.

To debug the Azure MCP Server (`azmcp`) when running live tests in VS Code:

1. Build the package with debug symbols: `./eng/scripts/Build-Local.ps1`
2. Set a breakpoint in a command file (e.g., [`KeyValueListCommand.ExecuteAsync`](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/4ed650a0507921273acc7b382a79049809ef39c1/src/Commands/AppConfig/KeyValue/KeyValueListCommand.cs#L48))
3. In VS Code, navigate to a test method (e.g., [`AppConfigCommandTests::Should_list_appconfig_kvs()`](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/4ed650a0507921273acc7b382a79049809ef39c1/tests/Client/AppConfigCommandTests.cs#L56)), add a breakpoint to `CallToolAsync` call in the test method, then right-click and select **Debug Test**
4. Find the `azmcp` process ID:

    ```shell
    pgrep -fl azmcp
    ```

    ```powershell
    Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -like "*azmcp*" } | Select-Object Id, ProcessName, Path
    ```

5. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux), select **Debug: Attach to .NET 5+ or .NET Core process**, and enter the `azmcp` process ID
6. Hit F5 to "Continue" debugging, the debugger should attach to `azmcp` and hit the breakpoint in command file

## Quality and Standards

### Code Style

To ensure consistent code quality, code format checks will run during all PR and CI builds. Run `dotnet format` before submitting to catch format errors early.

#### Spelling Check

To ensure consistent spelling across the codebase, run the spelling check before submitting:

```pwsh
.\eng\common\spelling\Invoke-Cspell.ps1
```

This will check all files for spelling errors using the project's dictionary. Add project-specific technical terms or proper nouns to the `cspell.yaml` in that project folder. Add cross-cutting terms used by multiple projects to `.vscode/cspell.json`.

#### Requirements

- Follow C# coding conventions
- No comments in implementation code (code should be self-documenting)
- Use descriptive variable and method names
- Follow the exact file structure and naming conventions
- Use proper error handling patterns
- XML documentation for public APIs
- Follow Model Context Protocol (MCP) patterns

### AOT Compatibility Analysis

The AOT compatibility analysis helps identify potential issues that might prevent the Azure MCP Server from working correctly when compiled with AOT or when trimming is enabled.

#### Running the Analysis

To run the AOT compatibility analysis locally:

```pwsh
./eng/scripts/Analyze-AOT-Compact.ps1
```

The HTML report will be generated at `.work/aotCompactReport/aot-compact-report.html` and automatically opened in your default browser.

To output the report to console, run the analysis with `-OutputFormat Console` argument.

AOT compatibility warnings typically indicate:

- Use of reflection without proper annotations
- Serialization of types that might be trimmed
- Dynamic code generation
- Use of `RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute` methods without proper precautions

#### Installing Git Hooks

You can install our pre-push hook to catch code format issues by automatically running `dotnet format` before each `git push`:

- `./eng/scripts/Install-GitHooks.ps1` - Installs the pre-push hook into your local repo
- `./eng/scripts/Remove-GitHooks.ps1` - Disables any git hooks in your local repo

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Azure MCP Server implements the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). When adding new commands:

- Follow MCP JSON schema patterns
- Implement proper context handling
- Use standardized response formats
- Handle errors according to MCP specifications
- Provide proper argument suggestions

### Package README

A single package README.md could be used to generate context specific content for different package types (npm, nuget, vsix) using html comment annotations to mark sections for removal or insertion when processed with script at `.\eng\scripts\Process-PackageReadMe.ps1`

Supported comment annotations:

- Section Removal
  - **Purpose:** Remove one or more lines, or parts of a line of markdown for specified package types.
  - **Example:**
  ```
  <!-- remove-section: start nuget;npm remove_various_lines -->
  ......
  various markdown lines to be removed for nuget and npm
  ......
  <!-- remove-section: end remove_various_lines -->
  ```

- Section Insert
  - **Purpose:** Insert a chunk of text into a line for a specified package type.
  - **Example:**
  `<!-- insert-section: nuget;vsix;npm {{Text to be inserted}} -->`

You can verify that your README.md was annotated correctly using the `Validate-PackageReadme` function:
```
& "eng\scripts\Process-PackageReadMe.ps1" -Command "validate" -InputReadMePath "<README.md Path>"
```

To extract README.md for a specific package, run the `Extract-PackageSpecificReadMe` function:
```
& "eng\scripts\Process-PackageReadMe.ps1" -Command "extract" `
    -InputReadMePath "<README.md Path>" `
    -OutputDirectory "<Output Directory for the package specific README.md>" `
    -PackageType "<npm, nuget, or vsix>" `
    -InsertPayload "<Package specific content to be inserted>"
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuring External MCP Servers

The Azure MCP Server supports connecting to external MCP servers through an embedded `registry.json` configuration file. This enables the server to act as a proxy, aggregating tools from multiple MCP servers into a single interface.

#### Registry Configuration

External MCP servers are defined in the embedded resource file `servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/Resources/registry.json`. This file contains server configurations that support both SSE (Server-Sent Events) and stdio transport mechanisms, following a format similar to the standard MCP configuration format.

The registry structure follows this format:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "documentation": {
      "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp",
      "description": "Search official Microsoft/Azure documentation..."
    },
    "another-stdio-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "path/to/executable",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {
        "ENV_VAR": "value"
      },
      "description": "Another MCP server using stdio transport"
    },
    "another-http-server": {
      "url": "<server_endpoint>",
      "title": "<server_title>",
      "description": "Another MCP server that offers X, Y, Z features",
      "toolPrefix": "uniqueprefix_",
      "oauthScopes": ["Entra-client-ID/identifier-uri"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Transport Types

**SSE (Server-Sent Events) Transport:**

- Use the `url` property to specify the endpoint
- Supports HTTP-based communication with automatic transport mode detection
- Best for web-based MCP servers and remote endpoints
- Use `title` as the display name for the namespace tool (optional)
- Use `description` as the description of the namespace tool for the MCP server
- Use `toolPrefix` to assign unique prefix to tools of the MCP server
- If the MCP server requires authentication, use `oauthScopes` to specify the Entra client registration representing the MCP server

When running in namespace mode, the registered MCP server will appear as a namespace tool like all the built-in namespaces, exposing the underlying tools via dynamic discovery. When running in all mode, the registered MCP server's tools will be listed along with all the built-in tools.

For HTTP-transport external servers, Azure MCP supports unauthenticated endpoints and Entra ID-protected endpoints (via `oauthScopes`). The registered MCP server needs to have an Entra app registration that accepts authorization and token requests from common clients (e.g. Azure CLI and VS Code). Depending on how Azure MCP runs, there are several different authentication scenarios involving the external MCP server.

- Azure MCP runs in stdio mode and uses a user principal. For example, a user starts Azure MCP in stdio mode and lets it use AzureCliCredential. The registered MCP server will receive user principal access tokens from Azure MCP.
- Azure MCP runs in stdio mode and uses a service principal. For example, a user runs Azure MCP in stdio mode and lets it use EnvironmentCredential (for example, Managed Identity). The registered MCP server will receive service principal access tokens from Azure MCP.
- Azure MCP runs in remote mode and uses On-Behalf-Of (OBO). For example, a user runs Azure MCP in HTTP mode and hosts it as a service. The user then uses some client to access this Azure MCP service. This Azure MCP service receives a user/service principal access token for itself, exchanges it for a new token for the registered MCP server, and accesses the registered MCP server using the new token. The registered MCP server will receive an OBO token from the Azure MCP service's configured Entra app registration.

There are two kinds of user principals in Entra ID, personal users and organizational users. Each user can be a direct member of a tenant or a guest of a tenant. The configuration of the registered MCP server's Entra client registration may accidentally block access from some users. When adding a registered MCP server that requires authentication, make sure to test the Entra client registration to make sure the expected clients and users can successfully authorize and acquire access tokens for it. Also test the registered MCP server's implementation to make sure it can accept valid access tokens from all kinds of supported scenarios. If a commonly acceptable scenario is by design not supported, document these scenarios in the registered MCP server's entry in [README.md](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/README.md).

**Stdio Transport:**

- Use `type: "stdio"` with the `command` property
- Supports launching external processes that communicate via standard input/output
- Use `args` array for command-line arguments
- Use `env` object for environment variables
- Best for local executables, command-line tools, and local MCP servers

#### Server Discovery and Namespace Filtering

External servers are automatically discovered when the Azure MCP Server starts. They can be filtered using the same namespace mechanisms as built-in commands:

```bash
# Include only specific external servers
azmcp server start --namespace documentation --namespace another-server

# Use namespace mode to group tools exposed by external servers
azmcp server start --mode namespace
```

#### Adding New External MCP Servers

To add a new external MCP server to the registry:

1. Edit `servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/src/Resources/registry.json`
2. Add your server configuration under the `servers` object using VS Code's MCP configuration schema
3. Use a unique identifier as the key
4. Provide either a `url` for SSE transport or `type: "stdio"` with `command` for stdio transport
5. Include a descriptive `description` field
6. Rebuild the project to embed the updated registry

#### Example External Servers

The current registry includes:

- **documentation**: Microsoft Learn documentation search via SSE transport
- Additional external servers can be added following the same pattern as VS Code's mcp.json

External servers integrate seamlessly with the Azure MCP Server's tool aggregation, appearing alongside native Azure commands in the unified tool interface. This allows you to combine local MCP servers, remote MCP endpoints, and Azure-specific tools in a single interface.

## Project Management

### Pull Request Process

1. Update documentation reflecting any changes
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Reference the original issue
4. Wait for review and address any feedback

### Builds and Releases (Internal)

**For instructions on managing Azure MCP releases, follow the [release checklist](https://eng.ms/docs/products/azure-developer-experience/mcp/release-checklist).**

The internal pipeline [azure-mcp](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=7866) is used for all official releases and CI builds. On every merge to main, a build will run and will produce a dynamically named prerelease package on the public dev feed, e.g. [@azure/mcp@0.0.10-beta.4799791](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-js/Npm/@azure%2Fmcp/overview/0.0.10-beta.4799791).

Only manual runs of the pipeline sign and publish packages. Building `main` or `hotfix/*` will publish to `npmjs.com`, all other refs will publish to the [public dev feed](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_artifacts/feed/azure-sdk-for-js).

Packages published to npmjs.com will always use the `@latest` [dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally#installing-a-package-with-dist-tags).

Packages published to the dev feed will use:

- `@latest` for the latest official/release build
- `@dev` for the latest CI build of main
- `@pre` for any arbitrary pipeline run or feature branch build

#### PR Validation

To run live tests for a PR, inspect the PR code for any suspicious changes, then add the comment `/azp run  mcp - pullrequest - live` to the pull request. This will queue a PR triggered run which will build, run unit tests, deploy test resources and run live tests.

If you would like to see the product of a PR as a package on the dev feed, after thoroughly inspecting the change, create a branch in the main repo and manually trigger an [azure - mcp](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/internal/_build?definitionId=7571) pipeline run against that branch. This will queue a manually triggered run which will build, run unit tests, deploy test resources, run live tests, sign and publish the packages to the dev feed.

Instructions for consuming the package from the dev feed can be found in the "Extensions" tab of the pipeline run page.

**CI Validation Checks**:

All PRs automatically run the following validation checks:
- **Code formatting** - Ensures code follows project formatting standards
- **Spelling check** - Validates spelling across the codebase
- **AOT compatibility** - Checks ahead-of-time compilation compatibility
- **Tool metadata verification** - Ensures `azmcp-commands.md` is up-to-date with tool metadata (run `.\eng\scripts\Update-AzCommandsMetadata.ps1` if this fails)
