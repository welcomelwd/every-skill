# Vally Evaluator

VallyEvaluator generates [Vally](https://microsoft.github.io/vally/) evaluation specifications from the MCP end-to-end prompts maintained in this repository. It converts each non-interactive prompt into a Vally stimulus with a `tool-calls` grader that verifies the expected MCP namespace and command.

The evaluator generates specifications; it does not execute them. Use `eng/scripts/Invoke-VallyEvalTests.ps1` to run the generated specifications with Vally.

## Prerequisites

- The .NET SDK selected by the repository's `global.json`
- [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) to use the repository scripts
- [Vally](https://microsoft.github.io/vally/get-started/install/) to run evaluations
- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-sdk/setup/local-cli), authenticated with `copilot login`

CI installs the Vally CLI with:

```powershell
npm install --global @microsoft/vally-cli@0.13.0
```

See [Testing with Vally](../../../docs/testing-with-vally.md) for repository-wide setup and eval authoring guidance.

## Generate Evaluations

Generate evaluations for selected tool namespaces:

```powershell
dotnet run --project ./eng/tools/VallyEvaluator/src/VallyEvaluator.csproj -- `
  --serverName Azure.Mcp.Server `
  --namespaces "storage,appconfig"
```

Generate evaluations for every namespace represented in Azure MCP Server's prompt file:

```powershell
dotnet run --project ./eng/tools/VallyEvaluator/src/VallyEvaluator.csproj -- `
  --serverName Azure.Mcp.Server
```

The tool derives its prompt file from the required server name using `servers/<serverName>/docs/e2eTestPrompts.md`. It writes one file per namespace under:

```text
.work/vally/evals/<namespace>/eval.yaml
```

Existing generated `eval.yaml` files are overwritten. Prompts marked as requiring interaction are excluded because Vally runs must be unattended.

VallyEvaluator is not limited to Azure MCP Server. Any server can be used when it provides the expected prompt file. Generating specifications does not require a matching entry in `.vally.yaml`; executing them does require a Vally environment that launches the selected server.

## Command-Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--namespaces` | Comma-separated tool namespaces to generate, such as `storage,acr`. | All namespaces in the prompt file when build info is not supplied. |
| `--workingDirectory` | Root directory for generated Vally artifacts and server build artifacts. | `<repo-root>/.work` |
| `--buildInfo` | Path to a `build_info.json` file. Limits generation to namespaces represented by `pathsToTest`. | Not set. |
| `--serverName` | Required MCP server name. Selects `servers/<serverName>/docs/e2eTestPrompts.md` and the matching build-info entry. | Required. |

When both `--buildInfo` and `--namespaces` are supplied, the generated set is the union of namespaces selected by both options.

### Generate from Build Information

Build-info mode is intended for CI and changed-project evaluation. It requires a build-info file and server artifacts for the current runtime under `<workingDirectory>/build` so the evaluator can map assemblies to tool namespaces.

```powershell
./eng/scripts/Build-Local.ps1 -ServerName Azure.Mcp.Server
dotnet run --project ./eng/tools/VallyEvaluator/src/VallyEvaluator.csproj -- `
  --serverName Azure.Mcp.Server `
  --buildInfo ./.work/build_info.json
```

A custom server and working directory can be selected explicitly:

```powershell
dotnet run --project ./eng/tools/VallyEvaluator/src/VallyEvaluator.csproj -- `
  --buildInfo ./artifacts/build_info.json `
  --serverName Fabric.Mcp.Server `
  --workingDirectory ./artifacts
```

## Run Evaluations

Build the MCP server, generate the specifications, and then invoke the wrapper:

```powershell
./eng/scripts/Build-Local.ps1 -ServerName Azure.Mcp.Server
dotnet run --project ./eng/tools/VallyEvaluator/src/VallyEvaluator.csproj -- `
  --serverName Azure.Mcp.Server `
  --namespaces "storage,appconfig"
./eng/scripts/Invoke-VallyEvalTests.ps1
```

The wrapper reads generated specs from `.work/vally/evals`, includes checked-in `eval.yaml` files referenced by `.work/build_info.json`, and writes results to `.work/vally/vally-results`.

The repository's `.vally.yaml` currently configures Azure MCP Server environments only. Generating specifications for another server also requires a corresponding Vally environment before those specifications can run.

Useful wrapper options include:

```powershell
./eng/scripts/Invoke-VallyEvalTests.ps1 `
  -NumberOfRuns 3 `
  -IsDebug `
  -OutputPath ./.work/vally/custom-results
```

For deterministic agent behavior, the wrapper temporarily replaces `<WorkDirectory>/AGENTS.md` with `src/Resources/eval.instructions.md` and restores the original file after Vally exits. A custom `-WorkDirectory` must already contain an `AGENTS.md` file. If no generated or checked-in specifications are found, the wrapper exits successfully without invoking Vally.
