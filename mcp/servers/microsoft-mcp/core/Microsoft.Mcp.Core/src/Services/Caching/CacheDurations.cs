///   <item><description><see cref="AuthenticatedClient"/> – Authenticated clients (e.g., SDK client instances) are more dynamic and should be refreshed more frequently.</description></item>
///   <item><description><see cref="ServiceData"/> – Service data is critical for user interactions and should have a short cache duration to avoid stale data.</description></item>
