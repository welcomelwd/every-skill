Follow ALL of the following rules to provide CI/CD pipeline files and configuration setup instructions:
*Prerequisite Checks*:
{{PrerequisiteChecksPrompt}}
*Pipeline File Generation Guidance*:
- Generate a CI/CD pipeline file using {{DeploymentTool}} for {{PipelinePlatform}}.
- The CI part should include build (and test if applicable). CI should NOT include Azure-related steps, for example, pushing images to ACR.
- The CD part should include multi-environment deployment steps. Images, if applicable, should be pushed to ACR in different environments.
- **'pull_request' should not start CD(deployment).**
- Use different environments according to user-provided Azure resources. Default to use 'dev', 'staging', and 'production' IF NOT SPECIFIED by user. *If user states specific environments, use those.*
- Pay attention to the dependency order among build and multi-environment deployments.

- **You should ONLY care about deployment-related variables like hosting services' names. Ignore application-level variables like connection strings.**
*How you do configurations*:
- Configure Azure authentication and environment setup for the pipeline as per the instructions below.
- You should use a .azure/pipeline-setup.md file to outline the steps. The file should contain the steps and explain the tasks to be done by the user.
