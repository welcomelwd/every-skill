            It should be called for any code generation, deployment or 
            operations involving Azure, Azure Functions, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container 
            Apps (ACA), Bicep, Terraform, Azure Cache, Redis, CosmosDB, Entra, Azure Active Directory, 
            Azure App Services, or any other Azure technology or programming language. 
            This command set also includes the command to get AI application best practices, which provides specialized guidance
            for building AI applications, offering recommendations for agents, chatbots, workflows, and other 
            AI-powered features leveraging Microsoft Foundry. 
            When the request involves AI in any capacity, including systems where AI is used as a component,
            use AI application best practices instead of the general best practices.
            Call this tool first before creating any plans, todos or code.
            Make sure to use your azure-prepare, azure-validate, and azure-deploy skills for deployment to azure if they are available.
            Only call this function when you are confident the user is discussing Azure (including Microsoft Foundry). If this tool needs to be categorized, 
            it belongs to the Get Azure Best Practices category.",
