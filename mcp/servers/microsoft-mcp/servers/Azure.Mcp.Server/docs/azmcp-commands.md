# Azure MCP CLI Command Reference

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure MCP Server has two modes: MCP Server mode and CLI mode.  When you start the MCP Server with `azmcp server start` that will expose an endpoint for MCP Client communication. The `azmcp` CLI also exposes all of the tools via a command line interface, i.e. `azmcp subscription list`.  In this document, "command" refers to CLI commands (e.g., `azmcp storage account list`), while "tool" refers to MCP server tools that can be invoked by MCP clients.

## Global Options

The following options are available for most commands:

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--subscription` | No | Environment variable `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Azure subscription ID for target resources |
| `--tenant-id` | No | - | Azure tenant ID for authentication |
| `--auth-method` | No | 'credential' | Authentication method ('credential', 'key', 'connectionString') |
| `--retry-max-retries` | No | 3 | Maximum retry attempts for failed operations |
| `--retry-delay` | No | 2 | Delay between retry attempts (seconds) |
| `--retry-max-delay` | No | 10 | Maximum delay between retries (seconds) |
| `--retry-mode` | No | 'exponential' | Retry strategy ('fixed' or 'exponential') |
| `--retry-network-timeout` | No | 100 | Network operation timeout (seconds) |
| `--learn` | No | false | Discover available sub-commands and their parameters without executing any Azure operation. Use on a command group to list commands in that group, or on a specific command to see its options. |

### Discovery with `--learn`

The `--learn` flag enables AI agents and users to progressively discover the Azure MCP CLI without starting an MCP server. It works at every level of the command hierarchy:

```bash
# List all commands available under the 'storage' namespace
azmcp storage --learn

# List all commands under 'storage account'
azmcp storage account --learn

# Show the options for a specific command without executing it
azmcp storage account list --learn
```

The output is a JSON `CommandResponse` containing a list of `CommandInfo` objects with the command name, description, full CLI path, and all supported options. This is equivalent to the `learn` parameter supported by the Azure MCP server tools in namespace mode.

### CLI Logging

In CLI mode, all `azmcp` commands write only JSON to **stdout**. Informational and diagnostic log messages are written to **stderr**. This means AI agents and tools consuming stdout receive clean JSON without log noise.

To see logs while running a CLI command:

```powershell
# Show logs in terminal alongside JSON output (PowerShell / bash)
azmcp storage account list --subscription <sub> 2>&1

# Capture JSON silently, discard logs (PowerShell)
$json = azmcp storage account list --subscription <sub> 2>$null

# Write logs to a file while JSON goes to stdout
azmcp storage account list --subscription <sub> 2>azmcp.log
```

## Available Commands

### Server Operations

The Azure MCP Server can be started in several different modes depending on how you want to expose the Azure tools:

#### Using azmcp locally vs in container images

The commands in this document assume you are running the **`azmcp` CLI locally**
for example as a .NET global tool. In that case the executable is called
`azmcp` and commands such as:

```bash
azmcp server start --mode namespace --transport=stdio
```

are valid.

When you run the **Azure MCP Server container image** `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azure-mcp` (for example in Azure Container Apps),
the image already contains an entrypoint that starts the MCP server process.
The image does **not** support overriding the container command with `azmcp ...` directly, as the entrypoint is already configured to start the server.
- Do **not** override the container command / entrypoint with `azmcp ...` when
  deploying the image. Doing so will cause the container to fail to start.
- Leave the command / entrypoint blank in Azure Container Apps so the default
  image entrypoint is used.
- If you need to customize the startup command or add extra arguments, build
  your own image based on the Azure MCP Server and set the ENTRYPOINT and/or
  CMD values in your Dockerfile there. That way you control exactly how the
  server starts without replacing the upstream image entrypoint at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> ENTRYPOINT defines the executable that always runs; CMD provides
> default arguments to that executable. Overriding the container command in
> many PaaS providers replaces the image's ENTRYPOINT/CMD behavior, which can
> break startup. The Azure MCP Server image ENTRYPOINT in the repository is:

```text
ENTRYPOINT ["./server-binary", "server", "start"]
```

Because the image sets a fixed entrypoint, passing a container command such
as `azmcp ...` will replace or conflict with that entrypoint. If you must
change startup behavior, create a small derived Dockerfile that modifies the
ENTRYPOINT/CMD as needed and deploy your custom image instead of overriding
the command in the PaaS UI.

For the exact Dockerfile used to build the image see:
https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/Dockerfile

The remaining sections describe the different server modes that apply to both
the CLI and the container image entrypoint.

#### Default Mode (Namespace)

Exposes Azure tools grouped by service namespace. Each Azure service appears as a single namespace-level tool that routes to individual operations internally. This is the default mode to reduce tool count and prevent VS Code from hitting the 128 tool limit.

```bash
# Start MCP Server with namespace-level tools (default behavior)
azmcp server start \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]

# Explicitly specify namespace mode
azmcp server start \
    --mode namespace \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]
```

#### All Tools Mode

Exposes all Azure tools individually. Each Azure service operation appears as a separate MCP tool.

```bash
# Start MCP Server with all tools exposed individually
azmcp server start \
    --mode all \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]
```

#### Single Tool Mode

Exposes a single "azure" tool that handles internal routing across all Azure MCP tools.

```bash
# Start MCP Server with single azure tool
azmcp server start \
    --mode single \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]
```

#### Namespace Filtering

Exposes only tools for specific Azure service namespaces. Use multiple `--namespace` parameters to include multiple namespaces.

```bash
# Start MCP Server with only Storage tools
azmcp server start \
    --namespace storage \
    --mode all \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]

# Start MCP Server with Storage and Key Vault tools
azmcp server start \
    --namespace storage \
    --namespace keyvault \
    --mode all \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]
```

#### Specific Tool Filtering

Exposes only specific tools by name, providing the finest level of granularity. The `--namespace` and `--tool` options cannot be used together. Use multiple `--tool` parameters to include multiple tools. Using `--tool` automatically switches to `all` mode.

```bash
# Start MCP Server with default mode and only subscription and resource group tools
azmcp server start \
    --tool azmcp_subscription_list \
    --tool azmcp_group_list \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]

# Start MCP Server with all mode and essential storage management tools
azmcp server start \
    --mode all \
    --tool azmcp_storage_account_get \
    --tool azmcp_storage_account_create \
    --tool azmcp_storage_blob_get \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]
```

#### Consolidated Mode

Exposes carefully curated tools that group related Azure operations together based on common user workflows and tasks. This mode provides the optimal balance between discoverability and usability by organizing consolidated tools that combine multiple related operations.

Each consolidated tool groups operations that are commonly used together:
- **Resource management**: Groups operations by resource type and action (get, create, edit, delete)
- **Workflow-based**: Organizes tools around common tasks (deployment, monitoring, security)
- **Metadata-aligned**: Only groups commands with exactly the same toolMetadata values (destructive, idempotent, readOnly, etc.)

**Benefits:**
- **Better for AI agents**: Reduces decision complexity by presenting meaningful tool groupings
- **Optimized tool count**: Well under VS Code's 128-tool limit
- **Task-oriented**: Tools are named after user intents (e.g., `get_azure_databases_details`, `deploy_azure_resources_and_applications`)
- **Maintains functionality**: All individual commands are still accessible through the consolidated tools

```bash
# Start MCP Server with consolidated mode
azmcp server start \
    --mode consolidated \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--namespace <namespace>] \
    [--read-only]
```

**Configuration file location**: The consolidated tool definitions are maintained in `core/Azure.Mcp.Core/src/Areas/Server/Resources/consolidated-tools.json`. Each definition includes:
- Tool name and description optimized for AI agent selection
- List of mapped individual commands
- Matching toolMetadata (destructive, idempotent, readOnly, secret, etc.)

#### Namespace Mode (Default)

Collapses all tools within each namespace into a single tool (e.g., all storage operations become one "storage" tool with internal routing). This mode is particularly useful when working with MCP clients that have tool limits - for example, VS Code only supports a maximum of 128 tools across all registered MCP servers.

```bash
# Start MCP Server with service proxy tools
azmcp server start \
    --mode namespace \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]
```

#### Single Tool Proxy Mode

Exposes a single "azure" tool that handles internal routing across all Azure MCP tools.

```bash
# Start MCP Server with single Azure tool proxy
azmcp server start \
    --mode single \
    [--transport <transport>] \
    [--read-only]
```

> **Note:**
>
> - For namespace mode, replace `<namespace-name>` with available top level command groups. Run `azmcp -h` to review available namespaces. Examples include `storage`, `keyvault`, `cosmos`, `monitor`, etc.
> - The `--read-only` flag applies to all modes and filters the tool list to only contain tools that provide read-only operations.
> - Multiple `--namespace` parameters can be used together to expose tools for multiple specific namespaces.
> - The `--namespace` and `--mode` parameters can also be combined to provide a unique running mode based on the desired scenario.

#### Server Start Command Options

The `azmcp server start` command supports the following options:

| Option | Required | Default | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--transport` | No | `stdio` | Transport mechanism to use. Valid values: `stdio` (default, supported in all distributions) or `http` (supported only in the Docker image distribution and other builds with HTTP enabled; may not be available in local CLI builds). |
| `--mode` | No | `namespace` | Server mode: `namespace` (default), `consolidated`, `all`, or `single` |
| `--namespace` | No | All namespaces | Specific Azure service namespaces to expose (can be repeated). Works with all existing modes to filter tools. |
| `--tool` | No | All tools | Expose specific tools by name (e.g., 'azmcp_storage_account_get'). It automatically switches to `all` mode. It can't be used together with `--namespace`. |
| `--read-only` | No | `false` | Only expose read-only operations |
| `--debug` | No | `false` | Enable verbose debug logging to stderr |
| `--dangerously-disable-http-incoming-auth` | No | false | Dangerously disable HTTP incoming authentication |
| `--dangerously-disable-elicitation` | No | `false` | **⚠️ DANGEROUS**: Disable user consent prompts for sensitive operations |
| `--outgoing-auth-strategy` | No | `NotSet` | Outgoing authentication strategy for service requests. Valid values: `NotSet`, `UseHostingEnvironmentIdentity`, `UseOnBehalfOf`. |
| `--dangerously-write-support-logs-to-dir` | No | - | **⚠️ DANGEROUS**: Enables detailed debug-level logging for support and troubleshooting. Specify a folder path where log files will be created with timestamp-based filenames. May include sensitive information in logs. |
| `--cloud` | No | `AzureCloud` | Azure cloud environment for authentication. Valid values: `AzureCloud` (default), `AzureChinaCloud`, `AzureUSGovernment`, or a custom authority host URL starting with `https://`. When a custom authority host URL is used, only the authentication authority host is changed; ARM and other service endpoints continue to use the Azure public cloud. |
| `--disable-caching` | No | `false` | Disable caching of resource responses, requiring repeated requests to fetch fresh data each time. |

> **⚠️ Security Warning for `--dangerously-disable-elicitation`:**
>
> This option disables user confirmations (elicitations) before running tools that read sensitive data. When enabled:
> - Tools that handle secrets, credentials, or sensitive data will execute without user confirmation
> - This removes an important security layer designed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information
> - Only use this option in trusted, automated environments where user interaction is not possible
> - Never use this option in production environments or when handling untrusted input
>
> **Example usage (use with caution):**
> ```bash
> # For automated scenarios only - bypasses security prompts
> azmcp server start --dangerously-disable-elicitation
> ```

> **⚠️ Security Warning for `--dangerously-write-support-logs-to-dir`:**
>
> This option enables detailed debug-level logging that may include sensitive information such as request payloads and authentication details. When enabled:
> - Log files are created in the specified directory with timestamp-based filenames (e.g., `azmcp_20251202_143052.log`)
> - Logs may contain sensitive data that could be useful for support troubleshooting
> - Only use this option when specifically requested by support for diagnosing issues
> - Remove log files after troubleshooting is complete
>
> **Example usage:**
> ```bash
> # For support troubleshooting only
> azmcp server start --dangerously-write-support-logs-to-dir /path/to/logs
> ```

> **Note on `--outgoing-auth-strategy`:**
>
> This option controls how the server authenticates when making requests to downstream Azure services:
> - `NotSet` (default): A safe default is chosen based on other settings
> - `UseHostingEnvironmentIdentity`: Uses the hosting environment's identity (similar to `DefaultAzureCredential`). All outgoing requests use the same identity regardless of the incoming request's identity
> - `UseOnBehalfOf`: Exchanges the incoming request's access token for a new token valid for the downstream service. Only valid when the server is running with HTTP transport and incoming HTTP authentication enabled (i.e., `--transport http` without `--dangerously-disable-http-incoming-auth`)

> **Note on `--cloud`:**
>
> Use this option to target sovereign cloud environments:
> - `AzureCloud` (default): Azure public cloud
> - `AzureChinaCloud`: Azure China (operated by 21Vianet)
> - `AzureUSGovernment`: Azure US Government
> - Custom URL: A custom authority host URL starting with `https://`
>
> **Example usage:**
> ```bash
> # Connect to Azure US Government cloud
> azmcp server start --cloud AzureUSGovernment
> ```

### Azure AI Services Speech Operations

```bash
# Recognize speech from an audio file using Azure AI Services Speech
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ✅ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ✅ LocalRequired
azmcp speech stt recognize --endpoint <endpoint> \
                           --file <file-path> \
                           [--language <language>] \
                           [--phrases <phrase-hints>] \
                           [--format <simple|detailed>] \
                           [--profanity <masked|removed|raw>]
```

#### Phrase Hints for Improved Accuracy

The `--phrases` parameter supports multiple ways to specify phrase hints that improve speech recognition accuracy:

**Multiple Arguments:**
```bash
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ✅ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ✅ LocalRequired
azmcp speech stt recognize --endpoint <endpoint> --file audio.wav \
    --phrases "Azure" --phrases "cognitive services" --phrases "machine learning"
```

**Comma-Separated Values:**
```bash
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ✅ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ✅ LocalRequired
azmcp speech stt recognize --endpoint <endpoint> --file audio.wav \
    --phrases "Azure, cognitive services, machine learning"
```

**Mixed Syntax:**
```bash
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ✅ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ✅ LocalRequired
azmcp speech stt recognize --endpoint <endpoint> --file audio.wav \
    --phrases "Azure, cognitive services" --phrases "machine learning"
```

Use phrase hints when you expect specific terminology, technical terms, or domain-specific vocabulary in your audio content. This significantly improves recognition accuracy for specialized content.

```bash
# Synthesize speech from text and save to an audio file using Azure AI Services Speech
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ❌ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ✅ LocalRequired
azmcp speech tts synthesize --endpoint <endpoint> \
                            --text <text-to-synthesize> \
                            --outputAudio <output-file-path> \
                            [--language <language>] \
                            [--voice <voice-name>] \
                            [--format <audio-format>] \
                            [--endpointId <custom-voice-endpoint-id>]
```

### Azure Backup Operations

#### Vault

```bash
# Creates a new backup vault. Specify --vault-type as 'rsv' for a Recovery Services vault or 'dpp' for a Backup vault (Data Protection). For DPP vaults a System-Assigned Managed Identity is enabled by default so the vault can authenticate to protected datasources (storage accounts, disks, PG Flex, etc.) - change later with 'azurebackup vault update --identity-type ...' if needed. Returns the created vault details.

# Retrieves backup vault information. When --vault and --resource-group are specified, returns detailed information about a single vault including type, location, SKU, and storage redundancy. When omitted, lists all backup vaults (RSV and Backup vaults) in the subscription. Optionally filter by --vault-type ('rsv' or 'dpp') and/or --resource-group to narrow the listing results. Use --expand to include extended posture fields: 'security' (encryption key URI and cross-region restore state; DPP vaults additionally return encryption state — RSV vaults omit it because the vault GET API does not return an explicit state field), 'mua' (Multi-User Authorization / Resource Guard link), or 'all'.

- **With `--resource-group` only**: Lists all VMs in the specified resource group.
- **With neither**: Lists all VMs in the subscription.

**Returns:**
- VM information including name, location, VM size, provisioning state, OS type, license type, zones, and tags.
- When `--instance-view` is specified: Also includes power state, provisioning state, VM agent status, disk status, and extension status.

**Parameters:**

                        [--os-disk-type <os-disk-type>]

Defaults to Standard_D2s_v5 size when `--vm-size` is not specified. `--image` is required and has no default; specify an alias (e.g., `Ubuntu2404`, `Win2022Datacenter`), a Marketplace URN (`publisher:offer:sku:version`), or a shared gallery image ID (starting with `/sharedGalleries/`). When new NSG rules are created, SSH/RDP access is allowed from any source unless `--source-address-prefix` is provided.

                        --no-public-ip
```

**Image Formats:**

The `--image` option accepts three formats:

1. **Alias** — a short name that maps to a predefined Marketplace image or shared gallery image (see table below).
2. **Marketplace URN** — `publisher:offer:sku:version` (e.g., `MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer2022:2022-datacenter-azure-edition:latest`).
3. **Shared gallery image ID** — a path starting with `/sharedGalleries/` (e.g., `/sharedGalleries/WINDOWSSERVER.1P/images/2022-DATACENTER-AZURE-EDITION/versions/latest`).

If omitted, defaults to `Ubuntu2404`.

**Image Aliases:**

Marketplace aliases map to a `publisher:offer:sku:version` URN:

| Alias | OS | Publisher | Offer | SKU | Version |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|-----|---------|
| `Ubuntu2604` | Linux | Canonical | ubuntu-26_04-lts | server | latest |
| `Ubuntu2404` | Linux | Canonical | ubuntu-24_04-lts | server | latest |
| `Ubuntu2204` | Linux | Canonical | 0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy | 22_04-lts-gen2 | latest |
| `Debian12` | Linux | Debian | debian-12 | 12-gen2 | latest |
| `Debian11` | Linux | Debian | debian-11 | 11-gen2 | latest |
| `RHEL9` | Linux | RedHat | RHEL | 9_0 | latest |
| `CentOS8` | Linux | OpenLogic | CentOS | 8_5-gen2 | latest |
| `Win2022Datacenter` | Windows | MicrosoftWindowsServer | WindowsServer2022 | 2022-datacenter-azure-edition | latest |
| `Win11Pro` | Windows | MicrosoftWindowsDesktop | windows-11 | win11-22h2-pro | latest |
| `Win10Pro` | Windows | MicrosoftWindowsDesktop | Windows-10 | win10-22h2-pro-g2 | latest |

Shared gallery aliases map to a shared gallery image ID:

| Alias | OS | Shared Gallery Image ID |
|-------|------|-------------------------|
| `Win2022Datacenter1P` | Windows | `/sharedGalleries/WINDOWSSERVER.1P/images/2022-DATACENTER-AZURE-EDITION/versions/latest` |

**Command Behavior:**
- Changes the power state of a virtual machine. Equivalent to `az vm start/stop/deallocate/restart`.
- **start**: Powers on a stopped or deallocated VM.
- **stop**: Shuts down the OS and powers off the VM (VM is still allocated and billing continues). Use `--skip-shutdown` to force power off without OS shutdown.
- **deallocate**: Shuts down the OS, powers off the VM, and releases compute resources (billing stops for compute).
- **restart**: Restarts the VM (equivalent to stop then start).
- **With `--no-wait`**: Returns immediately after initiating the operation without waiting for completion.

**Returns:**
- VM name, ID, resource group, requested power action, completion status, and a status message.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--subscription` | Yes | Azure subscription ID |
| `--resource-group`, `-g` | Yes | Resource group name |
| `--vm-name` | Yes | Name of the virtual machine |
| `--power-action` | Yes | Power action to apply (not the current power state): `start`, `stop`, `deallocate`, or `restart` |
| `--no-wait` | No | Return immediately without waiting for the operation to complete |
| `--skip-shutdown` | No | Skip OS shutdown when stopping (force power off). Only valid with `--power-action stop` |

```

**Command Behavior:**
- Creates a new Azure managed disk in the specified resource group.
- Either `--size-gb`, `--source`, `--gallery-image-reference`, or `--upload-type` must be specified.
- When `--source` is a resource ID (snapshot or managed disk), the disk is created as a copy. When `--source` is a blob URI, the disk is imported from the VHD.
- When `--gallery-image-reference` is specified, the disk is created from a Shared Image Gallery image version. Use `--gallery-image-reference-lun` to select a specific data disk from the image; if omitted, the OS disk is used.
- When `--upload-type` is specified with `--upload-size-bytes`, creates a disk in a ready-to-upload state. Use `UploadWithSecurityData` with `--security-type` and `--hyper-v-generation V2` for Trusted Launch or Confidential VM scenarios.
- If `--location` is not specified, defaults to the resource group's location.
- Supports configuring disk size, storage SKU, OS type, availability zone, hypervisor generation, tags, encryption settings, performance tier, shared disk, network access, on-demand bursting, IOPS and throughput limits (UltraSSD only), upload type, and security type.

#### Secrets

Tools that handle sensitive data such as secrets require user consent before execution through a security mechanism called **elicitation**. When you run commands that access sensitive information, the MCP client will prompt you to confirm the operation before proceeding.

> **🛡️ Elicitation (user confirmation) Security Feature:**
>
> Elicitation prompts appear when tools may expose sensitive information like:
> - Key Vault secrets
> - Connection strings and passwords
> - Certificate private keys
> - Other confidential data
>
> These prompts protect against unauthorized access to sensitive information. You can bypass elicitation in automated scenarios using the `--dangerously-disable-elicitation` server start option, but this should only be used in trusted environments.

# Creates a secret in a key vault (will prompt for user consent)

### Azure MCP Tools

The `azmcp tools list` command provides flexible ways to explore and discover available tools in the Azure MCP server. It supports multiple modes and filtering options that can be combined for precise control over the output format and content.

**Available Options:**
- `--namespace-mode`: List only top-level service namespaces instead of individual tools
- `--name-only`: Return only tool/namespace names without descriptions, options, or metadata
- `--namespace <namespace>`: Filter results to specific namespace(s). Can be used multiple times to include multiple namespaces

**Option Combinations:**
- Use `--name-only` alone to get a simple list of all tool names
- Use `--namespace-mode` alone to see available service namespaces with full details
- Combine `--namespace-mode` and `--name-only` to get just the namespace names
- Use `--namespace` with any other option to filter results to specific services
- All options can be combined for maximum flexibility

```bash
# List all available tools in the Azure MCP server
azmcp tools list

# List only the available top-level service namespaces
azmcp tools list --namespace-mode

# List only tool names without descriptions or metadata
azmcp tools list --name-only

# Filter tools by specific namespace(s)
azmcp tools list --namespace storage
azmcp tools list --namespace storage --namespace keyvault

# Combine options: get namespace names only for specific namespaces
azmcp tools list --namespace-mode --name-only
azmcp tools list --namespace-mode --name-only --namespace storage

# Combine options: get tool names only for specific namespace(s)
azmcp tools list --name-only --namespace storage
azmcp tools list --name-only --namespace storage --namespace keyvault

**Notes:**
- `orchestrator-start` and `orchestrator-next` mirror the orchestration flow used by Azure Monitor onboarding.
- `send-brownfield-analysis` expects a JSON payload matching the `analysisTemplate` returned by `orchestrator-start` when status is `analysis_needed`.
- `send-enhancement-select` expects one or more enhancement keys from `enhancementOptions` returned by `orchestrator-start` when status is `enhancement_available`.

```

#### Resource Group Optimization

The Virtual Desktop commands support an optional `--resource-group` parameter that provides significant performance improvements when specified:

- **Without `--resource-group`**: Commands enumerate through all resources in the subscription
- **With `--resource-group`**: Commands directly access resources within the specified resource group, avoiding subscription-wide enumeration

**Host Pool List Usage:**

```bash
# Standard usage - enumerates all host pools in subscription
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ✅ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ❌ LocalRequired
azmcp virtualdesktop hostpool list --subscription <subscription>

# Optimized usage - lists host pools in specific resource group only
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ✅ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ❌ LocalRequired
azmcp virtualdesktop hostpool list --subscription <subscription> \
                                   --resource-group <resource-group>
```

**Session Host Usage patterns:**

```bash
# Standard usage - enumerates all host pools in subscription
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ✅ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ❌ LocalRequired
azmcp virtualdesktop hostpool host list --subscription <subscription> \
                                                --hostpool <hostpool-name>

# Optimized usage - direct resource group access
# ❌ Destructive | ✅ Idempotent | ❌ OpenWorld | ✅ ReadOnly | ❌ Secret | ❌ LocalRequired
azmcp virtualdesktop hostpool host list --subscription <subscription> \
                                                --hostpool <hostpool-name> \
                                                --resource-group <resource-group>

                            --confidence-score 0.1
```

## Response Format

All responses follow a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "status": "200|403|500, etc",
  "message": "",
  "options": [],
  "results": [],
  "duration": 123
}
```

### Tool and Namespace Result Objects

When invoking `azmcp tools list` (with or without `--namespace-mode`), each returned object now includes a `count` field:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Command or namespace name |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `command` | Fully qualified CLI invocation path |
| `subcommands` | (Namespaces only) Array of leaf command objects |
| `option` | (Leaf commands only) Array of options supported by the command |
| `count` | Namespaces: number of subcommands; Leaf commands: always 0 (options not counted) |

This quantitative field enables quick sizing of a namespace without traversing nested arrays. Leaf command complexity should be inferred from its option list, not the `count` field.

## Error Handling

The CLI returns structured JSON responses for errors, including:

- Service availability issues
- Authentication errors
