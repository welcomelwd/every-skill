# Azure MCP End-to-End Test Prompts

This file contains prompts used for end-to-end testing to ensure each tool is invoked properly by MCP clients. The tables are organized by Azure MCP Server areas in alphabetical order, with Tool Names sorted alphabetically within each table.

The `Interaction` column describes whether a prompt can invoke its tool immediately:

- `none`: The prompt contains enough information for direct tool invocation.
- `clarification-required`: The user must provide missing command parameters.
- `context-required`: The user must provide an attachment, project, or other external context. This includes the deployment of Azure resources.
- `investigation-required`: Tool ownership or command routing requires investigation before this prompt can be evaluated reliably. See https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/issues/3266.
