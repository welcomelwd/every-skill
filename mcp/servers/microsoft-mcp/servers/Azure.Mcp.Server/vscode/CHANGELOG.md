# Release History







## 3.0.36 (2026-08-18) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added the 'azmcp resilience drill get' command to list or retrieve drill details for a service group. [[#3232](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3232)]
- Added the 'azmcp resilience drill resource get' command to list or retrieve resources associated with a drill. [[#3232](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3232)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Tool calls with unknown parameters are now explicitly rejected. [[#3282](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3282)]

## 3.0.35 (2026-08-13) (pre-release)

### Changed

- Improved `foundry` and `foundryexensions` namespace-level tool descriptions.

## 3.0.34 (2026-08-11) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added the 'azmcp resilience usageplan create' command to create or update a resilience usage plan in a resource group, including its plan type. [[#3166](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3166)]
- Added the 'azmcp resilience usageplan enrollment create' command to create or update an enrollment under a resilience usage plan, associating it with a service group. [[#3166](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3166)]

### Fixed

- Improved the Azure Quick Review (azqr) tool, extension namespace, and consolidated tool descriptions so that prompts asking to scan a subscription for compliance issues or compliance recommendations reliably select the `extension_azqr` tool in All and Namespace modes. [[#3134](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3134)]

## 3.0.33 (2026-08-06) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `azmcp advisor metadata get` to retrieve the global Azure Advisor recommendation-type metadata catalog entry (by recommendation type id) from Azure Resource Graph. [[#3178](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3178)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Renamed advisor_recommendation-type_list to advisor_metadata_list and moved recommendation-type discovery from the Advisor ARM API to the global Azure Resource Graph metadata catalog with richer localized details and filters for subcategory, Service Health tracking ID, and service-retirement date. Service-retirement filters (tracking ID or retirement date) apply to the ServiceUpgradeAndRetirement subcategory, and conflicting subcategory filters are rejected. [[#3197](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3197)]
- Added new telemetry collection for 'IsLearn' (indicates if the tool call attempted learning), 'ToolSource' (indication on where the invoked tool is from), 'ToolParameters' (the names of the tool parameters), and 'ToolAnnotations' (the annotations of the tool). [[#3156](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3156)]

## 3.0.32 (2026-08-04) (pre-release)

### Fixed

- Display a warning when VS Code MCP access is disabled and provide a shortcut to the MCP access setting.
- Fixed a bug in EventHubs where creating a new event hub or consumer group could throw an `InvalidOperationException` instead of succeeding, because the `NullableResponse<T>.Value` accessor was dereferenced without checking `HasValue` first. [[#3187](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3187)]

## 3.0.31 (2026-07-31) (pre-release)

### Changed

- Removed `IServiceProvider` from `CommandContext` and downstream locations where no longer used. [[#3185](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3185)]

## 3.0.30 (2026-07-28) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Core tools. [[#3137](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3137)]
- **Breaking:** Removed legacy tool design creation. [[#3137](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3137)]

#### Dependency Updates
- Updated `ModelContextProtocol` packages to `2.0.0-preview.3`. [[#3145](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3145)]

### Fixed

- `sql database create` and `sql database update` now return a validation error for unrecognized `--read-scale` values instead of silently ignoring them. [[#3129](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3129)]

## 3.0.29 (2026-07-23) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added Azure IoT Hub integration updates including command docs, e2e prompts, README service coverage, consolidated tool mapping, and CODEOWNERS ownership. [[#3005](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3005)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Quota tools. [[#3066](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3066)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Confidential Ledger tools. [[#3092](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3092)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Compute tools. [[#3096](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3096)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Communication tools. [[#3099](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3099)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Azure Migrate tools. [[#3102](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3102)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Azure ISV tools. [[#3103](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3103)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Advisor tools. [[#3111](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3111)]
- Migrated Azure Terraform tools to new tool pattern. [[#3101](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3101)]
- Migrated Cloud Architect tools to new tool design. [[#3130](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3130)]
- Migrated Azure MCP Server to the MCP 2026-07-28 stateless protocol (SDK 2.0.0-preview.1). HTTP clients using the new protocol must now include `Mcp-Method` and `Mcp-Name` routing headers on every POST request. Clients on the previous 2025-11-25 protocol are unaffected — the server auto-negotiates backward compatibility. [[#3016](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3016)]
- Added a server usage rule instructing agents to consult the troubleshooting guide (https://aka.ms/azmcp/troubleshooting) when an Azure MCP tool call fails, including retrying with the correct `tenant` and/or `subscription` parameter for authentication, authorization, tenant, or subscription context errors. [[#3054](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3054)]

### Fixed

- Properly pass `tenant` and `retry options` in Azure Migrate tools. [[#3102](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3102)]
- Authenticated commands now return a clear, actionable error message when Azure credentials are unavailable (CredentialUnavailableException), guiding users to run `az login` instead of surfacing a generic authentication failure. [[#3056](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3056)]

## 3.0.28 (2026-07-21) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Speech tools. [[#3060](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3060)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Workbooks tools. [[#3050](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3050)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Well Architected Framework tools. [[#3047](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3047)]

- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Pricing tools. [[#3067](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3067)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Policy tools. [[#3068](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3068)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from MySql tools. [[#3069](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3069)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Marketplace tools. [[#3070](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3070)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Managed Lustre tools. [[#3078](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3078)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Load Testing tools. [[#3079](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3079)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Key Vault tools. [[#3080](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3080)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Grafana tools. [[#3081](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3081)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Function App tools. [[#3083](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3083)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Extension tools. [[#3085](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3085)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Event Hubs tools. [[#3086](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3086)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Event Grid tools. [[#3087](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3087)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Device Registry tools. [[#3088](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3088)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Deploy tools. [[#3090](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3090)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Container Apps tools. [[#3091](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3091)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Bicep Schema tools. [[#3100](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3100)]
- Migrated Function tools to new design. [[#3082](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3082)]
- Modernized MCP tool `inputSchema` generation to use `System.Text.Json.Schema.JsonSchemaExporter` instead of the previous reflection-based mapper. Emitted input schemas are now richer and more spec-accurate: object roots always include `additionalProperties: false`, `Guid` options use `format: "uuid"`, nullable value types are typed as `["<type>", "null"]`, and nested object/array options produce full nested schemas. [[#2995](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2995)]

### Fixed

- Updated option binding to use more appropriate arity choices based on multi-value parameters (arrays), single-value parameters (anything but boolean flags), and flags (boolean flags). [[#3047](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3047)]

## 3.0.27 (2026-07-16) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Search tools. [[#2954](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2954)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Sql tools. [[#2956](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2956)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from SignalR tools. [[#3061](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3061)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Service Fabric tools. [[#3062](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3062)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Service Bus tools. [[#3063](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3063)]

## 3.0.26 (2026-07-14) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `azmcp insights get` command to derive infrastructure insights from Azure Resource Graph aggregation combined with MCP sampling. [[#2711](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2711)]

### Changed

#### Dependency Updates
- Updated `@microsoft/vscode-azext-utils` from ~2 to ~4 (4.1.1) and `@vscode/vsce` from 3.7.1 to 3.9.2 in the VS Code extension. [[#3001](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3001)]

### Fixed

- Unrecognized `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` values (e.g. typos) now log a warning listing valid values instead of silently falling back to the default credential chain. [[#3001](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3001)]
- Fixed a thread-safety issue in CustomChainedCredential where concurrent calls to GetToken/GetTokenAsync before initialization could construct duplicate credential chains. The credential is now initialized via `Lazy<T> (ExecutionAndPublication)` to guarantee single initialization under concurrent access. [[#3001](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3001)]

## 3.0.25 (2026-07-10) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Replaced the broken `monitor healthmodels entity get` command with `monitor healthmodels list` and `monitor healthmodels get`. [[#2979](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2979)]
- Added Claude Code installation instructions to the Azure MCP Server README, covering installation of the Azure plugin from Anthropic's official plugin marketplace. [[#3003](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/3003)]

## 3.0.24 (2026-07-08) (pre-release)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the on-behalf-of token tenant comparison was case-sensitive, causing valid requests to be rejected when the configured tenant ID casing differed from the JWT 'tid' claim. [[#2907](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2907)]

## 3.0.23 (2026-07-02) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added the `resilience` toolset (Azure Resilience Management) with read-only `get` commands for goals (templates, assignments, resources), usage plans and enrollments, and recovery plans (plans, resources, jobs). [[#2948](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2948)]
- Added support for AVM pattern modules (`avm-ptn-*`) in the Azure Terraform `avm` tools. The `azureterraform avm list` tool now returns both resource and pattern modules, each tagged with a `moduleType` field, and `avm versions`/`avm get` work for pattern modules as well as resource modules. [[#2946](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2946)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Resource Health tools. [[#2952](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2952)]

## 3.0.22 (2026-06-30) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from tools in the following namespaces:
  - App Configuration [[#2871](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2871)]
  - App Service [[#2875](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2875)]
  - Authorization [[#2885](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2885)]
  - Azure Backup [[#2888](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2888)]
  - Cosmos DB [[#2935](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2935)]
  - Kusto [[#2922](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2922)]
  - Monitor [[#2940](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2940)]
  - SRE Agent [[#2937](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2937)]
  - Storage [[#2922](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2922)]
  - Virtual Desktop [[#2941](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2941)]
  - PostgreSQL [[#2942](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2942)]
  - Foundry Extensions [[#2949](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2949)]
  - Storage Sync [[#2950](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2950)]
- **Breaking:** Parameters `--label` and `--label-filter` are now mutually exclusive in `appconfig kv get`. [[#2871](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2871)]

### Fixed

- Fixed handling of nullable numeric options in Foundry Extensions tools. They were previously being ignored due to a type mismatch between the `System.CommandLine` Option definition type and the retrieval type. [[#2949](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2949)]
- Fixed missing `--tags` option in the `storagesync service create` tool. [[#2950](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2950)]
- `eventhubs namespace-get` now correctly supports subscription-wide listing when `--resource-group` is omitted, and treats a whitespace resource group as not provided for robust scope handling. [[#2961](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2961)]
- `foundryextensions resource-get` routing and terminology were clarified to improve namespace tool selection confidence, and validation now fails fast when `--resource-name` is provided without `--resource-group`. [[#2961](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2961)]

## 3.0.21 (2026-06-23) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `azmcp advisor recommendation summary` command to aggregate recommendations server-side grouped by `recommendation-type`, `category`, `impact`, or `resource-type`. `--group-by` is optional and defaults to `category` when omitted, surfacing the high-level themes (Cost, Security, Reliability, etc.). Returns the full per-bucket count and a true `TotalRecommendations` over the filtered population. Optional `--top` is a presentation cap on the number of displayed buckets (defaults to all); the `Unknown` bucket is always pushed to the tail and preserved across slicing so uncategorized items remain visible. Added optional `--category`, `--impact`, `--resource-type`, `--resource`, and `--search` filters to both `azmcp advisor recommendation list` and `azmcp advisor recommendation summary`; `--search` supports natural-language phrases like 'related to Microsoft Foundry'. Both commands now return only active recommendations (status 'New'), excluding dismissed and postponed ones. Also added `--top` to `azmcp advisor recommendation list`. [[#2732](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2732)]
- Added `azmcp advisor recommendation-type list` to list the catalog of Advisor recommendation types via the ARM Advisor metadata API. Each entry surfaces the recommendation's category, impact level, target resource type, and sub-category. Results are sorted by impact (High → Medium → Low). Supports optional filters `--resource-type`, `--impact`, and `--category`. Useful both for greenfield (empty environments) and brownfield (onboarding new resource types) scenarios. [[#2830](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2830)]
- Added an optional `--schema` parameter to `azmcp postgres list` for listing tables in non-public PostgreSQL schemas (defaults to `public`), and removed unused `--subscription`/`--resource-group` parameters from the PostgreSQL data-plane commands: `database query`, `table schema get`. [[#2864](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2864)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed auth mode from `aks_cluster_get` and `aks_nodepool_get` tools as they don't use that parameter. [[#2868](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2868)]
- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from App Lens tools. [[#2872](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2872)]
- Improved resource querying in Aks tools. [[#2852](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2852)]
- Clarified the `azmcp redis create` tool description to convey that provisioning is asynchronous and callers should poll `provisioningState` until it shows 'Succeeded' before connecting. [[#2863](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2863)]

### Fixed

- Cap `azmcp postgres list` database and table results at 10,000 entries to prevent unbounded enumeration on large servers. When the results are truncated, the response includes a `resultsTruncated: true` flag. [[#2920](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2920)]
- Fixed the SQL `db get` and `elastic-pool list` tools returning resources from every server in the resource group, or a database from the wrong server, instead of only the requested server. Listing databases, listing elastic pools, and retrieving a single database by name are now scoped to the specified server. [[#2865](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2865)]
- Fixed Azure SQL tools failing with a cryptic ARM error when a subscription display name (instead of a subscription ID) was provided. The `sql server show`, `sql server list`, `sql server create`, and `sql db rename` operations now resolve the subscription through the subscription service. [[#2861](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2861)]

## 3.0.20 (2026-06-18) (pre-release)

### Fixed

- Changed the default HTTP status code for command validation failures (`CommandValidationException`) from 500 (Internal Server Error) to 400 (Bad Request). [[#2900](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2900)]

- Optimized `BaseAzureResourceService.ExecuteResourceQueryAsync` to reduce ARM calls from two to one in the success path. [[#2735](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2735)]



## 3.0.19 (2026-06-16) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed unused parameters from Application Insights tools. [[#2874](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2874)]
- Added documentation for KQL query validation restrictions (max 10,000 characters, tautology pattern rejection, management/control command rejection) for `azmcp kusto query`, `azmcp monitor resource log query`, and `azmcp monitor workspace log query`. [[#2814](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2814)]

### Fixed

- Fixed several issues in the MySQL toolset: [[#2677](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2677)]
  - `azmcp mysql list` now works when `--resource-group` is omitted. It now lists all MySQL servers across the subscription using a single ARM API call, matching the behavior of the PostgreSQL toolset.
  - `--user` is no longer required for ARM-only commands (`server config get`, `server param get`, `server param set`). It is now only required for commands that open a direct database connection (`database query`, `table schema get`).
  - Resource-group and parameter not-found errors now return HTTP 404 instead of HTTP 500, enabling callers to distinguish missing resources from unexpected failures.
  - The query safety validator's compiled regex is now initialized once at startup rather than on every call, improving performance and ensuring AOT compatibility.
- Fixed PostgreSQL server configuration commands (`server config get`, `server param get`, `server param set`) to honor the `--tenant` and retry policy options when making ARM calls, enabling sovereign cloud authentication and configurable retries. [[#2862](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2862)]
- Added Azure OpenAI endpoint validation to the Cosmos DB vector search tool (`cosmos_database_container_item_vector-search`). [[#2895](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2895)]
- Fixed Redis `list` failing with a `NullReferenceException` when a cache has no Redis configuration (common for Basic/Standard tier caches), which previously caused all caches to be dropped from the response. Not-found errors (e.g. subscription or resource group not found) now return a 404 status instead of 500. [[#2886](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2886)]
- Fixed `azureterraform_azapi_get` returning `500 InternalServerError` for invalid resource type or API version inputs. The tool now returns `400 BadRequest` with an actionable message, enabling agents to auto-correct and retry with valid inputs. [[#2657](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2657)]

## 3.0.18 (2026-06-12) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added an optional `--resource-group` parameter to `azmcp cosmos list` so account listing is scoped to the resource group and Cosmos DB account key lookups resolve the account directly instead of enumerating every account in the subscription. [[#2839](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2839)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Event Hubs namespace create/update now rejects invalid `--sku-tier` values with a validation error instead of silently defaulting to Standard. [[#2678](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2678)]
- **Breaking:** Removed auth mode from `acr_registry_list` and `acr_registry_repository_list` tools as they don't use that parameter. [[#2825](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2825)]

### Fixed

- Fixed multiple issues in the EventHubs toolset:
  - Namespace delete now reports "not found" instead of "deleted successfully" when the namespace does not exist.
  - Event Hub status values are now matched case-insensitively, and `--status` is correctly applied when updating. Previously it was accepted but silently discarded. [[#2678](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2678)]
- Fixed an issue where the Cosmos DB QueryItems operation silently parsed non-success (e.g. throttled or auth-failure) responses as data. The response is now validated before parsing so failures surface as errors. [[#2836](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2836)]
- Fixed Cosmos DB account lookup to use case-insensitive name matching and return a 404 (KeyNotFoundException) instead of a generic error when an account is not found. [[#2839](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2839)]
- Fixed an issue where a valid subscription name or ID containing the words `subscription` or `default` could be incorrectly treated as a placeholder value and replaced with the default subscription. [[#2849](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2849)]
- Azure Backup: Replace InvalidOperationException with ArgumentException/KeyNotFoundException for user-input validation errors so the telemetry classifier correctly categorizes them as Customer errors instead of MCP Tool Bugs. [[#2841](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2841)]
- Fixed `azurebackup_vault_list` and `azurebackup_governance_find-unprotected` so that when both the RSV and DPP backends fail with `RequestFailedException`, a single `RequestFailedException` is surfaced (preserving the HTTP status and combining both error messages) instead of an `InvalidOperationException`. This ensures the failure is correctly classified as an Azure service error rather than an MCP-side bug. [[#2805](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2805)]
- Fixed `azurebackup_policy_get` and `azurebackup_policy_list` (DPP vaults) failing with `FormatException` from `XmlConvert.ToTimeSpan` when policies contain ISO 8601 duration values that the Azure SDK cannot parse (e.g. fractional seconds, week designators in retention rules). `policy_list` now skips policies that the SDK cannot parse and returns the rest; `policy_get` falls back to listing the vault's policies and matching by name. Tracks the Azure SDK gap in `Azure.ResourceManager.DataProtectionBackup`. [[#2805](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2805)]

## 3.0.17 (2026-06-09) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed resource group, tenant, auth method, and retry options from `cloudarchitect_design` tool as they aren't used. [[#2822](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2822)]

### Fixed

- Fixed Cosmos DB query validator to use a cached static Regex instead of recompiling a new Regex on every validation, improving performance and AOT compatibility. [[#2834](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2834)]
- Fixed Cosmos DB cache keys to include subscription, tenant, and authentication method. [[#2838](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2838)]
- Replaced misleading error logging in `CosmosListCommand`, removing the always-null `ResourceGroup` field and adding non-sensitive diagnostic context (Subscription, Account, Database) consistent with `MySqlListCommand` and `PostgresListCommand`. [[#2837](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2837)]
- Fixed AVM `module-not-found` errors returning HTTP 422 instead of 400 by using `ArgumentException` for invalid module names. [[#2676](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2676)]

## 3.0.16 (2026-06-01) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Changed server property names in `appsettings.json` to be scoped to `MicrosoftMcp` instead of the root level. [[#2779](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2779)]

## 3.0.15 (2026-05-29) (pre-release)

### Fixed

- Fixed trimmed/package runtime option binding failures for tools like Kusto query/sample by preserving public parameterless constructors required for reflection-based option activation. [[#2773](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2773)]

## 3.0.14 (2026-05-28) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added a new `advisor recommendation apply` tool that helps in applying Azure Advisor recommendations to IaC files (ARM, Terraform) by returning rules. [[#2686](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2686)]
- Added five Azure Cosmos DB MCP tools: [[#2644](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2644)]
  - `cosmos database container schema infer`: Infer container schema by sampling documents
  - `cosmos database container item list-recent`: Return the most recently modified documents
  - `cosmos database container item get`: Look up a document by id, with optional partition key for point reads
  - `cosmos database container item text-search`: `FullTextContains`-based property search
  - `cosmos database container item vector-search`: `VectorDistance` similarity search using Azure OpenAI-generated embeddings

### Changed

- **Breaking:** The `compute vm delete` and `compute vmss delete` tools now return a not-found outcome (`Success: false`) when the target resource does not exist, instead of reporting a successful deletion. This may affect automation that previously treated non-existent VM/VMSS deletions as success. [[#2687](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2687)]
- We now emit the `AzSubscriptionGuid` telemetry tag from each Azure Backup tool so per-subscription telemetry works in namespace server mode. [[#2734](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2734)]
- Centralized KQL query safety validation in `Azure.Mcp.Core`. This validation is now enforced for all Monitor log/workspace query execution paths, preventing unsafe tautology and management-tool patterns. [[#2747](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2747)]
- Changed the `SslMode` in PostgreSQL tools to `Require` instead of the default `Prefer` to align with other tools like those in the MySQL namespace. [[#2749](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2749)]
- Expanded the Azure MCP `enabledServices` namespace options to include currently registered Azure tool namespaces and removed legacy `azuremanagedlustre` alias. [[#2758](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2758)]
- Added more validations to the `compute vm create` and `compute vmss create` tools. [[#2764](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2764)]
- The `appconfig kv delete` tool response now includes an `existed` field (`true` if the key was present and deleted, `false` if it was already absent) and a human-readable `message`, allowing callers to distinguish a successful deletion from a no-op on a non-existent key. [[#2683](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2683)]

### Fixed

- Fixed issues for the following tools:
  - Azure App Configuration: [[#2683](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2683)]
    - The user-supplied `--retry-policy` is now applied to all data-plane key-value operations for **App Configuration** (`kv get`, `kv set`, `kv delete`, `kv lock`); previously it was only applied to the ARM store-discovery call, causing custom retry settings to have no effect on actual configuration reads and writes.
  - Azure Backup: [[#2726](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2726)]
    - Reject unknown `--workload-type` values for `protectableitem list` at the tool boundary with a `400` `ValidationError` instead of leaking a `500` `ArgumentException` from the service layer.
    - When both RSV and DPP vault listings fail (in `vault get` without `--vault-type` and in `governance find-unprotected`), the server now surfaces a single meaningful exception instead of leaking a raw `AggregateException`.
    - Resolve subscription name to subscription ID via `ISubscriptionService` before constructing ARM `ResourceIdentifier`s, so every tool now accepts a subscription display name in `--subscription` instead of failing with `FormatException`.
  - Azure Compute: [[#2687](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2687)]
    - `vm update` and `vmss update` now correctly clear all tags when `--tags ''` is passed.
    - `DetermineOsType` now uses word-boundary token matching: it no longer misidentifies images with 'win' mid-word (e.g., 'twin-ubuntu') as Windows, and now correctly identifies Visual Studio on Windows images (e.g., 'vs-2022-comm-latest-win11-n-gen2') as Windows.
  - Azure Event Grid: [[#2753](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2753)]
    - Corrected the `topic list` tool description to remove unsupported claims related to access keys and requiring a topic/subscription.
  - Azure Service Bus: [[#2680](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2680)]
    - The `--subscription` option was incorrectly required on `queue details`, `topic details`, and `topic subscription details` and has been removed since the namespace FQDN is sufficient for authentication.
    - `topic details` incorrectly returned "Subscription not found" when a topic did not exist; the error message now correctly reads "Topic not found".
    - Malformed namespace names (containing path separators or other invalid characters) raised a `SecurityException`; they now raise an `ArgumentException` to correctly signal invalid input rather than a security violation.

## 3.0.13 (2026-05-26) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added a new namespace for Azure SRE Agent (`Microsoft.App/SREAgentPreview`) tools with 55 commands across 11 sub-groups: agents, skills, connectors, hooks, threads, scheduledtasks, incidents, workflows, docs, architecture, and commonprompts. Supports listing/creating/updating SRE Agent resources, managing sub-agents and tools, registering data connectors (Kusto/MCP), configuring safety hooks, running investigations, scheduling tasks, declaring incidents, generating workflows, querying memories, and producing remediation plans against the SRE Agent data plane. [[#2611](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2611)]

### Fixed

- Fixed three bugs in `storage account create`: [[#2674](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2674)]
  - Subscription display names (e.g. "My Subscription") now resolve correctly instead of failing with a FormatException — consistent with all other storage commands.
  - The `--access-tier` option now documents all valid values (Hot, Cool, Cold, Premium); Cold and Premium were silently accepted but never listed, making them undiscoverable.
  - The `--sku` option description now clarifies that `storage account create` creates StorageV2 accounts and defaults to Standard_LRS if no SKU is specified.
- Fixed `ArgumentNullException` in `azurebackup_backup_status` for DPP-only ARM resource types (e.g. Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts, AKS, Disk, Blob). The implicit string-to-BackupDataSourceType conversion is now bypassed via an explicit nullable cast so unmapped types correctly route through the DPP vault lookup. [[#2724](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2724)]

## 3.0.12 (2026-05-22) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added a new `--nfs-encryption-in-transit` option to File Shares `create`/`update` tools. [[#2648](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2648)]

### Fixed

- Updated Container App tools to accept a `--tenant` parameter. [[#2702](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2702)]
- Fixed not-found conditions in `SubscriptionService`, `TenantService`, and `ResourceGroupService` returning HTTP `500`/`400` instead of HTTP `404`. [[#2703](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2703)]
- Updated App Lens tools to return a response with a "resource not found" message instead of throwing an exception when no resource matches the given name, so telemetry no longer reports these expected cases as tool failures. [[#2700](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2700)]
- Fixed issues in Key Vault tools: [[#2671](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2671)]
  - `keyvault admin settings get` now correctly applies the default retry policy
  - `keyvault certificate import` now returns HTTP status code `400` for invalid certificate data instead of `500`
  - `keyvault key create` now accepts the correct valid types (RSA, RSA-HSM, EC, EC-HSM) for the `--key-type` parameter
  - `keyvault key list` now includes all keys (managed and non-managed) when `--include-managed` is `true` instead of returning only managed keys

## 3.0.11 (2026-05-20) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added a tool for managing VM power state (start/stop/restart/deallocate) called `compute_vm_power-state`. [[#2498](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2498)]
- Overhauled the `azurebackup_policy_create` tool with comprehensive schedule, retention, archive tiering, and advanced backup capabilities across RSV and DPP vaults, including 38+ new flags, a pre-flight `PolicyCreateValidator`, and expanded workload-type alias support. [[#2504](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2504)]
- Added a new tool called `azurebackup_security_configure_encryption` to enable Customer-Managed Key (CMK) encryption on Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults using Azure Key Vault keys. [[#2609](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2609)]
- Added ARM MCP registry integration and exposed ARM MCP tools in Azure MCP so users can discover and invoke ARM-focused capabilities. [[#2571](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2571)]

### Fixed

- Fixed `azurebackup_policy_create` body shapes for DPP vault-tier copy, vaulted Blob/ADLS, SAP HANA snapshot, and RSV smart-tier to match Az CLI and service schemas. Removed unused DPP-only flags. [[#2504](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2504)]
- Improved Azure Resource Health error handling to preserve non-success ARM response details and return clearer guidance for conflict responses such as missing or in-progress `Microsoft.ResourceHealth` provider registration. [[#2577](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2577)]
- Fixed the following Azure Backup issues: [[#2621](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2621)]
  - Fixed a null-reference crash in `azurebackup_backup_status` by adding a null guard in `MapArmResourceTypeToBackupDataSourceType`
  - Fixed `azurebackup_governance_find-unprotected` to support nested ARM resource types (e.g., `Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases`) by relaxing the resource type regex from single-segment to multi-segment
  - Fixed the following RSV-backed Azure Backup tools to accept subscription names (in addition to IDs) by removing the GUID-only `ValidateSubscriptionFormat` check that violated MCP conventions:
    - `azurebackup_vault_create`
    - `azurebackup_vault_get`
    - `azurebackup_vault_update`
    - `azurebackup_policy_create`
    - `azurebackup_policy_get`
    - `azurebackup_protecteditem_protect`
    - `azurebackup_protecteditem_get`
    - `azurebackup_protecteditem_undelete`
    - `azurebackup_protectableitem_list`
    - `azurebackup_job_get`
    - `azurebackup_recoverypoint_get`
    - `azurebackup_governance_immutability`
    - `azurebackup_governance_soft-delete`
    - `azurebackup_disasterrecovery_enable-crr`
  - Fixed serialization issue in `azurebackup_job_get` by handling `FormatException`s thrown from the Azure SDK's `XmlConvert.ToTimeSpan` in `DppBackupOperations.ListJobsAsync`
  - Fixed telemetry tags not being emitted by returning `"auto"`/`"unspecified"` instead of `null` for unset values, since `Activity.AddTag(key, null)` is a no-op in .NET\
- Removed restrictions on what kinds of web sites the AppLens tool can diagnose. [[#2596](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2596)]

## 3.0.10 (2026-05-07) (pre-release)

### Changed

- Fixed `PluginTelemetryCommand` tool name validation to use the host-created CommandFactory, ensuring the full registered tool set is validated correctly. [[#2583](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2583)]
- Improved MSAL exception handling by capturing richer PII-safe telemetry details and mapping `MsalServiceException` and `MsalClientException` more accurately. [[#2587](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2587)]

## 3.0.9 (2026-05-05) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `azurebackup security configure-mua` command to enable or disable Multi-User Authorization on Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. [[#2544](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2544)]
- Added `Win2022Datacenter1P` image alias for the first-party shared gallery Windows Server 2022 image (`/sharedGalleries/WINDOWSSERVER.1P/images/2022-DATACENTER-AZURE-EDITION/versions/latest`) that does not require a marketplace purchase plan. [[#2533](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2533)]
- Added `Ubuntu2604` image alias for `azmcp vm create` mapping to marketplace URN `Canonical:ubuntu-26_04-lts:server:latest`. [[#2533](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2533)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Updated `azmcp compute vm create` and `azmcp compute vmss create` to require the `--image` parameter, removing the default `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS` image when omitted. Users must now specify an alias, Marketplace URN, or shared gallery image ID. [[#2533](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2533)]
- **Breaking:** Changed `Win2022Datacenter` image alias to use the `WindowsServer2022` marketplace offer instead of the deprecated `WindowsServer` offer. [[#2533](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2533)]
- **Breaking:** Removed the `Win2019Datacenter` image alias, use the marketplace URN format (`MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2019-datacenter-gensecond:latest`) directly if Windows Server 2019 is needed. [[#2533](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2533)]
- **Breaking:** Removed the `Ubuntu2004` image alias from `azmcp vm create`. `Ubuntu 20.04` LTS reached end of standard support on May 31, 2025 and is no longer recommended for new VMs. Use `Ubuntu2204` or `Ubuntu2404`, or specify the Marketplace URN (`Canonical:0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal:20_04-lts-gen2:latest`) if `Ubuntu 20.04` is still required. [[#2533](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2533)]
- Optimized CLI startup time for targeted command invocations by ~39% (945ms to 573ms). [[#2569](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2569)]

## 3.0.8 (2026-05-01) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `appservice_webapp_change-state` tool to change the running state of an App Service web app. [[#1934](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1934)]

### Fixed

- Improved Resource Health availability status errors for unsupported resource types. [[#2554](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2554)]
- Fixed parameter handling to honor the optional `--resource-group` parameter, which was previously not passed through to the service layer, causing subscription-wide results to always be returned regardless of the specified resource group for the following tools: [[#2552](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2552)]
  - `appconfig_account_list`
  - `grafana_list`
  - `kusto_cluster_list`
  - `monitor_workspace_list`
  - `search_service_list`
  - `storage_account_get`
- Fixed issue where exceptions written to stdout were incorrectly interpreted as JSON RPC response. [[#2559](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2559)]

### Changed

- Improved Azure Functions tool descriptions and prompts for better AI agent tool selection and invocation. [[#2517](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2517)]

## 3.0.7 (2026-04-30) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `azurebackup_policy_update` command for modifying RSV backup policy schedule and retention settings. [[#2452](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2452)]

### Fixed

- Fixed CLI mode log messages being written to stdout instead of stderr, ensuring agents and pipelines consuming stdout receive clean JSON only. Logs can be viewed with `2>&1` or captured separately using `2> file.log`. [[#2535](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2535)]

### Changed

- Fixed telemetry-triaged failures by hardening input validation and null handling as well as by migrating RSV soft-delete and cross-region restore to supported Vault Patch APIs. [[#2518](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2518)]

## 3.0.6 (2026-04-28) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added Azure Terraform toolset with 10 tools: AzureRM and AzAPI provider documentation, Azure Verified Modules listing/versions/documentation, aztfexport resource/resource group/query export, and conftest workspace/plan policy validation: [[#2382](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2382)]
  - `azureterraform_azurerm_get`
  - `azureterraform_azapi_get`
  - `azureterraform_avm_list`
  - `azureterraform_avm_versions`
  - `azureterraform_avm_get`
  - `azureterraform_aztfexport_resource`
  - `azureterraform_aztfexport_resourcegroup`
  - `azureterraform_aztfexport_query`
  - `azureterraform_conftest_workspace`
  - `azureterraform_conftest_plan`
- Updated Marketplace tool to use API version 2025-05-01 and added new response model fields: `offerId`, `mixProductId`, `offeringType`, `licenseManagementType`, `hasRIPlans`, `leadGeneration`, and `experienceConfig`. [[#2502](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2502)]
- Added learn-mode discovery for azmcp commands. AI agents can use the azmcp CLI `--learn` flag, and MCP tool flows surface the same command and parameter discovery behavior without executing Azure operations. [[#2455](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2455)]

### Fixed

- Fixed `azurebackup vault create --vault-type dpp` to enable a system-assigned managed identity by default, preventing subsequent `protecteditem protect` failures with `VaultMSIUnauthorized` (existing vaults unaffected; use `azurebackup vault update --identity-type SystemAssigned` if needed). [[#2470](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2470)]
- Fixed `azurebackup protecteditem protect` to return the real protect outcome (instead of a synthetic `Accepted` + non-resolvable base64 job id): RSV now polls the underlying `ConfigureBackup` job to a terminal state and returns its actual status (`Completed`, `CompletedWithWarnings`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`, or `InProgress` if polling exceeds the budget) plus error details; DPP now waits for completion, reads back the backup instance, returns the actual `protectionStatus` (e.g., `ProtectionConfigured`), and no longer includes a misleading `jobId` (use `azurebackup protecteditem get`/`list` to verify). [[#2470](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2470)]
- Fixed RSV IaaS VM protection in `azurebackup protecteditem protect` by submitting the protect request directly (removing the 180s container-discovery pre-poll), preventing timeouts for newly created VMs and matching `az backup protection enable-for-vm` behavior. [[#2470](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2470)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Updated Marketplace `product_get` by removing `--market` and `--pricing-audience` (now fetched from the subscription), renaming `ProductsListResponse` fields (`Items` → `Value`, `NextPageLink` → `NextLink`), and changing `Badge`, `ProductType`, and `PricingAudience` from enums to strings. [[#2502](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2502)]
- Added an automated end-to-end (E2E) testing tool that uses the GitHub Copilot SDK to validate Azure MCP tool invocations from prompt fixtures. [[#1830](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1830)]
- Improved deploy tool invocation by rewriting tool descriptions and defaulting previously required options, and restricted `deploy_app_logs_get` to local-only mode (`LocalRequired=true`). [[#2418](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2418)]
- Added custom telemetry dimensions to Azure Backup MCP commands. [[#2505](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2505)]

## 2.0.2 (2026-04-24)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Renamed `--detector-name` parameter to `--detector-id` in `appservice_webapp_diagnostic_diagnose` command to accurately reflect that the parameter expects a detector ID, not a display name. [[#2469](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2469)]

### Fixed

- Fixed App Service `diagnostic_list` returning detector display names instead of detector IDs, causing `diagnostic_diagnose` to fail with 404 Not Found errors. [[#2469](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2469)]

## 3.0.5 (2026-04-23) (pre-release)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Changed default VM size for `vm create` and `vmss create` commands from `Standard_DS1_v2` (older generation) to `Standard_D2s_v5` (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, D-series v5) [[#2415](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2415)]
- **Breaking:** Renamed `--detector-name` parameter to `--detector-id` in `appservice_webapp_diagnostic_diagnose` command to accurately reflect that the parameter expects a detector ID, not a display name. [[#2458](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2458)]
- Added a `-Verify` flag to `Update-Solution.ps1` that checks whether `.slnx` solution files are up to date without overwriting them, and integrated this verification into `Analyze-Code.ps1` so stale solution files are caught before merge. [[#2430](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2430)]

### Fixed

- Fixed App Service `diagnostic_list` returning detector display names instead of detector IDs, causing `diagnostic_diagnose` to fail with 404 Not Found errors. [[#2458](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2458)]

## 3.0.4 (2026-04-21) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added Azure Backup toolset for vault management, backup policies, protection, jobs, recovery points, governance, and disaster recovery. Tools added: `azurebackup_vault_get`, `azurebackup_vault_create`, `azurebackup_vault_update`, `azurebackup_policy_get`, `azurebackup_policy_create`, `azurebackup_protecteditem_get`, `azurebackup_protecteditem_protect`, `azurebackup_protectableitem_list`, `azurebackup_backup_status`, `azurebackup_job_get`, `azurebackup_recoverypoint_get`, `azurebackup_governance_find-unprotected`, `azurebackup_governance_immutability`, `azurebackup_governance_soft-delete`, `azurebackup_disasterrecovery_enable-crr`. [[#2116](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2116)]
- Added a new `azurebackup protecteditem undelete` command that restores soft-deleted backup items to an active protection state for both RSV (Recovery Services vault) and DPP (Data Protection) vault types. [[#2441](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2441)]

### Fixed

- Added validation in `SearchService.GetSearchEndpoint` to prevent URL injection if called without prior `ValidateServiceName` check. [[#2420](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2420)]
- Fixed `compute_vmss_update` tool returning HTTP 400 when only `--capacity`, `--overprovision`, or `--enable-auto-os-upgrade` is provided by correcting option type definitions to use nullable types. [[#2421](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2421)]

## 3.0.3 (2026-04-16) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added prefix support to `storage_blob_get` and `storage_blob_container_get`. [[#2378](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2378)]

### Fixed

- Restored non-sensitive diagnostic context (Subscription, ResourceGroup, Server, Database) to error logging in `MySqlListCommand` and `PostgresListCommand`, replacing the previous `{@Options}` pattern that could leak credentials such as the PostgreSQL Password field. [[#2393](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2393)]

## 3.0.2 (2026-04-14) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `--output` option to functions template get command with New (default) and Add values for controlling template file output. [[#2178](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2178)]
- Added `--disable-caching` to server start options to disable caching. [[#2330](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2330)]
- Added endpoint validation for Service Bus namespace parameter to ensure it resolves to a valid Azure Service Bus domain. [[#2347](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2347)]

### Changed

- Enhanced the description for the main Azure Monitor command group to provide a more comprehensive overview of its capabilities and usage. [[#2325](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2325)]
- Added query parameterization for SQL-based tools (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cosmos DB) and input sanitization for KQL-based tools (Kusto, Monitor, Deploy), with shared helpers in Microsoft.Mcp.Core. [[#2355](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2355)]

### Fixed

- Fixed endpoint validation on non-Public cloud environments. [[#2320](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2320)]
- Replaced structured logging of entire options objects with explicit non-sensitive identifiers in error log statements across all commands. [[#2334](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2334)]
- Added URI validation for disk creation source parameter to enforce HTTPS and Azure Blob Storage endpoints. [[#2335](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2335)]
- Added input validation for Azure Storage account names in StorageService. [[#2348](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2348)]
- Allowed KQL comments (//) and let statements (;) in Kusto query validation. Management commands and tautologies remain blocked. [[#2385](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2385)]

## 2.0.1 (2026-04-14)

### Fixed

- Allowed KQL comments (//) and let statements (;) in Kusto query validation. Management commands and tautologies remain blocked. [[#2387](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2387)]

### Other Changes since 1.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

**Tool Consolidation:** Numerous related tools were consolidated for a more streamlined tool surface:

- **Cosmos DB/MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Consolidated **list** commands:
    - Removed `cosmos account list`, `cosmos database list`, and `cosmos database container list` – use `cosmos list` with the appropriate parameters to route hierarchically
    - Removed `postgres server list`, `postgres database list`, `postgres table list` – use `postgres list` with the appropriate parameters to route hierarchically
    - Removed `mysql server list`, `mysql database list`, `mysql table list` – use `mysql list` with the appropriate parameters to route hierarchically
- **Key Vault**: Merged **get**/**list** tools:
    - Removed `keyvault key list` – use `keyvault key get` without providing a key name to list keys in a key vault
    - Removed `keyvault secret list` – use `keyvault secret get` without providing a secret name to list secrets in a key vault
    - Removed `keyvault certificate list` – use `keyvault certificate get` without providing a certificate name to list certificates in a key vault
- **Monitor WebTest**: Merged **get**/**list** and **create**/**update** tools:
    - Removed `monitor webtests list` – use `monitor webtests get` without providing a WebTest name to list WebTests in a resource group
    - Removed `monitor webtests update` – use `monitor webtests createorupdate` for both create and update scenarios
- **SQL**: Merged **show**/**list** tools:
    - Removed `sql db show` and `sql db list` – use `sql db get` without providing a database name to list databases in a server
    - Removed `sql server show` and `sql server list` – use `sql server get` without providing a server name to list servers in a subscription
- **Load Testing**: Merged **list**/**get** and **create**/**update** tools:
    - Removed `loadtesting testrun list` – use `loadtesting testrun get` without providing a TestRun name to list test runs in a resource group
    - Removed `loadtesting testrun update` – use `loadtesting testrun createorupdate` for both create and update scenarios
- **Resource Health**: Merged **get**/**list** tools:
    - Removed `resourcehealth availability-status list` – use `resourcehealth availability-status get` without providing a resource ID to list availability status for multiple resources

**Namespace, Tool, and Option Renames**:

- **Foundry**: Split the `foundry` namespace into `foundryextensions` for in-process tools and `foundry` for tools proxied from the external Microsoft Foundry MCP server.
  - The following tools were migrated to the external server under new names:
    - `foundry agents list` → `foundry agent get`
    - `foundry agents create` → `foundry agent update`
    - `foundry agents connect` → `foundry agent invoke`
    - `foundry models list` → `foundry model catalog list`
    - `foundry models deploy` → `foundry model deploy`
    - `foundry models deployments list` → `foundry model deployment get`
    - `foundry agents query-and-evaluate` → `foundry evaluation agent batch eval create`
    - `foundry agents evaluate` → `foundry evaluator catalog get`
- **Best Practices**: Renamed the following tools:
  - `get bestpractices get` → `get azure bestpractices get`
  - `get bestpractices ai app` → `get azure bestpractices ai app`
- **Options**: Renamed the following options:
  - Server-wide: `--insecure-disable-elicitation` → `--dangerously-disable-elicitation`
  - Tool listing with `tools list`: `--namespaces` → `--namespace-mode`
  - Getting pipeline deployment guidance with `deploy pipeline guidance get`:
    - `--use-azd-pipeline-config` → `--is-azd-project`,
    - `--azd-iac-options` → `--iac-options`

**Database Security**:

- PostgreSQL tools now require SSL and verify the server's full certificate chain before creating database connections. This SSL mode provides both `eavesdropping protection` and `man-in-the-middle protection`. See [SSL Mode VerifyFull](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/security.html?tabs=tabid-1#encryption-ssltls) for more details.

**Miscellaneous**:

- Removed support for custom URL-based authority hosts in `--cloud`. The option now accepts only well-known cloud names
- Narrowed subscription list response to include only `subscriptionId`, `displayName`, `state`, `tenantId`, and `isDefault`
- Removed the following options for the `deploy pipeline guidance get` tool:
  - `--organization-name`
  - `--repository-name`
  - `--github-environment-name`

#### Bugs Fixed

- Fixed SignalR caching where runtime results were not stored
- Fixed retained-buffer leaks across services and tool loaders
- Fixed Linux stdio watcher regression where using CWD as content root could exhaust `inotify` watchers
- Added regex timeouts and cancellation propagation to prevent hangs

### Fixed

- Added input validation for Azure Storage account names in `StorageService`. [[#2350](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2350)]

## 2.0.38 (2026-04-03) (pre-release)

### Fixed

- Replaced structured logging of entire options objects with explicit non-sensitive identifiers in error log statements across all commands. [[#2336](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2336)]
- Added URI validation for disk creation source parameter to enforce HTTPS and Azure Blob Storage endpoints. [[#2339](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2339)]

## 2.0.37 (2026-04-02) (pre-release)

### Fixed

- Fix endpoint validation on non-Public cloud environments. [[#2322](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2322)]

### Changed

## 2.0.35 (2026-03-30) (pre-release)

### Changed

- Added skill name and tool name validation to the `plugin-telemetry` tool. Skill names are validated against an allowlist to prevent logging of customer-defined custom skill names. Tool names are validated by stripping known client prefixes (Claude Code, VS Code, Copilot CLI) and matching against registered commands or area names, with normalized names logged for consistent telemetry. Added an allowlist for Azure extension tools that are not azmcp commands but still tracked. Expanded the plugin file-reference allowlist with additional azure-enterprise-infra-planner reference paths. [[#2291](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2291)]
- Refactored `PluginTelemetryCommand` to use constructor injection for allowlist providers and lazy resolution of `ICommandFactory` via `IServiceProvider` to avoid circular dependency during startup. [[#2291](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2291)]

### Fixed

- Configured the right audience based on Cloud configuration when creating SDK clients for tools in:
  - AppConfiguration [[#2287](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2287)]
  - Container Registry [[#2286](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2286)]
  - Monitor Query [[#2285](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2285)]
  - Search [[#2283](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2283)]
- Fixed JSON deserialization issues for `resourcehealth` events with timezone-less datetime values. [[#2293](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2293)]

## 2.0.34 (2026-03-27) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added `--dangerously-disable-retry-limits` server start option to bypass retry policy bounds enforcement when explicitly required. [[#2239](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2239)]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed support for custom URL-based authority hosts in the `--cloud` option. The option now accepts only well-known cloud names. Unrecognized values now throw an `ArgumentException` instead of defaulting to the public cloud. Supported values are: [[#2257](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2257)]
  - `AzureCloud`
  - `AzurePublicCloud`
  - `Public`
  - `AzurePublic`
  - `AzureChinaCloud`
  - `China`
  - `AzureChina`
  - `AzureUSGovernment`
  - `AzureUSGovernmentCloud`
  - `USGov`
  - `USGovernment`
- Enforced upper bounds on retry policy values to prevent excessively large retry configurations. [[#2239](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2239)]
- Bumped `@azure/msal-browser` to 5.2.0+ to comply with Component Governance requirements. [[#2260](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2260)]
- Removed references to the non-existent `--public-access-level` parameter from the `storage_blob_container_create` tool description and associated e2e test prompts. [[#2264](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2264)]

### Fixed

- Enforced read-only and HTTP mode restrictions at tool execution time, not just during tool listing. [[#2226](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2226)]
- Improved reliability by adding regex timeouts to prevent hangs, limiting large resource listings, and allowing cancellation to propagate correctly through exception handling. [[#2223](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2223)]
- Fixed Cosmos DB cache key generation to include the authentication method, preventing incorrect client reuse across authentication types. [[#2217](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2217)]
- Fixed validation gap in `BaseAzureResourceService` where the `additionalFilter` parameter could be concatenated into Resource Graph queries without validation. Pipe operators are now rejected. [[#2217](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2217)]
- Added input validation for ledger names in `ConfidentialLedgerService` to ensure only valid characters are accepted. [[#2211](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2211)]
- Fixed elicitation for GitHub Copilot CLI by updating from `UntitledSingleSelectEnumSchema` to `TitledSingleSelectEnumSchema`. [[#2253](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2253)]
- Fixed incorrect SignalR caching where runtime results were not stored in the cache, causing every request to re-fetch instead of returning cached data. [[#2254](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2254)]
- Added `CacheKeyBuilder` to construct cache keys using characters disallowed in Azure resource and subscription names, preventing cache collisions in multi-client remote scenarios. [[#2259](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2259)]
- Added vault name validation in `KeyVaultService` to prevent unsafe input from being interpolated into Key Vault and Managed HSM URIs. [[#2238](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2238)]

## 2.0.33 (2026-03-25) (pre-release)

### Added

- Updated secret elicitation to require explicit user confirmation before proceeding with sensitive operations. [[#2197](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2197)]

### Changed

- Extended elicitations/user consent prompts to cover destructive operations (delete, modify, create) in addition to secret operations, and consolidated both into a single prompt to avoid duplicate confirmation. [[#2208](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2208)]

### Fixed

- Added IPv4 format validation and blocked dangerous IP ranges in the `sql_server_firewall-rule_create` command to prevent overly permissive firewall rules. [[#2206](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2206)]
- Improved `HttpRequestException` handling to return the actual HTTP status code when available instead of defaulting to `503 Service Unavailable`. [[#2200](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2200)]

## 2.0.32 (2026-03-24) (pre-release)

### Added

- Added blocklist validation for security-sensitive PostgreSQL server parameters (audit logging, TLS/SSL, authentication, shared libraries, row-level security) in the `server param set` command to prevent accidental weakening of server security. [[#2164](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2164)]
- Added `--public-network-access` option to the `redis_create` command to control public network access for Azure Managed Redis resources (defaults to disabled). [[#2179](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2179)]

### Changed

- Centralized Foundry and Azure OpenAI endpoint validation using the shared `EndpointValidator` with sovereign cloud support. [[#2162](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2162)]
- Added file path validation and canonicalization for the `speech_stt_recognize` and `speech_tts_synthesize` commands. [[#2162](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2162)]
- Added skill name allowlist validation to the `plugin-telemetry` tool to prevent logging of customer-defined custom skill names, and expanded the plugin file-reference allowlist with additional `azure-enterprise-infra-planner` reference paths. [[#2149](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2149)]
- Removed structured logging of the full options payload from the `sql_server_create` command to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive values. [[#2158](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2158)]
- Updated Docker release pipeline to publish additional minor version tags (e.g., `2.0`, `2.0-amd64`, `2.0-arm64`) allowing consumers to pin to a minor release stream. [[#2144](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2144)]

### Fixed

- Fixed PostgreSQL and MySQL server name validation to require allowed Azure domain suffixes when a fully qualified domain name is provided. [[#2159](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2159)]
- Fixed Cosmos DB credential authentication to strictly honor the requested authentication method instead of falling back to account-key authentication. [[#2162](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2162)]
- Fixed snapshot lookup in the `FileShares` namespace to use exact resource ID matching instead of substring matching. [[#2168](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2168)]
- Improved Cosmos DB query validator to detect a broader range of boolean tautology patterns. [[#2171](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2171)]
- Fixed the `sql_server_create` command to default `--public-network-access` to `Disabled` for secure-by-default server creation. [[#2181](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/2181)]

Incoming authentication uses Entra ID, while outgoing authentication can either use Entra On-Behalf-Of (OBO) or the authentication configured in the host environment. [[#1020](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1020)]
    - Added support for the `--dangerously-disable-http-incoming-auth` command-line option to disable the built-in incoming authentication. Use this option only if you plan to provide your own incoming authentication mechanism, and with caution, as it exposes the server to unauthenticated access. [[#1037](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1037)]
- Enhanced the `tools list` command with new filtering and output options: [[#741](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/741)]
  - Added the `--namespace` option to filter tools by one or more service namespaces (e.g., 'storage', 'keyvault').
  - Added the `--name-only` option to return only tool names without descriptions or metadata.
- Added the following Microsoft Foundry tools: [[#945](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/945)]

- Telemetry:
  - Added `ToolId` into telemetry, based on `IBaseCommand.Id`, a unique GUID for each command. [[#1018](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1018)]
  - Added support for exporting telemetry to OTLP exporters by configuring the environment variable `AZURE_MCP_ENABLE_OTLP_EXPORTER=true`. [[#1018](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1018)]
  - Disabled telemetry for the HTTP transport. [[#1072](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1072)]

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that spawned child processes per namespace for consolidated mode. [[#1002](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1002)]
- Improved the agent learning experience by ignoring the `command` parameter, which resulted in neither learning nor a tool call to happen. Learning is now always invoked when `learn=true` is passed. [[#1057](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/1057)]

### Added

- Added the `--insecure-disable-elicitation` server startup switch. When enabled, the server will bypass user confirmation (elicitation) for tools marked as handling secrets and execute them immediately. This is **INSECURE** and meant only for controlled automation scenarios (e.g., CI or disposable test environments) because it removes a safety barrier that helps prevent accidental disclosure of sensitive data. [[#486](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/486)]
- Enhanced Azure authentication with targeted credential selection via the `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` environment variable: [[#56](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/56)]

  - `"prod"`: Production credentials (Environment → Workload Identity → Managed Identity)
  - Specific credential names (e.g., `"AzureCliCredential"`): Target only that credential
  - Improved Visual Studio Code credential error handling with proper exception wrapping for credential chaining
  - Replaced custom `DefaultAzureCredential` implementation with explicit credential chain for better control and transparency
  - For more details, see [Controlling Authentication Methods with AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#controlling-authentication-methods-with-azure_token_credentials)

- Restored support for the following Key Vault commands: [[#506](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/506)]
  - `azmcp_keyvault_key_get`
  - `azmcp_keyvault_secret_get`

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Redesigned how conditionally required options are handled. Commands now use explicit option registration via extension methods (`.AsRequired()`, `.AsOptional()`) instead of legacy patterns (`UseResourceGroup()`, `RequireResourceGroup()`). [[#452](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/452)]
- **Breaking:** Removed support for the `AZURE_MCP_INCLUDE_PRODUCTION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. Use `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` instead for more flexible credential selection. For migration details, see [Controlling Authentication Methods with AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/servers/Azure.Mcp.Server/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#controlling-authentication-methods-with-azure_token_credentials).

- **Breaking:** Removed Azure CLI (`az`) and Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) extension tools to reduce complexity and focus on native Azure service operations. [[#404](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/404)].

### Fixed

- Marked the `secret` hint of `azmcp_keyvault_secret_create` tool to "true". [[#430](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/pull/430)]
