## Student Tools

These tools provide students with personal academic tracking and organization capabilities using Canvas API's "self" endpoints.

### Self-Identity

Available under **every** role profile (student, educator, all) — these describe only the authenticated caller, so they need no roster permission.

#### `get_my_profile`
Get your own Canvas identity.

**Parameters:** none

**Example:**
```
"Who am I in Canvas?"
"What's my Canvas user ID?"
```

**Returns:** Your Canvas user ID, name, and login ID. `primary_email` and `sis_user_id` are deliberately omitted — neither is needed to identify you to other tools, and both are needlessly sensitive in a transcript.

---

#### `get_my_enrollments`
List the courses **you** are enrolled in, with your role in each.

**Parameters:**
- `include_concluded` (optional): Also include concluded/completed courses (default `false` = active only)

**Example:**
```
"What courses am I in?"
"Am I a student or a TA in BADM 350?"
```

**Returns:** Course code, name, ID, and your role(s) per course. Reports **all** roles when you hold more than one enrollment in a course (e.g. TA and student).

Use this — not [`check_enrollment`](#check_enrollment) — for any question about your own enrollment. `check_enrollment` reads the course roster, which requires roster-admin rights your token probably does not have.

---

### Personal Organization

#### `get_my_upcoming_assignments`
Get your upcoming assignments across all enrolled courses.

**Parameters:**
- `days` (optional): Number of days to look ahead (default: 7)

**Example:**
```
"What assignments do I have due this week?"
"Show me what's due in the next 3 days"
```

**Returns:** List of assignments due within timeframe, sorted by due date, with submission status.

---

#### `get_my_todo_items`
Get your Canvas TODO list including assignments, quizzes, and discussions.

**Example:**
```
"Show me my Canvas TODO list"
"What do I need to do?"
```

**Returns:** All items requiring your attention with due dates and course information.

---

#### `get_my_submission_status`
Check your submission status across assignments.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier` (optional): Specific course code or ID to filter

**Example:**
```
"Have I submitted everything?"
"Show me my submission status for BADM 350"
"What haven't I turned in yet?"
```

**Returns:** Submitted and missing assignments, with overdue items flagged.

---

#### `get_my_submission`
View your own submission for a single assignment, including how many attempts
you have used and any instructor comments.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier` (required): Course code or Canvas ID
- `assignment_id` (required): Canvas assignment ID

**Example:**
```
"Did my essay for BADM 350 go through?"
"How many attempts do I have left on assignment 4821?"
```

**Returns:** Status, submitted time, due and lock dates, attempts used vs allowed,
grade if any, and submission comments.

---

### Student Write Tools

> **Off by default.** These tools only exist if the server operator enabled them
> via `STUDENT_WRITE_TOOLS`, and an instructor can additionally block them in
> their own course. See [Student write configuration](#student-write-configuration).

#### `submit_assignment`
Submit one of your own assignments. **Consumes an attempt.**

This is a deliberate two-call flow. The first call previews and submits nothing;
the second call, carrying the token from the preview, actually submits.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier` (required): Course code or Canvas ID
- `assignment_id` (required): Canvas assignment ID
- `submission_type` (required): `online_text_entry`, `online_url`, or `online_upload`
- `body` (for text entry): The content to submit
- `url` (for URL submissions): The URL
- `file_paths` (for uploads, local servers only): Local file paths, any file type
- `file_contents` (for uploads, hosted servers): `[{"name": ..., "content_base64": ...}]`
- `comment` (optional): A comment to include with the submission
- `confirmation_token` (optional): Token from the preview call; omit to preview

**Example:**
```
"Submit my essay draft to assignment 4821"        → returns a preview
"Yes, submit it"                                   → confirms with the token
```

**Returns:** On the first call, a preview showing the assignment, due and lock
dates, attempts remaining, and exactly what would be sent. On the second, the
submission result including whether Canvas marked it late.

**Files are sent as raw bytes.** Images and PDFs are uploaded as-is, never
converted to text or run through OCR. There is no global list of permitted
extensions: whatever the assignment's own `allowed_extensions` permits is
accepted, so `.heic` photos and `.tex` sources work wherever the instructor
allows them. Limits are 100 MB per file, 100 MB and 20 files per submission.

**Not supported:** group assignments (submitting would bind your whole group) and
quizzes (a separate institutional decision).

---

#### `comment_on_my_submission`
Add a comment to your own submission.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier` (required): Course code or Canvas ID
- `assignment_id` (required): Canvas assignment ID
- `comment` (required): The comment text

**Example:**
```
"Add a note to my submission explaining the late turn-in"
```

---

#### `mark_module_item_done`
Mark a module item complete for yourself, for modules using "mark as done"
requirements.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier` (required): Course code or Canvas ID
- `module_id` (required): Canvas module ID
- `item_id` (required): Canvas module item ID

---

#### Student write configuration

Two independent gates, and the second can only ever narrow the first.

**1. Operator ceiling — `STUDENT_WRITE_TOOLS`**

Comma- or space-separated tool names. Empty (the default) means no student write
tool is registered at all.

```bash
STUDENT_WRITE_TOOLS=submit_assignment,comment_on_my_submission
```

**2. Per-course instructor policy**

An instructor states their course's stance in the course syllabus (the default
carrier, because students cannot edit it):

```
agent_writes: deny
```

or, to allow with limits:

```
agent_writes: allow
allow_tools: submit_assignment
note: Allowed for the weekly labs. Ask me before using it on the final project.
```

`COURSE_AGENT_POLICY_DEFAULT` decides what happens in a course that says nothing:
`deny` (the default, instructors opt in) or `allow` (instructors opt out).

The syllabus is the only supported carrier, and that is deliberate. Students can
read it but cannot edit it, so instructor authorship is structural rather than
assumed. A course-page carrier was built and then removed: a page's
`editing_roles` tells you who may edit it *now*, not who wrote it, so a student
who can create pages could author the policy and set it teacher-only in the same
breath. Authorship cannot be established from a student's own token.

Anything ambiguous denies: a malformed policy, contradictory directives (an
`agent_writes: deny` appended under an earlier `allow`), a failed read, or a
course this caller cannot see.

---

### Academic Performance

#### `get_my_course_grades`
View your current grades across all enrolled courses.

**Example:**
```
"What are my current grades?"
"Show me how I'm doing in all my courses"
```

**Returns:** Current grade, percentage, and enrollment status for each course.

---

### Peer Review Management

#### `get_my_peer_reviews_todo`
List peer reviews you need to complete.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier` (optional): Filter by specific course. Required if `assignment_identifier` is given.
- `assignment_identifier` (optional): Check a specific assignment directly, bypassing the per-course discovery scan. Use this if you know which assignment has your peer review but the general scan doesn't find it.

**Example:**
```
"What peer reviews do I need to complete?"
"Show me my pending peer reviews for ENGL 101"
"Do I have a peer review to do for assignment 4821 in ENGL 101?"
```

**Returns:** Incomplete peer reviews with assignment and course information, each
labeled with its discovery source (`Assignment scan` or `Planner feed`). The
per-course discovery scan (`Assignment scan`) only checks assignments whose
listing carries `peer_reviews: true`; as of #275 it is supplemented with a
Planner API query (`Planner feed`) that mirrors how Canvas's own student
"To Do" list finds pending peer reviews, since the two sources can disagree
on some instances. Results from both are merged and deduplicated.

---

## Educator Tools

These tools provide instructors and TAs with course management, grading, analytics, and communication capabilities.

### Assignment Management

---

### Grading & Rubrics

#### `create_rubric`
Create a new rubric in a course, optionally associating it with an assignment.

Uses bracket-notation form-data encoding required by the Canvas rubric API.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `title`: Rubric title
- `criteria`: JSON string defining criteria (see example below)
- `assignment_id` (optional): Assignment ID to immediately associate the rubric with
- `use_for_grading` (optional): Use rubric for grade calculation when associating (default: false)
- `reusable` (optional): Make rubric reusable across courses (default: false)
- `free_form_criterion_comments` (optional): Allow free-form comments per criterion (default: false)

**Criteria JSON format:**
```json
{
  "c1": {
    "description": "Content Quality",
    "points": 10,
    "ratings": [
      {"description": "Excellent", "points": 10},
      {"description": "Satisfactory", "points": 7},
      {"description": "Needs Work", "points": 3}
    ]
  },
  "c2": {
    "description": "Grammar",
    "points": 5,
    "ratings": [
      {"description": "No errors", "points": 5},
      {"description": "Minor errors", "points": 3}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Example:**
```
"Create a rubric called 'Essay Rubric' in CS101 with two criteria: Content (10 pts) and Grammar (5 pts)"
"Create a rubric and associate it with Assignment 456 for grading"
```

---

#### `create_rubric_from_csv`
Create one or more rubrics in a course from a CSV string using Canvas's native rubric CSV import endpoint. Uploads the CSV, then polls the import job until it reaches a terminal state.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `csv_content`: The CSV content as a string. **A `Rubric Name` column is required** — Canvas rejects the import without it.

**Required CSV format:**

```csv
Rubric Name,Criteria Name,Criteria Description,Criteria Enable Range,Rating Name,Rating Description,Rating Points,Rating Name,Rating Description,Rating Points
Essay Rubric,Clarity,Is the argument clear,false,Excellent,Very clear,10,Poor,Unclear,2
```

Repeat the `Rating Name,Rating Description,Rating Points` triple for each rating level. Use a distinct `Rubric Name` per row to create multiple rubrics in one import.

**Two behaviours worth knowing:**

- **Imported rubrics land in Canvas's `Draft` state and are NOT returned by `list_rubrics`.** They *are* visible in the course's Rubrics page. Do not treat an empty `list_rubrics` result as evidence the import failed.
- Canvas returns `succeeded_with_errors` when the file parses but some rows are rejected. That is a terminal state, not a transient one, and it can mean **zero** rubrics were created — check the reported error messages rather than assuming partial success.

**Example:**
```
"Create a rubric in CS101 from this CSV: Rubric Name,Criteria Name,Criteria Description,Criteria Enable Range,Rating Name,Rating Description,Rating Points / Essay Rubric,Clarity,Is it clear,false,Excellent,Very clear,10"
```

**Note:** CSV-imported rubrics appear in Canvas as **Draft** items. They may not appear immediately in `list_rubrics`; verify imports in the course Rubrics UI.

---

#### `list_rubrics`
List all rubrics in a course.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID

**Example:**
```
"Show me all rubrics in CS101"
```

---

#### `get_rubric`
View rubric criteria and point values. Accepts either a rubric ID or an assignment ID.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `rubric_id` (optional): Rubric ID
- `assignment_id` (optional): Assignment ID (fetches the rubric attached to this assignment)

**Example:**
```
"Show me the rubric for Assignment 4"
"What rubric criteria are in rubric 789?"
```

---

#### `get_rubric_assessment`
View the rubric assessment submitted for a student's submission.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `assignment_id`: Assignment ID
- `student_id`: Student user ID

---

#### `associate_rubric`
Link a rubric to an assignment.

**Parameters:**

- `assignment_id`: Assignment ID
- `rubric_id`: Rubric ID
- `use_for_grading`: Boolean (true/false)

---

#### `grade_with_rubric`
Grade a student submission using a rubric.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `assignment_id`: Assignment ID
- `user_id`: Student ID
- `rubric_assessment`: JSON with criterion ratings

---

#### `bulk_grade_submissions`
Grade multiple submissions concurrently.

**Context use:** Process bulk operations locally without loading every item into the model's context. Actual savings depend on the workload and selected output.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `assignment_id`: Assignment ID
- `grades`: Dictionary mapping user IDs to grade information
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": {
      "rubric_assessment": {...},  // Optional: rubric-based grading
      "grade": <number>,            // Optional: simple grade
      "comment": "<string>"         // Optional: feedback comment
    }
  }
  ```
- `dry_run` (optional): If true, analyze but don't submit grades (default: false)
- `max_concurrent` (optional): Maximum concurrent grading operations (default: 5)
- `rate_limit_delay` (optional): Delay between batches in seconds (default: 1.0)

**Example Usage - Rubric Grading:**
```
"Grade these 3 students using the rubric:
- User 9824: 100 points for criterion _8027 with comment 'Excellent work!'
- User 9825: 75 points for criterion _8027 with comment 'Good work'
- User 9826: 50 points for criterion _8027 with comment 'Needs improvement'"
```

**Example Usage - Simple Grading (no comments):**
```
"Grade these submissions with simple points:
- User 9824: 100 points
- User 9825: 85 points"
```

> **Comments are opt-in.** `comment` is student-visible in SpeedGrader, it
> **appends** on every call rather than replacing, and it cannot be un-sent.
> Ask for one only when you want written feedback — "assign grade 8" means the
> grade alone. A comment that only restates the grade or notes that grading
> happened is worse than none.

**Returns:** Summary of grading operation including total submissions, successfully graded, failed attempts, and any error details.

**Notes:**
- Supports both rubric-based grading and simple point-based grading
- `dry_run: true` previews the grade **and** any comment that would be posted
- Can mix and match grading styles for different students
- Automatically validates rubric configuration before grading
- Use `dry_run=true` to preview grades before applying
- For custom bulk grading logic that can return selected output, consider `execute_typescript` with `bulkGrade` from the code execution API

---

### Student Analytics

#### `get_student_analytics`
Multi-dimensional student performance analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `student_id` (optional): Specific student or all students

**Example:**
```
"Show me student performance in BADM 350"
"Analyze Student_abc123's progress"
```

**Returns:** Assignment completion, grade trends, participation, and risk indicators.

---

#### `check_enrollment`
Check whether a specific campus login ID is enrolled in a course. Answers a roster-membership question about an externally-supplied person (not the caller) and returns **only** a yes/no plus minimal enrollment metadata — never the roster, names, or grades. Requires a Canvas token with roster-admin rights.

> **A token without roster rights does not fail loudly.** Canvas returns HTTP 200 with the full roster and silently omits `login_id`/`sis_user_id` from every user, so the identifier can never match. This tool detects that and answers **INDETERMINATE**, never "no" — permission-blindness is not absence. To ask about *yourself*, use [`get_my_enrollments`](#get_my_enrollments) instead, which needs no roster permission.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code, numeric ID, or SIS ID
- `net_id`: The person's campus login ID — a NetID (UIUC), uniqname (UMich), campus ID, or the full email-style Canvas login. Matched case-insensitively against `login_id`, then `sis_user_id`. **Not** a display name.
- `role` (optional): Enrollment type that satisfies the check — `student` (default), `teacher`, `ta`, `observer`, `designer`, or `any`
- `active_only` (optional): Only count active enrollments (default `true`)

**Example:**
```
"Is netid jdoe2 enrolled in BADM 350?"
```

**Returns:** A yes/no answer with the enrollment state, role, and which field matched. Data-minimizing by design — built for external access gating (e.g. UniQuick) without exposing the class roster.

> **Identifier form is flexible, but never guessed at.** Canvas does not define what `login_id` holds — UIUC stores the bare NetID (`jdoe2`), other instances store the full email (`jdoe2@umich.edu`). An exact match always wins. Failing that, a **bare** identifier may match a domain-qualified roster value (`zqian` finds `zqian@umich.edu`), because there the roster's own domain is authoritative. The reverse is not inferred: since this tool is used as an access gate, anything unverifiable returns **AMBIGUOUS** rather than a yes or a no —
>
> - two differing full addresses (`jdoe@school.edu` vs `jdoe@other.edu`) are different people, and a bare `sis_user_id` on that same user will not override their own domain;
> - an identifier matching several people by local part alone is not resolved by roster order;
> - a qualified identifier offered to a roster of bare IDs is unverifiable — `jdoe@attacker.example` has as much claim on a stored `jdoe` as the real domain does. Re-run with the bare ID.

> **`role` defaults to `student`, and a NO is scoped to that role.** Asking about a teacher with the default answers `NO — … has no active 'student' enrollment`, which is true but reads as "not in this course". The answer now names any other role the person holds (`They ARE enrolled in this course, as: TeacherEnrollment`). Pass `role="any"` when you only want to know whether they are in the course at all.

#### `send_peer_review_followup_campaign`
Complete workflow: analyze peer review completion and send targeted reminders.

**Two-step by design.** Call it without a `confirmation_token` to get the
analytics plus the fully rendered subject/body of each reminder batch (urgent
vs gentle) and a single-use token; call again with the token to send. The
token commits to the recipients AND the rendered text, so it is void if the
completion analytics shifted or the assignment was renamed in between.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID

- `confirmation_token` (optional): Token from the preview call; omit to preview

**Example:**
```
"Analyze peer review completion and remind everyone who's behind"

### Communication & Messaging

#### `send_conversation`
Send messages to students.

**Sending to exactly one plain numeric user ID is a single call. Anything else
is two-step** — multiple recipients, or any expandable alias like `course_123`
or `group_45` (which fans out server-side): call without a `confirmation_token`
to get a preview (recipients, subject, body, attachments, delivery flags) plus
a single-use token, then call again with the token and identical arguments to
send.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `recipients`: User IDs (array)
- `subject`: Message subject
- `body`: Message content
- `confirmation_token` (optional): Token from the preview call (multi-recipient only)

**Example:**
```
"Message students who haven't submitted Assignment 3"
```

---

#### `send_peer_review_inbox_messages`
Send direct Canvas Inbox messages about incomplete peer reviews. This tool sends
ordinary conversation messages; it does **not** invoke Canvas's native
peer-review reminder action. It verifies the course-level `manage_grades`
permission before preparing or sending a message.

**Two-step by design.** Call it without a `confirmation_token` to get a preview
(recipients, composed subject and body) plus a single-use token; call again
with the token and identical arguments to send. The token is void if the
composed message changed (e.g. the assignment was renamed).

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `assignment_id`: Assignment ID
- `recipient_ids`: Students to message (array)
- `custom_message` (optional): Custom message template
- `confirmation_token` (optional): Token from the preview call; omit to preview

**Example:**
```
"Send reminders to students who haven't completed peer reviews"
```

---

#### `send_bulk_messages_from_list`
Send customized messages to multiple recipients using templates with per-recipient variables.

**Two-step by design.** Call it without a `confirmation_token` to get a preview
that renders **every** outbound message plus a single-use token; show the
preview to the educator, then call again with the token and identical arguments
to actually send. Rows with invalid or alias user IDs, or that fail to render,
fail the preview before a token is issued. The token expires after a few
minutes and is void if any argument changed since the preview. This prevents
content read from Canvas (e.g. a student-authored message) from silently
triggering a bulk send.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `recipient_data`: List of dicts with recipient info and template variables
- `subject_template`: Subject with placeholders (e.g., `"Reminder - {missing_count} reviews"`)
- `body_template`: Body with placeholders (e.g., `"Hi {name}, you have {missing_count}..."`)
- `context_code` (optional): Course context
- `mode` (optional): `sync` (default) or `async`
- `confirmation_token` (optional): Token from the preview call; omit to preview

**Example:**
```
"Send this templated reminder to these 12 students"
```

**Returns:** Without a token: a preview with `confirmation_token` (nothing sent).
With a valid token: per-recipient success/failure summary of sent messages.

---

#### `create_announcement`
Post course announcements. Before posting, the tool checks the course's
announcement permission and refuses on an explicit denial. Canvas can
occasionally accept the request but create a regular discussion instead; the
tool verifies the returned type, deletes that unintended topic automatically,
and reports failure. If cleanup cannot be confirmed, the response includes the
topic ID when Canvas returned one and tells the user to check the course and
remove the unintended topic. It never falls back to a discussion post.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `title`: Announcement title
- `message`: Announcement content

**Example:**
```
"Create an announcement about tomorrow's exam"
```

---

### Discussion Management

**Returns:** Course files with IDs, names, sizes, and folders.

---

#### `download_course_file`
Download a course file to the local filesystem of the machine running the MCP server.

> **Local (stdio) servers only.** The write lands on the *server's* filesystem,
> which a remote caller cannot read anyway, so the tool refuses over HTTP and
> points at `read_course_file` instead. It also never overwrites: the
> destination is created exclusively, so a Canvas file named e.g. `.zshrc`
> cannot clobber a real file in the chosen directory.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `file_id`: Canvas file ID (find it with `list_course_files` or `list_module_items`)
- `save_directory` (optional): Local directory to save to (default: system temp dir, must exist)

**Returns:** Local path of the downloaded file with size and content type. Errors
if the destination already exists rather than overwriting it.

---

#### `read_course_file`
Read a course file and return its content directly in the response as base64. Unlike `download_course_file`, nothing is written to the server's filesystem, so this works when the MCP server runs on a different machine than the client.

**Parameters:**
- `course_identifier`: Course code or ID
- `file_id`: Canvas file ID (find it with `list_course_files` or `list_module_items`)
- `max_size_mb` (optional): Maximum file size in MB to read (default: 25). Clamped server-side to `READ_FILE_MAX_SIZE_MB` (default 100); larger files are rejected to avoid excessive memory usage.

**Example:**
```
"Read the rubric spreadsheet from course files"
```

**Returns:** File content as base64 with name, size, and content type.

---

## Developer Tools

These tools help developers discover, explore, and execute Canvas code execution API operations.

### Tool Discovery

#### `search_canvas_tools`
Search and discover available Canvas tools by keyword — both the registered
MCP tools (the ~99 Python tools like `list_peer_reviews`,
`create_assignment`, called directly) and the TypeScript code execution API
operations (used from `execute_typescript`). Matches against tool name and
description.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (optional): Search term to filter tools. Empty string returns all tools. Examples: "peer review", "grading", "assignment", "discussion", "bulk"
- `detail_level` (optional): How much information to return. Default: "signatures"
  - `"names"`: Just tool names / file paths (most efficient for quick lookups)
  - `"signatures"`: Names/paths + short descriptions + function signatures (recommended)
  - `"full"`: Fuller descriptions for MCP tools (capped length) and code API file content capped at 2,000 characters per match

**Example:**
```
"Search for peer review tools"
"Search for grading tools in the code API"
"What bulk operations are available?"
"Show me all code API tools"
"Find discussion-related operations"
```

**Returns:** Response schema version `2`. A successful search returns JSON with
`schema_version`, `query`, `detail_level`, `count`, and two labeled sections —
`mcp_tools` (registered MCP tools) and `code_execution_api` (TypeScript code API
modules) — each with its own `count` and `tools` array. The pre-v1.10 flat
top-level `tools` key no longer exists; scripted clients should branch on
`schema_version`. A no-match response still includes `schema_version: 2` and
reports the message plus `mcp_tools_searched` instead of empty result sections.

**Usage Tips:**
- Use empty query (`""`) to list all available tools
- Use `"signatures"` detail level for most tasks (default)
- Use `"names"` when you just need a quick overview
- Use `"full"` only when you need to see complete implementation details

**Example Direct Usage:**
```typescript
// Search for peer-review tools across both MCP tools and the code API
search_canvas_tools("peer review", "signatures")

// Search for grading-related tools with signatures
search_canvas_tools("grading", "signatures")

// List all available tools (names only)
search_canvas_tools("", "names")

// Get full implementation details for bulk operations
search_canvas_tools("bulk", "full")
```

---

#### `list_code_api_modules`
List all available TypeScript modules in the code execution API.

**Parameters:** None

**Example:**
```
"What TypeScript modules are available?"
"List all code API modules"
"Show me the available code execution operations"
```

**Returns:** Formatted list of all TypeScript files organized by category (grading, assignments, courses, discussions, etc.) with import paths.

**Usage Tips:**
- Use this for a quick overview of all available operations
- Results show the exact import paths to use in `execute_typescript`
- Organized by category for easy navigation

---

### Code Execution

#### `execute_typescript`
Execute TypeScript code in a Node.js environment with access to Canvas API credentials.

This tool can reduce model-context use by processing bulk items locally and returning only selected output. Actual savings depend on the workload and AI client.

**Parameters:**
- `code`: TypeScript code to execute. Can import from './canvas/*' modules.
- `timeout` (optional): Maximum execution time in seconds (default: 120)

**Example:**
```
"Grade all 90 Jupyter notebook submissions using bulk grading"
"Send reminders to all students who haven't submitted"
"Analyze discussion participation across all students"
```

**Example Code:**
```typescript
import { bulkGrade } from './canvas/grading/bulkGrade.js';

await bulkGrade({
  courseIdentifier: "60366",
  assignmentId: "123",
  gradingFunction: (submission) => {
    // This runs locally - no token cost!
    const notebook = submission.attachments?.find(
      f => f.filename.endsWith('.ipynb')
    );

    if (!notebook) return null;

    return {
      points: 100,
      rubricAssessment: { "_8027": { points: 100 } },
      comment: "Great work!"
    };
  }
});
```

**Returns:** Combined stdout and stderr from execution, or error message if failed.

**Platform Support:**
- **macOS/Linux**: Uses `npx tsx` directly
- **Windows**: Automatically locates the tsx CLI entry point via `shutil.which` or `%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\tsx\dist\cli.mjs`, then invokes it via `node` to avoid `.cmd` batch wrapper limitations

**Security:**
- Code runs in a temporary file that is deleted after execution
- Inherits Canvas API credentials from server environment
- Timeout enforced to prevent runaway processes
- Local sandbox controls are best-effort, not a complete security boundary; code can access resources allowed to the server process, and strict egress control requires external isolation (see [issue #157](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/issues/157))

**Token Efficiency:**
- **Traditional approach**: Tool-by-tool processing may return each submission to the model
- **Code execution approach**: Per-item work runs locally and only selected output returns

**Usage Tips:**
- First use `search_canvas_tools` or `list_code_api_modules` to discover available operations
- Import operations from './canvas/*' paths (e.g., './canvas/grading/bulkGrade.js')
- Processing happens locally - only results flow back to Claude's context
- Best for bulk operations, large datasets, and complex analysis
- Traditional tools still best for simple queries and small datasets

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### For Students

1. **Be specific**: Use course codes when possible (e.g., "BADM 350" instead of "my business class")
2. **Combine queries**: "Show me my grades and what's due this week"
3. **Check regularly**: Use for daily planning and weekly organization
4. **No setup needed**: Student tools access only your data - no special configuration required

### For Educators

1. **Enable anonymization**: Set `ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true` in `.env` for FERPA-conscious data handling; this control does not by itself establish compliance
2. **Use course codes**: Be specific about which course (e.g., "badm_350_120251_246794")
3. **Leverage automation**: Use messaging and reminder tools for routine communications
4. **Combine analytics**: Request multiple analytics in one query for comprehensive insights
5. **Protect mapping files**: Keep `local_maps/` folder secure - never commit to version control

### General Best Practices

- **Ask follow-up questions**: Claude remembers context within a conversation
- **Request summaries**: "Summarize..." for quick overviews
- **Be conversational**: Natural language works better than rigid commands
- **Check tool output**: Review the data Claude retrieves before taking action

## Known API Limitations

Some Canvas API endpoints have bugs or design issues that prevent certain operations from working correctly.

### Rubric API Issues

| Tool | Status | Issue | Reference |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| `update_rubric` | Removed | API does full replacement instead of PATCH (causes data loss) | Internal testing |

**Workaround for Rubric Editing:**
1. **Edit rubrics** in Canvas web UI: Assignments → Edit → Rubric
2. **Copy rubrics** between courses: Use "Find a Rubric" in the rubric editor

**Working Rubric Tools:**
- `create_rubric` - Create a new rubric with defined criteria and ratings
- `create_rubric_from_csv` - Create a rubric using a CSV file upload
- `list_rubrics` - List rubrics in a course
- `get_rubric` - View rubric criteria and points (by rubric_id or assignment_id)
- `get_rubric_assessment` - View a student's rubric assessment
- `associate_rubric` - Link rubric to assignment
- `grade_with_rubric` - Grade single submission
- `bulk_grade_submissions` - Efficient batch grading
