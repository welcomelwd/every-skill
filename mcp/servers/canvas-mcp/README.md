## For AI Agents

<!--
  INLINE AGENT GUIDE: Intentionally duplicates AGENTS.md content.
  WHY: Agents often can't fetch raw.githubusercontent.com or GitHub blob pages.
  MAINTENANCE: When updating tools, also update AGENTS.md (source of truth).
  See CLAUDE.md "Documentation Maintenance" for full guidelines.

## Overview

The Canvas MCP Server bridges the gap between AI assistants and Canvas Learning Management System, providing role-specific workflows for students, educators, learning designers, and developers. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it is designed for MCP-compatible clients; setup and supported capabilities vary by client.

## Latest Release: v1.10.0

**Released:** August 2026 | **[Full Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)** | **[All Releases](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/releases)**

A community bug-fix release driven by live reporter testing — thanks [@khagyard](https://github.com/khagyard), [@zqian](https://github.com/zqian), [@jonespm](https://github.com/jonespm), [@bruchris](https://github.com/bruchris), and [@SHIL0018](https://github.com/SHIL0018) (our second outside code contribution). One change is **breaking** — see below before upgrading.

- **Breaking: `search_canvas_tools` response shape v2** ([#281](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/issues/281)). The tool now actually searches the ~99 registered MCP tools alongside the TypeScript code-API files (it previously searched only the latter, so "peer review" found nothing despite ~10 peer-review tools existing). Responses carry `schema_version: 2` with labeled `mcp_tools` / `code_execution_api` sections; the old flat `tools` key is gone. Full-detail code-API content is now also capped at 2,000 characters ([#287](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/issues/287))
- **Students can find their peer reviews** ([#275](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/issues/275)): `get_my_peer_reviews_todo` gained a direct per-assignment lookup and a Planner-feed discovery path — the same data source Canvas's own student UI uses — validated against a real production payload from the reporter
- **`create_announcement` fails safely on student tokens** ([#283](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/issues/283)): Canvas silently downgrades the create to a regular discussion topic; the tool now pre-checks course permissions and refuses before creating anything, auto-deletes the unintended topic if a downgrade still slips through, and steers AI clients away from posting the content via discussion tools as a fallback
- **Security:** stricter URL validation (code-scanning fix), Docker base bumped to `python:3.14-slim`, CI actions updated

<details>

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

### For Educators: FERPA-Conscious Data Handling

Canvas MCP provides optional privacy controls that can support an institution's FERPA obligations. Compliance still depends on your deployment, configuration, institutional policy, and AI provider:

- **Response anonymization** converts supported identity fields to consistent anonymous IDs (Student_xxxxxxxx)
- **Email masking and supported PII-pattern filtering** in discussion posts and submissions
- **Local server deployment** with configurable privacy controls (`ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`)
- **Privacy-conscious analytics**: Ask "Which students need support?" while reducing the identity data returned to the AI client
- **De-anonymization mapping tool** for faculty to correlate anonymous IDs with real students locally

When `ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true` is enabled, supported identity fields are anonymized before tool results reach the AI client. Review the [Educator Guide](https://canvas-mcp.illinihunt.org/educator-guide.html) and your institution's requirements before using student data.

### For Students: Data Scope & Privacy

- **Canvas-scoped access**: Student-specific tools use Canvas's "self" endpoints; shared course-content tools follow the permissions Canvas grants your account
- **No shared-server credential storage**: Local mode reads your Canvas token from your own `.env`. In authenticated institutional HTTP deployments, each request supplies the user's Canvas token and the server does not store it.
- **No built-in product analytics**: Canvas MCP does not add telemetry; Canvas and your AI client still apply their own logging and data policies
- **Optional anonymization**: Student tools are scoped to your own Canvas data, but your AI client's privacy policy still applies

## Hosted Server (Retired)

The public hosted server (`mcp.illinihunt.org`) has been **retired**. A public MCP endpoint without an access gate isn't safe to operate — it would expose the built-in code-execution tool — so the supported path is **[local installation](#local-installation)** below.

The HTTP/streamable transport itself remains fully supported for **self-hosting behind your own authentication** (`canvas-mcp-server --transport streamable-http`). Running a shared, authenticated instance for your institution? See **[deploy/azure/](deploy/azure/)** for a production-tested deployment specification (Azure App Service + Entra ID platform auth, per-user Canvas tokens) with sample workflow and config templates.

---

## Prerequisites (Local Installation)

- **Python 3.10+** - Required for modern features and type hints
- **Canvas API Access** - API token and institution URL
- **MCP Client** - An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Zed, Windsurf, Continue, etc.); setup and capabilities vary by client

### Supported MCP Clients

Canvas MCP is designed for MCP-compatible clients, including [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Zed](https://zed.dev), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), [Continue](https://continue.dev), [Replit](https://replit.com), and [Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio). Setup details and supported capabilities vary by client.

Canvas MCP uses documented Canvas API patterns such as a User-Agent header and `per_page` pagination. It is intended for Canvas Cloud and compatible self-hosted instances.

## Install as a Claude Desktop Extension (easiest)

If you use **Claude Desktop**, you can install Canvas MCP with one click — no terminal, no config-file editing:

1. Download `canvas-mcp.mcpb` from the [latest release](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/releases/latest).
2. Double-click the file (or drag it into Claude Desktop → Settings → Extensions).
3. When prompted, enter your **Canvas API URL** — this must include the `/api/v1` path (e.g. `https://canvas.youruniversity.edu/api/v1`) — and your **Canvas API token** (Canvas → Account → Settings → New Access Token). The token is stored in your OS keychain.

The extension runs the server locally and calls Canvas with **your own** token, so requests use that token's Canvas permissions. Canvas and your AI client may retain their own activity records. Requires Python 3.10+ (the bundled runtime manages dependencies automatically). For other clients, or to run from source, use the manual setup below.

## Local Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# (Recommended) Use a dedicated virtualenv so the MCP binary is in a stable location
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package editable
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.template .env

# Edit with your Canvas credentials
# Required: CANVAS_API_TOKEN, CANVAS_API_URL
```

Get your Canvas API token from: **Canvas → Account → Settings → New Access Token**

> **Note for Students**: Some educational institutions restrict API token creation for students. If you see an error like "There is a limit to the number of access tokens you can create" or cannot find the token creation option, contact your institution's Canvas administrator or IT support department to request API access or assistance in creating a token.

### 3. MCP Client Configuration

Canvas MCP is designed for MCP-compatible clients. Below are configuration examples for popular clients; exact setup and capabilities vary by client:

<details open>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong> (Most Popular)</summary>

**Configuration file location:**

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canvas-api": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/canvas-mcp/.venv/bin/canvas-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Use the absolute path to your virtualenv binary to avoid issues with shell-specific PATH entries (e.g., pyenv shims).

</details>

<details>

    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Other MCP Clients</strong></summary>

For other MCP-compatible clients, the general pattern is:

1. Locate your client's MCP configuration file
2. Add a server entry with:
   - **Server name**: `canvas-api` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Command**: Full path to `canvas-mcp-server` binary
   - **Optional args**: Additional arguments if needed

Consult your client's MCP documentation for specific configuration format and file locations.

</details>

> **Windows users**: Replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\canvas-mcp\.venv\Scripts\canvas-mcp-server.exe`)

## Verification

Test your setup:

```bash
# Test Canvas API connection
canvas-mcp-server --test

# View configuration
canvas-mcp-server --config

# Start server (for manual testing)
canvas-mcp-server
```

## Available Tools

The Canvas MCP Server provides a set of tools for interacting with the Canvas LMS API. These tools are organized into logical categories for better discoverability and maintainability.

### Tool Categories

**Student Tools** (New!)
- Personal assignment tracking and deadline management
- Grade monitoring across all courses
- TODO list and peer review management
- Submission status tracking

**Shared Tools** (Both Students & Educators)
1. **Course Tools** - List and manage courses, get detailed information, generate summaries with syllabus content
2. **Discussion & Announcement Tools** - Manage discussions, announcements, and replies
3. **Page & Content Tools** - Access pages, modules, and course content

**Educator Tools**
4. **Assignment Tools** - Handle assignments, submissions, and peer reviews with analytics
5. **Rubric Tools** - List rubrics, associate with assignments, and grade submissions (including `bulk_grade_submissions` for efficient batch grading). Note: Create/update rubrics via Canvas web UI due to API limitations.
6. **User & Enrollment Tools** - Manage enrollments, users, and groups
7. **Analytics Tools** - View student analytics, assignment statistics, and progress tracking
8. **Messaging Tools** - Send messages and announcements to students

**Developer Tools**
9. **Discovery Tools** - Search registered MCP tools and code execution API operations with `search_canvas_tools`; list code execution modules with `list_code_api_modules`
10. **Code Execution Tools** - Execute TypeScript code with `execute_typescript` so bulk item processing can stay out of the model's context

📖 [View Full Tool Documentation](tools/README.md) for detailed information about the available tools.

## Code Execution API

For bulk operations (30+ items), Canvas MCP supports **TypeScript code execution**. Process bulk operations locally without loading every item into the model’s context.

| Approach | Best For | Context Behavior |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| MCP tools | Simple queries, small datasets | Returns tool results to the model |
| `bulk_grade_submissions` | Batch grading 10-29 items | Handles a defined batch in one tool call |
| `execute_typescript` | 30+ items, custom logic | Processes items locally and returns selected output |

Use `search_canvas_tools` to discover available operations, then `execute_typescript` to run them locally. The default sandbox applies time, memory, environment, and best-effort network controls, but it is not a complete security boundary; use stronger external isolation when untrusted code or strict egress control is required (see [issue #157](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/issues/157)). Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

<details>
<summary>Code execution examples and security details</summary>

### Bulk Grading Example

```typescript
import { bulkGrade } from './canvas/grading/bulkGrade';

await bulkGrade({
  courseIdentifier: "60366",
  assignmentId: "123",
  gradingFunction: (submission) => {
    const notebook = submission.attachments?.find(f =>
      f.filename.endsWith('.ipynb')
    );
    if (!notebook) return null;
    return { points: 100, comment: "Great work!" };
  }
});
```

### Security Modes

| Mode | Config | What It Does |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Local sandbox (default) | None needed | Timeout 120s, memory 512MB, filtered environment, best-effort network controls |
| Container sandbox | `TS_SANDBOX_MODE=container` | Container filesystem isolation via Docker/Podman; egress guarantees depend on deployment configuration |
| No sandbox | `ENABLE_TS_SANDBOX=false` | Full local access (not recommended) |

See [Bulk Grading Example](examples/bulk_grading_example.md) for a detailed walkthrough.

</details>

## Usage

MCP clients start the server automatically. Just ask naturally:

<details>
<summary>Technical details</summary>

Built on **FastMCP** with async `httpx`, `pydantic` validation, and `python-dotenv` configuration. Modern `src/` layout with `pyproject.toml`, type hints across core paths, connection pooling, pagination, and rate limiting. An automated test suite and `ruff` + `black` support code quality.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Server Won't Start** - Verify your [Local Installation](#local-installation) setup: `.env` file, virtual environment path, and dependencies
2. **Authentication Errors** - Check your Canvas API token validity and permissions
3. **Connection Issues** - Verify Canvas API URL correctness and network access
4. **Debugging** - Check your MCP client's console logs (e.g., Claude Desktop's developer console) or run server manually for error output

## Security

Runtime security and privacy controls:

| Layer | Default |
|-------|---------|
| PII sanitization in logs | `LOG_REDACT_PII=true` |
| Token validation on startup | Always on |
| Structured audit logging | Opt-in: `LOG_ACCESS_EVENTS=true` |
| Code execution guardrails | `ENABLE_TS_SANDBOX=true` (best-effort in local mode) |

Optional anonymization for FERPA-conscious educator workflows: `ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`. See [Educator Guide](https://canvas-mcp.illinihunt.org/educator-guide.html) for scope and configuration details.

## Publishing

Published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/canvas-mcp/), [MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/), and [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) (agent skills). Releases are automated via GitHub Actions — tag a version (`git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`) and CI handles the rest.
