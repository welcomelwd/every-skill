"""Shared wording for writes Canvas accepted but did not visibly perform,
plus the two-step confirmation-token guard for destructive tools.

Canvas frequently answers 200 while doing less than asked: rubric
associations it silently ignored (#180/#181/#190), announcements downgraded
to plain discussions for tokens without permission (#220), and module-item
"done" PUTs that no-op when the item has no must_mark_done requirement
(#221). The house rule is: never report success for a state the user cannot
see in Canvas. Centralising the wording keeps that failure legible and
identical across tools instead of drifting per call site.

``ConfirmationGuard`` generalises the preview→token→confirm pattern that
``tools/student_write.py`` established for assignment submission, so
educator-side destructive tools can require the same explicit two-step. The
threat it addresses (issue 239) is a prompt-injected model chaining a read of
student-authored content straight into a write: a required, single-use,
content-bound token forces a human-visible preview between "decided to send"
and "sent".
