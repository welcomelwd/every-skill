"""Per-course instructor policy for student write tools (#170).

Faculty need agency over whether AI agents may write in *their* course, separate
from whatever the campus operator has enabled server-wide. Canvas has no native
concept of "agent access", so the policy is expressed as a Canvas-native
artifact that the instructor controls.

Choosing the carrier is the whole security question here, because the policy is
read using the *student's own token*. The artifact must be one the student
cannot author or alter, and there is exactly one such option:

**The syllabus.** ``syllabus_body`` is editable only by instructors and admins
under every standard Canvas role, and readable by enrolled students. That makes
instructor authorship structural rather than assumed.

A course Page was considered and deliberately **rejected**, which is worth
recording so it is not reintroduced. Pages carry an ``editing_roles`` setting,
and the obvious guard is to trust only teacher-only pages. That guard does not
work: ``editing_roles`` describes who may edit a page *now*, not who wrote it.
In a course where students may create pages, a student can create the policy
page containing ``agent_writes: allow`` and set it teacher-only in the same
breath, locking themselves out *after* authoring the content that governs them.
Authorship cannot be established from a student's own token, so a Page can
never be a trustworthy authorization source here, however it is screened.

Layering holds strictly: ``STUDENT_WRITE_TOOLS`` is the campus-wide operator
ceiling. A course policy may only further restrict within it, never expand it,
because a course-level artifact is the wrong trust level for widening a
campus-wide permission.

Failure posture: only a definitively read, well-formed artifact can yield
"allow". Malformed content, permission failures, transient errors and
untrusted-provenance artifacts all deny.
