    Sensitive-data checks MUST run before any safe-endpoint reasoning: almost
    every call here is scoped /courses/{id}/..., so a '/courses' short-circuit
    checked first silently disables anonymization for the whole codebase
    (issue #164). Anything not matched defaults to ANONYMIZE_NONE.

    The tiers are ordered most-protective-first, so a path that matches several
    families (e.g. /courses/1/pages plus a /users segment) gets the strongest
    treatment rather than the narrowest.

    Partially gated (issue #179) — matched, but NOT at the "full" tier:
    - /conversations, /conversations/{id} -> ANONYMIZE_FREE_TEXT. Previously
      ungated entirely: a live call returned 97 records with student email
      addresses inlined in `last_message`/`last_authored_message` plus
      participant pronouns and avatars. But this is the caller's OWN inbox, so
      the participants are their own correspondents, not third parties whose
      records they are browsing — pseudonymising `participants[].name` would
      make "who emailed me?" unanswerable while protecting nobody.
    - /pages, /courses/{id}/pages/{slug}, /courses/{id}/front_page ->
      ANONYMIZE_IDENTITY. Previously ungated: `last_edited_by` leaked a display
      name and avatar URL. front_page returns the same block but carries no
      'pages' segment, so it stayed ungated after #179 until a live check found
      it still returning display_name, pronouns and avatar_image_url. Page
      *bodies* are deliberately exempt — instructors publish office hours,
      contact addresses and phone numbers on course pages, and redacting those
      would break the page's purpose.

    Intentionally NOT matched at all:
    - /groups listings — carry group names, not student names; generic
      anonymization would mangle them. Membership goes via /groups/{id}/users,
      which the '/users' rule covers.
    - /discussion_topics listings (incl. announcements) — typically
      instructor-authored; student content lives under the content endpoints
      matched below.
    - /submissions/self — the caller's OWN submission. Anonymizing it redacts
      body/url/attachments, so a student cannot read back what they submitted
      (issue #166). Only the literal 'self' sub-route is excluded; any other
      sensitive segment in the same path still forces anonymization.
    - the exact self-only paths in _SELF_ONLY_ENDPOINTS — the caller's OWN
      identity (issue #171). Exact full-path match only.
