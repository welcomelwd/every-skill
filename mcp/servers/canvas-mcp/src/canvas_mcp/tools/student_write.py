"""Tier 1 student write tools (#170).

These are the first tools that let an agent act *on* Canvas on a student's
behalf rather than only read. Four properties are load-bearing:

1. **No identity override on the wire.** The submit endpoint
   (``POST /courses/:id/assignments/:id/submissions``) is not structurally
   self-scoped: Canvas accepts ``submission[user_id]`` there when the token
   carries grading permission, and a real person can hold mixed student and TA
   enrollments. So rather than trusting the tool profile, every outbound write
   body is checked against an identity-override denylist immediately before it
   is sent (``assert_no_identity_override``).
2. **Operator ceiling.** A tool absent from ``STUDENT_WRITE_TOOLS`` is never
   registered, so it never enters the MCP tool list. The default is empty.
3. **Instructor agency.** Within that ceiling, a per-course policy can further
   restrict writes, and it is re-checked immediately before the write itself,
   not merely during the preview. See ``core/course_policy.py``.
4. **Confirmation bound to content.** ``submit_assignment`` will not submit on
   a bare boolean. The preview issues a short-lived, single-use token bound to
   the target, the payload hash and the observed attempt number, so an agent
   cannot submit without first surfacing a preview, and cannot submit something
   other than what was previewed.

Group assignments are refused in Tier 1: a submission to a group assignment
becomes the whole group's submission, affecting students who never consented,
and those shared-attempt semantics deserve their own decision.
