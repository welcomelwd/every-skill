"""Enrollment-check MCP tool for Canvas API.

Thin wrapper over ``core.enrollment.check_enrollment`` — answers "is this login
ID enrolled in course X?" with a minimal yes/no, never the roster. Requires a
Canvas token with roster-admin rights.

"NetID" is a UIUC term; the equivalent is a uniqname, NetID, campus ID, or the
email-style Canvas login, depending on the institution (issue #199). The
parameter matches whatever Canvas stores in ``login_id`` / ``sis_user_id``.

A token WITHOUT those rights does not fail loudly: Canvas returns HTTP 200 with
the full roster and silently omits ``login_id``/``sis_user_id`` from every user.
That case is reported as INDETERMINATE, never as "NO" — see
``core.enrollment.EnrollmentCheckUnavailable``.

        Answers a roster-membership question about an externally-supplied person
        (NOT the caller). Returns only a yes/no plus minimal enrollment metadata —
        never the roster, names, or grades. Requires a Canvas token with
        roster-admin rights; without them the answer is INDETERMINATE, never "no".

        To ask about YOURSELF, use get_my_enrollments instead — it needs no
        roster permission and cannot return an indeterminate answer.

        Note that `role` defaults to "student". A NO answer is scoped to that
        role and will name any other role the person holds; pass role="any" when
        you just want to know whether they are in the course at all.
