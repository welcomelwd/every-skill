"""Least-privilege policy for AI-driven GitHub workflows.

The weekly maintenance job feeds untrusted input — public issue text and web
search results, both writable by anyone — into a model that simultaneously
holds a GITHUB_TOKEN. Prompt injection in that input is not reliably
preventable, so the control is the token: it must not be able to do more than
the job's one legitimate output, filing a maintenance issue.

These are policy assertions, not behavior tests. They exist so a future edit
that re-broadens the token or the tool allowlist fails here rather than in
production.
