"""Tool-annotation contract (issues #200, #204).

Every registered tool must declare what it does to the world. A read tool says
``readOnlyHint=True``; a write tool must answer both remaining questions —
whether it replaces existing data (``destructiveHint``) and whether repeating it
changes anything (``idempotentHint``).

The point of the first test is that a NEW tool cannot land without making those
declarations: an unannotated tool fails CI rather than shipping bare, which is
how #200 happened in the first place. Enumerating the live registry rather than
a hand-maintained list is what makes that work.

Semantics follow the MCP spec, not a local convention: ``destructiveHint=False``
asserts the tool performs ONLY ADDITIVE updates, so a tool that overwrites grades
or replaces a page body is destructive even though it deletes nothing.
