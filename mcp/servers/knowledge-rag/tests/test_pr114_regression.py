"""Anti-regression tests for issue #114.

Pins the contract that ``_ensure_bm25_index`` only marks
``_bm25_initialized = True`` after a build that actually produced an index.
An empty-collection bootup or a build-time exception must leave the flag
``False`` so a later call retries once content is present.

Bug history (issue #114): prior behavior set the flag unconditionally at
the end of the guarded block. If the server booted against an empty
ChromaDB (fresh install, or metadata-mapping loss after a partial
reindex), the flag trapped in ``True`` with an empty inverted index.
Subsequent ``add_document`` calls populate ``bm25_index.corpus`` but do
not rebuild the inverted index — ``_ensure_bm25_index`` is the only path
that does, and it short-circuited on the stale flag. All keyword-only
searches returned zero results; hybrid searches returned only semantic
hits with ``bm25_rank: null``.
