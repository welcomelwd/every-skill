"""FTS5 lexical fast-path microbenchmarks (Fase 5, ADR-004 gate).

Tracked metrics for the v4.9.0 default-flip gate:
    bench_fts5_lexical_cold_p95           BENCH-001 target p95 <= 10ms
    bench_fts5_lexical_hot_p95            BENCH-002 target p95 <=  2ms

Regression sentinels (compared against the pre-Fase-5 baseline of
``bench/test_bench_search.py`` via ``scripts/check_perf_regression.py
--threshold 0.02``):
    BENCH-003 — hybrid path with feature ON (<= 2% regression, gate G2)
    BENCH-004 — hybrid path with feature OFF (zero-cost early-return)

BENCH-003 and BENCH-004 are executed by re-running the existing
``bench/test_bench_search.py`` suite with the FTS5 feature toggled via
env override (see ``bench_v4_9_0_gate.md`` for the CI procedure). They
are documented here — not duplicated — so the baseline metric IDs stay
stable between comparisons.

The ``corpus_3865_docs`` fixture from PRD ``_tests.md`` was not shipped
as a shared fixture in earlier fases; this file builds an equivalent
3865-row corpus in-process against a temporary SQLite FTS5 index. That
keeps the bench self-contained and lets CI cells run it without a
FastEmbed/ChromaDB download.
