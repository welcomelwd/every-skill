/**
 * @version 1.0.0
 * TimeContext.hook.ts — inject a LIVE, per-turn wall-clock line on UserPromptSubmit
 * so the assistant always knows the current time, date, and day of week.
 *
 * Ported from public PR #1511 (credit @anikinsasha). Why: the harness
 * `currentDate` context is date-only and anchored at session start, so on a
 * long-running session it goes stale — the model can believe it is still
 * "morning" hours after midnight, or reason from yesterday's date. This hook
 * recomputes the wall clock every turn and injects it as additionalContext, so
 * the value can never drift within a session.
 *
 * Timezone comes from settings.json `principal.timezone`; falls back to UTC if
 * unset or unreadable. Fails open: any error is swallowed and the turn proceeds
 * without the line — a timestamp is nice-to-have, never worth blocking.
