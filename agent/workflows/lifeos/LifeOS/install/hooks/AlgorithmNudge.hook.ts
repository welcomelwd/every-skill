/**
 * @version 3.1.0
 * TRIGGER: UserPromptSubmit (routing match, always-on) — also runs on PostToolUse via PostToolObserver and on PostToolUseFailure.
 * AlgorithmNudge — the Algorithm live nudge layer ("Events ask the rest").
 *
 * ROWS (what each one is for):
 *   depth-directive   — a plain-language depth directive in a NO-RUN turn signals the turn
 *                       IS a run; doctrine claims 10/15 only have teeth once one exists.
 *   design-class      — authority/security-boundary or architecture work points at
 *                       OPERATIONAL_RULES § Model selection: design the thing NATIVELY and
 *                       inline BEFORE building, on the top rung the main loop already runs
 *                       (settings.json pins it). Never ask which rung, never hand the design
 *                       leg to the Max agent — that is a second look, not a rung rental.
 *                       INC-20260729-max-rung-not-elected, both corrections.
 *   exec-delegation   — a sustained stretch of build calls (Edit/Write) with zero Agent
 *                       dispatches asks the down-rung question from OPERATIONAL_RULES
 *                       § Model selection: is this stretch judgment work that earns MAX,
 *                       or an execution leg that should ride a dispatch a rung down?
 *   inherited-dispatch — an Agent dispatch carrying no `model` field inherits the MAX
 *                       session rung; one line surfaces that fact so inheriting is a
 *                       decision, not the silent default. Evidence for both rows:
 *                       subagent-events.jsonl, 10K events, zero explicit models ever
 *                       (measured 2026-08-01) — prose alone did not produce a single
 *                       rung-down in the system's life.
 *   capability        — a Bash failure exercising a Doctor-tracked capability that
 *                       capabilities.json marks broken emits its compile-time CAP_FIX
 *                       command (60-min per-capability cooldown; the manifest is state
 *                       only, never a prose source).
 *
 * Every row is an ADVISORY QUESTION. A Stop-blocking variant was adversarially killed for
 * good reason: it Goodharts into token dispatches, because it gates on procedure instead of
 * outcome. Keep rows advisory.
 *
 * TWO SCOPES:
 *   ALWAYS-ON  (any session)          → skill-routing + depth-directive
 *                                       (UserPromptSubmit),
 *                                       late-ISA (PostToolUse, no registered run),
 *                                       capability row (PostToolUseFailure)
 *   RUN-SCOPED (live Algorithm run)   → stale-isa
 *
 * Fires the right one-line question at the moment it's answerable. Deterministic,
 * zero inference calls, always exits 0, hot path target <20ms.
 *
 * A row may only fire for state the model cannot observe from its own context — an
 * unwritten ISA, a stale one, a destructive op's blast radius, a capability the manifest
 * knows is broken. Asking the model to notice something already in front of it (probe-fail,
 * agent-return, claim-close, spend) is scaffolding and does not earn a row.
 *
 * Events (dispatched by hook_event_name):
 *   UserPromptSubmit          → routing match (always-on) + depth + design-class
 *   PostToolUse               → stale-ISA | late-ISA
 *                               (reaches here via PostToolObserver's import of run())
 *   PostToolUseFailure        → capability row
 *
 * State: MEMORY/STATE/isa-nudge/{session_id}.json
 *   { toolCallsSinceISAEdit, toolCallsTotal, lateISAFired, lastNudgeAt: {type: epochMs},
 *     primaryTranscript }
 *
 * Skill index: MEMORY/STATE/skill-usewhen-index.json — trigger phrases parsed from
 * every skills/*\/SKILL.md frontmatter USE WHEN clause. NEVER scanned synchronously
 * on the hot path: a stale/missing index triggers a DETACHED rebuild
 * (`bun AlgorithmNudge.hook.ts --rebuild-index`) and this turn proceeds without it.
