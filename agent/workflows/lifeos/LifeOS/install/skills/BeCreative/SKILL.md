## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/BeCreative/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the BeCreative skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **BeCreative** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

# BeCreative Skill

## What It Does

Generates genuinely divergent ideas and expands small corpora. For a single creative request, it produces 5 internally diverse candidates (each low-probability, p<0.10) and surfaces the strongest. For corpus work, it grows a seed set of 5-20 examples into a larger diverse dataset for evals, training, or test sets. Seven workflows spanning standard creativity, maximum creativity, idea generation, tree-of-thoughts, domain-specific work, technical creativity, and synthetic-data expansion.

## The Problem

Ask a model for "a creative idea" and you get the most probable idea — the safe, obvious, already-seen one. Diversity collapses toward the mode. That's the opposite of what brainstorming needs. Verbalized Sampling fixes this by forcing the model to generate a spread of low-probability candidates instead of one high-probability answer, which measurably widens the range of what comes out. Combined with extended thinking, you get options that are both varied and good rather than varied and weak.

## How It Works

Enhances creativity using deep thinking plus Verbalized Sampling, combining research-backed techniques (Zhang et al., 2024) reporting a 1.6-2.1x diversity increase with extended thinking for quality. The core move: generate 5 diverse options (p<0.10 each) internally, then output the single best response. Verbalized Sampling depends on extended thinking being enabled.

## Workflow Routing

Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.

**When executing a workflow, output this notification:**
```
Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **BeCreative** skill to ACTION...
```

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| StandardCreativity | "be creative", "think creatively", default creative tasks | `Workflows/StandardCreativity.md` |
| MaximumCreativity | "maximum creativity", "most creative", "radically different" | `Workflows/MaximumCreativity.md` |
| IdeaGeneration | "brainstorm", "ideas for", "solve this problem" | `Workflows/IdeaGeneration.md` |
| TreeOfThoughts | "complex problem", "multi-factor", "explore paths" | `Workflows/TreeOfThoughts.md` |
| DomainSpecific | "artistic", "business innovation", domain-specific | `Workflows/DomainSpecific.md` |
| TechnicalCreativityGemini3 | "technical creativity", "algorithm", "architecture" | `Workflows/TechnicalCreativityGemini3.md` |
| SyntheticDataExpansion | "expand corpus", "synthetic data", "generate diverse examples", "expand seed set", "create test set from these" | `Workflows/SyntheticDataExpansion.md` |

---

## Quick Reference

**Core technique:** Generate 5 diverse options (p<0.10 each) internally, output single best response.

**Default approach:** For most creative requests, apply StandardCreativity workflow.

**For artistic/narrative creativity:** Apply workflow directly (no delegation needed).

**For technical creativity:** Use TechnicalCreativityGemini3 workflow.

## Integration with Other Skills

**Works well with:**
- **A social-post skill** (X / LinkedIn post workflows) - Generate creative social media content
- **A blog-authoring skill** - Creative blog post ideas and narrative approaches
- **Art** - Diverse image prompt ideas and creative directions
- **Research** - Creative research angles and synthesis approaches

---

## Examples

**Example 1: Creative blog angle**
```
User: "think outside the box for this AI ethics post"
-> Applies StandardCreativity workflow
-> Generates 5 diverse angles internally (p<0.10 each)
-> Returns most innovative framing approach
```

**Example 2: Product naming brainstorm**
```
User: "be creative - need names for this security tool"
-> Applies MaximumCreativity workflow
-> Explores unusual metaphors, domains, wordplay
-> Presents best option with reasoning
```

**Example 3: Technical creativity**
```
User: "deep thinking this architecture problem"
-> Invokes TechnicalCreativityGemini3 workflow
-> Uses Gemini 3 Pro for mathematical/algorithmic creativity
-> Returns novel technical solution
```

---

**Research-backed creative enhancement: 1.6-2.1x diversity, 25.7% quality improvement.**

## Gotchas

- **This is for QUICK divergent brainstorming.** For deep multi-cycle evolutionary ideation, use Ideate instead.
- **Verbalized Sampling requires extended thinking to work.** Don't disable extended thinking when using this skill.
- **1.6-2.1x diversity claims come from specific benchmark conditions.** Real-world diversity improvement varies with prompt type.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"BeCreative","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
