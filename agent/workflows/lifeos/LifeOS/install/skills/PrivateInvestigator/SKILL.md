# PrivateInvestigator - Ethical People Finding

## What It Does

Finds people and verifies identities using public data only. It covers people-search aggregators, social media, public records, and reverse lookups in parallel, then scores results by confidence (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/POSSIBLE) and trusts a match only when 3+ independent identifiers align.

## The Problem

Finding a real person from a name, a phone number, or an email is scattered across dozens of sources — people-search sites, county records, court portals, social platforms, reverse-lookup services — and no single one gives you the answer. Common names make it worse: search "John Smith" and you get thousands of people, most of them the wrong one. Run the searches one at a time and you either give up before you've covered enough sources or you act on a single weak match and contact the wrong person. This skill runs the sources in parallel and refuses to call a match real until several independent identifiers line up.

## How It Works

**Public data only.** No hacking, pretexting, or authentication bypass — every technique here is legal and ethical. The work runs as a parallel investigation across the source categories below; findings get cross-checked and confidence-scored before anything is reported. Choose the fan-out breadth the case needs — a common name across many states wants wide parallel coverage, a rare name in one city wants far less.

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| FindPerson | "find person", "locate", "search for [person]", "reconnect", "lost contact" — full parallel-agent investigation | `Workflows/FindPerson.md` |
| SocialMediaSearch | "social media search" — cross-platform social media investigation | `Workflows/SocialMediaSearch.md` |
| PublicRecordsSearch | "public records" — government and official records search | `Workflows/PublicRecordsSearch.md` |
| ReverseLookup | "reverse lookup" — phone, email, image, username searches | `Workflows/ReverseLookup.md` |
| VerifyIdentity | "verify identity" — confirm correct person match | `Workflows/VerifyIdentity.md` |

**When executing a workflow, output this notification:**

## When to Activate

### Direct People-Finding
- "find [person]", "locate [person]", "search for [person]"
- "reconnect with [person]", "looking for lost contact"
- "find an old friend", "locate a former coworker"

### Reverse Lookup
- "reverse phone lookup", "who owns this email"
- "reverse image search", "find person by username"

### Investigation
- "background check" (public data only)
- "what can you find about [person]"
- "research [person]"

## Research Strategy

**Done = broad, independent coverage.** Every source category below is worked, and no key identifier (address, employer, DOB, family, social handle) rests on a single source. Run the categories in parallel — dispatch research agents concurrently in one message — and scale the fan-out to the case: a common name across many states justifies many parallel agents and spelling/location variants; a rare name in one city needs only a few. Independence is the point, not headcount: aggregators that resell the same database count as one source, so weight toward genuinely distinct origins (social the subject created, government records, unrelated aggregators).

## Core Capabilities

### 1. People Search Aggregators
| Service | Type | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| TruePeopleSearch | Free | Best free option, fresh data |
| FastPeopleSearch | Free | Basic lookups, no signup |
| Spokeo | Freemium | Social media aggregation (120+ networks) |
| BeenVerified | Paid | Comprehensive background data |

### 2. Social Media Investigation
- **Facebook:** Google x-ray searches, mutual friends, groups
- **LinkedIn:** Boolean search, alumni networks
- **Instagram/Twitter/TikTok:** Username patterns, cross-platform correlation

### 3. Public Records
- **Voter Registration:** Most states publicly available
- **Property Records:** County assessor/recorder sites
- **Court Records:** PACER (federal), state court portals, CourtListener
- **Business Filings:** Secretary of State websites
- **Professional Licenses:** State licensing boards

### 4. Reverse Lookup
- **Phone:** CallerID, NumLookup, carrier lookup
- **Email:** Epieos, Holehe, Hunter.io
- **Image:** PimEyes, TinEye, Google/Yandex Images
- **Username:** Sherlock, WhatsMyName, Namechk

### 5. Google Dorking
```
site:linkedin.com "John Smith" "Software Engineer"
site:facebook.com "lives in" "Austin" "marketing"
filetype:pdf resume "Jane Doe" "San Francisco"
```

## Investigation Methodology

Anchor on whatever foundation identifiers the request gives — full name (and variations/maiden names), approximate age or DOB, last known location, context (school, workplace, relationship) — then pull from every source category until identifiers corroborate. Each discovered fact (phone, email, username, address, relative) is itself a new lead to run back through the sources, and every candidate gets a timeline-consistency and cross-source check before it earns a confidence score. The order is yours; the finish line is a match that survives the 3+-independent-identifier bar below.

## Confidence Scoring

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **HIGH** | 3+ unique identifiers match across independent sources | Safe to contact |
| **MEDIUM** | 2 identifiers match, timeline consistent | Verify before contact |
| **LOW** | Single source or name-only match | Needs more investigation |
| **POSSIBLE** | Partial match, requires verification | Do not act without more data |

## Dealing with Common Names

1. **Add Specificity** - Include location, age, employer, school
2. **Cross-Reference** - Match DOB + address patterns across sources
3. **Family Connections** - Verify through known relatives
4. **Timeline Analysis** - Does the life history make sense?
5. **Multiple Identifiers** - Require 3+ matching data points

## Legal & Ethical Boundaries

### GREEN ZONE (Allowed)
✅ Search public records (property, court, voter, business)
✅ Access publicly posted social media content
✅ Use people search aggregator sites
✅ Perform reverse lookups on public data
✅ Google dorking with public search operators

### RED ZONE (Never Cross)
❌ Access data behind login walls without authorization
❌ Bypass authentication or security measures
❌ Use pretexting or impersonation
❌ Access private databases (credit, financial, medical)
❌ Stalk, harass, or intimidate subjects
❌ Access PI-only databases without license

## When to STOP

- If the purpose shifts to harassment or stalking
- If the subject has clearly opted out of contact
- If investigation requires illegal methods
- If you suspect the requestor has malicious intent

## Examples

**Example 1: Finding an Old College Friend**
```
User: "Help me find my college roommate from 2005, John Smith from Austin"
→ Routes to FindPerson.md
→ Fans out parallel research across the source categories
→ Cross-references people search + LinkedIn alumni + property records
→ Verifies identity through timeline analysis
→ Reports findings with HIGH confidence
```

**Example 2: Reverse Phone Lookup**
```
User: "Who called from 512-555-1234?"
→ Routes to ReverseLookup.md
→ Runs phone through CallerID, NumLookup
→ Cross-references with people search aggregators
→ Reports owner name, location, carrier
```

**Example 3: Social Media Investigation**
```
User: "Find Jane Doe's social media, she's a marketing professional in Denver"
→ Routes to SocialMediaSearch.md
→ LinkedIn Boolean search + Google x-ray
→ Username enumeration if handle discovered
→ Reports all accounts with MEDIUM/HIGH confidence
```

## Gotchas

- **Ethical framework is mandatory.** Legitimate purposes only — reconnection, due diligence, safety. No stalking or harassment.
- **Wide parallel fan-out can hit rate limits on public records APIs.** Stagger launches if services throttle.
- **Verify findings across multiple sources.** Single-source results are unreliable.

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"PrivateInvestigator","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
