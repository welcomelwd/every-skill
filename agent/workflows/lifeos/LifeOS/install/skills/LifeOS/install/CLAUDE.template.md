# LifeOS 7.28.3 — the Life Operating System

> **LifeOS is the AI harness that moves you from current state to ideal state — an intent engineering platform. The DA is the principal's AI assistant. Pulse is the Life Dashboard.**
> Canonical thesis: `LIFEOS/DOCUMENTATION/LifeOs/LifeOsThesis.md`. Everyone running LifeOS names their own DA. LifeOS targets AS3 on the LifeOS Maturity Model, with lineage from "The Real Internet of Things" (2016).

# Identity @-imports below are activated by the agentic `/LifeOS setup` (via `skills/LifeOS/Tools/ActivateImports.ts`) once the principal scaffolds USER files.
# Claude Code does not follow transitive @-imports, so each must be listed here directly.
# @LIFEOS/USER/TELOS/PRINCIPAL_TELOS.md
# @LIFEOS/USER/PRINCIPAL/PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY.md

# @LIFEOS/USER/CONFIG/OPERATIONAL_RULES.md

## Constitutional layer

Constitutional rules, the unified response format, verification doctrine, hard prohibitions, security protocol, and operational rules all live in the system prompt: `LIFEOS/LIFEOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`. When this file and the system prompt disagree, the system prompt wins.

This file is the **routing table** — it tells you where everything lives. The only mandatory startup `@`-import shipped with public LifeOS is `ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY`. The five identity files (`PRINCIPAL_TELOS`, `PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY`, `DA_IDENTITY`, `PROJECTS`, `OPERATIONAL_RULES`) are commented out above — the agentic `/LifeOS setup` (via `skills/LifeOS/Tools/ActivateImports.ts`) uncomments them once the principal's USER scaffold is populated. Claude Code does not follow transitive `@`-imports from inside imported files, so each identity file must be listed here at top level. Everything below is **on-demand** lookup. Paths are relative to `~/.claude/` unless noted.

## Project-Specific Rules

Drop project-scoped CLAUDE.md files alongside each project (e.g. `~/code/your-project/CLAUDE.md`) for rules that only apply inside that codebase. Claude Code merges them with this global file when sessions start in that directory. Use them for invariants that bite repeatedly — "always use the X helper, never bare Y" — so the rule lives next to the code it governs.
