#!/usr/bin/env bash
# EnsureTestProfile.sh — make the Interceptor test context available, auto-launching
# the CONFIGURED test profile window if it isn't connected. Sanctioned auto-recovery
# for the "context not connected" preflight failures (exit 5 / 6) ONLY.
#
# WHY THIS IS SAFE (the invariant that reverses the old "never auto-launch" rule):
#   We ONLY ever succeed (exit 0) after PreflightIsolation.sh itself exits 0, which
#   whole-field-matches the connected context against INTERCEPTOR_TEST_CONTEXT_ID and
#   hard-denies Default/working profiles. So launching the WRONG window can never cause
#   the agent to drive it — preflight would still fail and this script would still stop.
#   The safety comes from the post-launch RE-VERIFICATION loop, not from trusting the
#   --profile-directory argument. Exit 7 (resolved target IS Default/working) and exit 8
#   (test context unset) NEVER trigger a launch.
#
# Contract: prints "READY" to stdout + exits 0 when the pinned test context is connected
# and safe. On any non-recoverable condition, surfaces the preflight remediation to
# stderr and exits with preflight's own code. Never falls back to Default. Never narrates.
#
# Usage:  bash Tools/EnsureTestProfile.sh        # ensure ready, auto-launch if needed
#         EnsureTestProfile.sh && interceptor open <url> --context "$INTERCEPTOR_TEST_CONTEXT_ID"
