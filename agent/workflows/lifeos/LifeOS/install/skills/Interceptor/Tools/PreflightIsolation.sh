# PreflightIsolation.sh — hard gate before any browser command lands in Chrome.
#
# Guarantees, enforced in code, that an interceptor browser verb cannot route to
# the operator's Default Chrome window or any working/monitoring profile:
#
#   1. Binary present + version >= MIN_VERSION. Older builds silently ignore
#      --context, so the daemon falls back to whatever Chrome it can find. Hard fail.
#
#   2. Pinned test context is connected — exact whole-field match on the UUID
#      (or friendly name) from preferences.env. A substring/header collision can't
#      false-pass. Hard fail if absent.
#
#   3. Target-deny: the resolved target is NOT Default and NOT in the
#      INTERCEPTOR_WORKING_PROFILE_IDS deny-list, and its name does not match a
#      Default/working pattern. This is the new guarantee — "connected" was the
#      old check; "target is provably not a working profile" is the contract now.
#
#   4. Extension present, then fresh. Absent Extension/ → hard fail (browser
#      control cannot work without it, and the freshness check below cannot see
#      this case: it is guarded on PINNED_FROM.txt, which is gone too). Then,
#      graceful: compare the pinned copy's PINNED_FROM.txt against the upstream
#      dist IF present. Mismatch → fail with re-pin remediation. Upstream absent
#      → WARN and continue (do not hard-fail on a missing reference).
#
# There is NO fallback path. A missing/stale pinned context is a hard stop with
# remediation, never an auto-route to Default. The old "fall back to the first
# available / Default context" behavior is DELETED and must never be re-derived.
#
# Every browser workflow's first step. Source from a workflow:
#
#   if ! bash ~/.claude/skills/Interceptor/Tools/PreflightIsolation.sh; then

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  Builds before $MIN_VERSION silently ignore the --context flag. The daemon

[PreflightIsolation] FAIL: no browser contexts connected.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  The Interceptor extension is not currently loaded in any Chrome profile, or
  the daemon was restarted after Chrome (so the extension hasn't re-handshaked).
  Without a connection, browser commands fail or hang.

REMEDIATION (operator action — no auto-launch):
  1. Open the dedicated Interceptor test profile window.
  2. In that profile, open chrome://extensions/. If the Interceptor card is
     missing or shows an error: Load Unpacked
       -> ~/.claude/skills/Interceptor/Extension/
     and accept any new permissions.
  3. Click the Interceptor toolbar icon, set Context ID to the friendly name
     "interceptor-test", Save. Friendly names survive extension reloads; raw
     UUIDs rot on every reload (see preferences.env header).
  4. Set INTERCEPTOR_TEST_CONTEXT_ID in preferences.env to match, then re-run.

[PreflightIsolation] FAIL: required context "$REQUIRED_CONTEXT" is not connected.

CURRENT CONTEXTS:
$(printf '%s\n' "$contexts_output" | sed 's/^/  /')

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  The whole point of the pinned test context is to give browser commands a known
  target that is NEVER the operator's working window. Without it connected, a
  command could land in the wrong profile or fail ambiguously. There is no
  fallback — this is a hard stop.

LIKELY CAUSE: UUID rotation. When Chrome's Interceptor extension reloads
(manifest version bump, "Load Unpacked" again, fresh profile), the auto-assigned
UUID changes and preferences.env still holds the OLD one. The live context in
CURRENT CONTEXTS above is the NEW one.

REMEDIATION (UUID rot — most common):
  1. Compare the UUID(s) above against INTERCEPTOR_TEST_CONTEXT_ID in
       ~/.claude/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/Interceptor/preferences.env
  2. If the live UUID is the same test profile under a new value, copy it into
     preferences.env and re-run this preflight.

DURABLE FIX (end UUID rot):
  Set the friendly name "interceptor-test" in the extension popup once and pin
  that string in preferences.env. Friendly names survive reloads; raw UUIDs do not.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  The pinned test context must never be the operator's Default or any
  working/monitoring profile. This is the isolation contract — a denied target
  is a hard stop, never a "proceed anyway."

REMEDIATION:
  Repin INTERCEPTOR_TEST_CONTEXT_ID in preferences.env to the dedicated
  Interceptor test context, and confirm INTERCEPTOR_WORKING_PROFILE_IDS lists
  every Default/working-profile context ID to keep them denied.

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  Browser control needs the unpacked extension loaded from this directory. It is
  a local pin of the built extension and is deliberately NOT shipped with the

  replacement. Chrome may still be running a copy from memory right now; that
  copy does not survive a restart.
