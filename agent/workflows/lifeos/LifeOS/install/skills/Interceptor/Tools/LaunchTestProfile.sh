# LaunchTestProfile.sh — open Chrome's dedicated non-default profile in its own window.
#
# Why this exists: the operator's Default Chrome profile holds the tabs they're actively
# working in (and the tabs their DA has been driving). Routine live testing goes to a
# separate Chrome profile so the agent never disturbs that window — BUT the test profile
# is signed into the operator's accounts (Google, GitHub, Cloudflare, blog admin, etc.)
# so live testing of authenticated tooling actually works.
#
# Mechanism: --profile-directory tells the existing Chrome installation which profile
# sub-directory to use. Same Chrome process tree, same root certificates, same native
# messaging hosts — different cookies, different tabs, different window. The operator
# creates the profile once via Chrome's avatar menu (top-right corner) and signs it into
# whichever accounts the agent needs to test against.
#
# This is the correct isolation boundary: separate WINDOW + separate COOKIE JAR, not
# separate user-data-dir. A `--user-data-dir` would be a fully sandboxed Chrome with no
# sessions — useless for verifying authenticated tools.

LaunchTestProfile.sh: FAIL — no test profile configured.

  INTERCEPTOR_TEST_CHROME_PROFILE is unset/empty. Set it in
    ~/.claude/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/Interceptor/preferences.env
  to the dedicated Interceptor test profile's on-disk directory name (e.g.
  "Profile N" — map directory -> friendly name via
  ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Local State, profile.info_cache).

  Refusing to launch: defaulting to any concrete profile could open the
  operator's working/monitoring profile by accident.
