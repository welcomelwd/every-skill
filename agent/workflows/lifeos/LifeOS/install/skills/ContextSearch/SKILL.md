# ContextSearch

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/ContextSearch/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.

## What It Does

Finds prior LifeOS work — sessions, ISAs, conversations — by topic, partial words, or date phrases like "yesterday" or "last week". A deterministic Bun CLI searches five sources in parallel, scores by token-overlap times recency, applies date filters, and returns ranked results with snippets.

## The Problem

Work spreads across sessions, ISAs, and conversation logs, and a week later you can't remember where a project lived or what it was called. Substring search misses it because you remember the gist, not the exact title. You need to recall half-remembered work fast — by a few words, or by "the thing I did yesterday" — and pick up where you left off without rereading everything by hand.

## How It Works

Search prior work for: **$ARGUMENTS**

The skill body delegates to a deterministic Bun CLI. The tool searches five sources in parallel, scores by token-overlap × recency, applies date filters, and returns ranked results.

## Workflow Routing

Single-tool skill — no `Workflows/` directory. Every invocation routes to the one CLI:

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| Search (inline) | context search, /cs, prior work, recall, find session, resume, date phrases | `Tools/ContextSearch.ts` |

## Run the search

```bash
bun run ~/.claude/skills/ContextSearch/Tools/ContextSearch.ts "$ARGUMENTS" --pretty --limit 10
```

The tool auto-detects TTY for output mode; explicit `--pretty` keeps the human-readable block when the skill is invoked from inside a Claude Code session (where stdout is not a true TTY). Pipe to `--json` for structured output to jq.

## Useful flag patterns

```bash
# Limit results
bun run ~/.claude/skills/ContextSearch/Tools/ContextSearch.ts "$ARGUMENTS" --limit 5

# Constrain by date
bun run ~/.claude/skills/ContextSearch/Tools/ContextSearch.ts "$ARGUMENTS" --since 2026-05-01

# JSON for programmatic use
bun run ~/.claude/skills/ContextSearch/Tools/ContextSearch.ts "$ARGUMENTS" --json | jq '.results[0]'
```

The tool also parses date phrases inline: `"yesterday markdown"` becomes a bounded since/until of yesterday only, plus token search for `markdown`.

## Usage Modes

1. **Standalone** — Run the search, present the pretty block, say: "Context loaded on [topic]. Most recent: [X]. What would you like to do?"
2. **Paired with request** — Run the search first, then execute the request informed by found context. If a result's `path` looks promising, Read it for full detail.

## Output shape

The pretty block:

```
═══ CONTEXT: <query> ═══════════════════════

📋 RESULTS (N, newest+best first):
  • <slug>
    task: ... | phase: ... | progress: ... | effort: ... | <recency>d ago | score: ... | sources: ...
    ↳ "<snippet from matched source>"
    <path to ISA or jsonl>

Searched: work.json=N, names=N, dirs=N, isa=N, jsonl=N
════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

JSON: `{ query, cleaned_query, tokens, since, until, stats, results: [{ source[], slug, sessionUuid, name, task, phase, progress, effort, score, recencyDays, snippet, path }] }`

## Gotchas

- **Token-overlap scoring, not substring matching.** Queries like `markdown extended` find sessions named `Research Type Markdown Extended Images` even though "markdown extended" is not a substring of that name. The query is tokenized (lowercase, `[^a-z0-9]+` split, stopwords removed) and any candidate that shares ≥1 non-stopword token gets scored.
- **Date phrases are first-class.** `today`, `yesterday`, `day before yesterday`, `last week`, `last month`, `N days ago`, and `YYYY-MM-DD` parse out of the query as bounded date filters; the remaining tokens still score against content. `yesterday` and `today` use single-day windows (since AND until); `last week` uses a 7-day rolling window.
- **JSONL-source date is the first user-message timestamp, not file mtime.** Conversation jsonl files get touched whenever Claude Code re-reads them, so mtime drifts. The tool parses the first `type:"user"` line's `timestamp` to recover the actual session start date — that's what date filters compare against.
- **Search is restricted to the `~/.claude` project's own conversation directory under `~/.claude/Projects/` for jsonl content** (dir name derived from `$HOME` at runtime — path with `/` and `.` mapped to `-`). Other Claude project directories on the same machine are out of scope by design.
- **No persistent index.** Every query rescans from disk. ripgrep over ~9k jsonl files completes in ~1s; total query latency is typically 1–2s, well within interactive perception. If a future scale change makes that unworkable, an opt-in cached index (e.g., per-jsonl first-user-timestamp + word-frequency map) is the v2.
- **Standalone vs paired.** When the user invokes ContextSearch alone (`/cs <topic>`), present results and ask what they want to do. When invoked as a paired primer to an unrelated request, run the search silently and use the top results to anchor the answer — don't dump the search block into the response unless the user asked.
- **Session-names.json date is jsonl mtime (best-available fallback).** Some session UUIDs don't appear in work.json or as `MEMORY/WORK/` directories — they're conversation-only sessions whose only structural trace is the auto-generated name. For those, the tool uses jsonl mtime for recency. If the file's been re-read recently the date will skew newer than the actual conversation.

## After Results

**Standalone:** "Context loaded on [topic]. Most recent: [X]. What would you like to do?"

**Paired:** Proceed with the user's request, anchored by the top result's context. If deeper detail is needed, Read the specific path the tool returned.

## Examples

**Example 1: Resume work on a specific topic**
```
User: "what did we do with the Telegram bot?"
→ bun run Tools/ContextSearch.ts "telegram bot"
→ Tokens [telegram, bot] hit work.json + ISA bodies + jsonl
→ Returns telegram-monitor-revival, fix-telegram-channels-plugin-broken, ranked by recency
```

**Example 2: Find half-remembered session**
```
User: "open up that test extended markdown document that you made yesterday"
→ bun run Tools/ContextSearch.ts "test extended markdown document yesterday"
→ Date phrase 'yesterday' parses out → since/until = 2026-05-07 only
→ Tokens [test, extended, markdown, document] hit jsonl content
→ Returns "Research Type Markdown Extended Images" session in top-3 with snippet
```

**Example 3: Date-only browsing**
```
User: "what did I work on last week?"
→ bun run Tools/ContextSearch.ts "last week"
→ Date phrase parses to since=7d-ago, no token filter
→ Returns all sessions from the past 7 days, newest first
```

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"ContextSearch","workflow":"Search","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```
