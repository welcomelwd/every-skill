## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/Science/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the Science skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **Science** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

# Science - The Universal Algorithm

## What It Does

Applies the scientific method as a general problem-solving algorithm: define the goal first, generate multiple hypotheses, design experiments that can fail, measure honestly, analyze against the goal, iterate. Seven core workflows plus two diagnostic shortcuts (quick 15-minute debugging and structured multi-factor investigation). It scales from micro (TDD) to meso (feature validation) to macro (MVP launch).

## The Problem

Most problem-solving is guessing dressed up as work. You pick the first idea that comes to mind, change something, and call it done when it "seems better" — which is confirmation bias, not progress. Without a clear definition of success you can't tell whether a change helped, so you keep tweaking forever or stop too early. Single-hypothesis thinking means you only ever test the idea you already believed. This skill forces the discipline that fixes all of that: a stated goal, at least three competing hypotheses, falsifiable tests, and measurement that compares to the goal rather than to your hopes.

## How It Works

The whole thing is one repeating cycle, and the goal anchors it — without clear success criteria you cannot judge results:

```
GOAL -----> What does success look like?
   |
OBSERVE --> What is the current state?
   |
HYPOTHESIZE -> What might work? (Generate MULTIPLE)
   |
EXPERIMENT -> Design and run the test
   |
MEASURE --> What happened? (Data collection)
   |
ANALYZE --> How does it compare to the goal?
   |
ITERATE --> Adjust hypothesis and repeat
   |
   +------> Back to HYPOTHESIZE
```

The answer emerges from the cycle, not from guessing.

## Anti-Patterns

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Make it better" | "Reduce load time from 3s to 1s" |
| "I think X will work" | "Here are 3 approaches: X, Y, Z" |
| "Prove I'm right" | "Design test that could disprove" |
| "Pretend failure didn't happen" | "What did we learn?" |
| "Keep experimenting forever" | "Ship and learn from production" |

## Gotchas

- **Minimum 3 hypotheses before testing.** Single-hypothesis testing is confirmation bias — going straight to a single test is trial-and-error, not science.
- **Measurements must be specific and reproducible.** "It seems better" is not a measurement.
- **Full cycle is for systematic investigation.** For quick debugging, use quick diagnosis mode.

## Examples

**Example 1: Quick diagnosis**
```
User: "figure out why Surface time filters show stale items"
→ Quick diagnosis mode
→ Hypothesis: timestamp format mismatch in D1
→ Test: query D1 for actual stored format
→ Analyze: compare stored vs expected format
→ Result: ISO string vs Unix timestamp mismatch
```

**Example 2: Full systematic investigation**
```
User: "experiment with different prompt structures for better output"
→ Full cycle mode
→ 3+ hypotheses generated
→ Controlled experiments with measurements
→ Analysis identifies winning approach
→ Iterates until convergence
```

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Science","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
