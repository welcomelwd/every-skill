Running **Essay** in **Art**...

---

Uses architectural sketching STYLE (gestural lines, hatching, charcoal) to depict whatever the content is actually ABOUT — NOT defaulting to buildings.

---

## The 8-step pipeline

Each step produces an input the next one depends on, so the sequence runs end to end. CSE-24 before composition, generate before optimize, optimize before validate.

```
INPUT CONTENT
     ↓
[1] UNDERSTAND: Deeply read and comprehend the request
     ↓
[2] CSE-24: Run Create Story Explanation Level 24 on content
     ↓
[3] EMOTION: Identify emotional register
     ↓
[4] COMPOSITION: Design what to ACTUALLY DRAW
     ↓
[5] PROMPT: Construct using charcoal sketch TECHNIQUE template
     ↓
[6] GENERATE: Execute CLI tool with --thumbnail flag
     ↓
[7] OPTIMIZE: Resize, convert to WebP, create optimized thumbnails
     ↓
[8] VALIDATE: Subject matches content? Signature? Gallery-worthy?
```

**Every image contains these elements:**
- Charcoal sketch technique
- Content-relevant subject matter
- **BURNT SIENNA (#8B4513)** — human warmth, humanity
- **DEEP PURPLE (#4A148C)** — technology, AI, capital, cold power
- --thumbnail flag for blog headers

**NO TEXT IN IMAGES — exactly one exception: the "{{DA_NAME}}" signature.**
- ✅ **The "{{DA_NAME}}" signature IS REQUIRED** — every blog-header image MUST be signed "{{DA_NAME}}", bottom-right corner, added PROGRAMMATICALLY in Step 7 (never prompted into the model — models hallucinate garbled text). This is the SOLE permitted mark. (Principal directive 2026-06-20: re-required after the 2026-05-02 removal; it must always be there.)
- 🚨 The signature is a **human handwriting** style, NOT formal calligraphy. Use `SignPainter-HouseScript` — cursive human-signature hand, small (~3% of width), semi-transparent charcoal, tucked into the composition (2026-07-09 directive: more cursive, smaller, part of the image). Formal calligraphy faces Snell-Roundhand / Apple-Chancery / Savoye remain WRONG (2026-06-20: "It's a human like signature not fucking caligraphy").
- ❌ No OTHER text: no watermarks, no labels, no annotations, no captions, no logos, no titles, no subtitles
- ❌ No readable text of any kind beyond the "{{DA_NAME}}" signature — even the model hallucinating partial words counts as failure
- The image carries the meaning visually. All text other than the {{DA_NAME}} signature belongs in the post body, not on the canvas.
- The model MUST NOT bake any text in. The ONLY text on the final image is the Step-7 programmatic "{{DA_NAME}}" signature.

**Both sienna and purple appear in every image.**
- Sienna on human/warm elements
- Purple on tech/capital/cold elements
- The ratio of Sienna:Purple tells the emotional story
- An image missing either color is incomplete

**Never include:**
- ❌ Borders or frames around the image
- ❌ Background shading or gradients
- ❌ Filled backgrounds of any kind
- ❌ Decorative elements that aren't part of the subject
- The composition should float in empty space — MINIMALIST

**🚨 LOGICAL/PHILOSOPHICAL CONSISTENCY:**
- The visual MUST make logical sense with the concept
- If "X is winning" — X should be in the dominant/winning position visually
- If "X is heavy/powerful" — X weighs DOWN, not up
- If using a balance scale: the winning/heavy side pushes DOWN
- THINK about what the metaphor actually means before drawing it

**⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE: Background removal may remove the signature.**
If the signature is missing after generation, you must add it manually or regenerate with the signature more integrated into the composition (not isolated in corner with empty space).

---

## Step 1: Deeply Understand the Request

**Before doing ANYTHING, deeply read and understand:**

1. **What is the content?** Read the full blog post, essay, or input material
2. **What is it ABOUT?** Not surface-level — the actual core concept/argument
3. **What are the key concrete elements?** Nouns, metaphors, imagery FROM the content
4. **What should NOT be drawn?** Architecture, buildings, vast spaces — UNLESS the content is about those
5. **Did the user provide GUIDANCE?** If the user gave direction about what to focus on, what the image should convey, or what angle to take — THIS TAKES PRIORITY over your own interpretation

**🚨 USER GUIDANCE TAKES PRIORITY:**
If the user provides specific direction like:
- "Focus on the tension between X and Y"
- "The image should show Z losing"
- "Emphasize the human impact"
- Any other compositional or thematic guidance

**USE THAT GUIDANCE** as the primary input for composition design. The CSE-24 supports the user's direction — it doesn't override it.

**Output:** Clear understanding of the content's core subject matter + any user-provided guidance.

---

## Step 2: Run Create Story Explanation Level 24

**Extract the FULL narrative arc to understand the emotional core.**

Run this command — its 24-item output is the source material for the composition in Steps 3-5:

```
Invoke the StoryExplanation Skill with: "Create a 24-item story explanation for this content"
```

Or use the slash command:
```
/cse [paste the content or URL]
```

**What CSE-24 gives you:**
- The complete narrative arc: setup, tension, transformation, resolution
- Key metaphors and imagery from the piece
- The emotional journey
- What the piece is REALLY about
- The "wow" factor and significance

**Step 3 builds on three outputs from here:**
1. The CSE command has actually run
2. The 24-item output is read and understood
3. The key metaphors and emotional beats are identified

**Output:** 24-item story explanation revealing the emotional and conceptual core.

---

## Step 3: Identify Emotional Register

**Read the aesthetic file and select the appropriate emotional vocabulary.**

```bash
Read ~/.claude/skills/Art/SKILL.md
```

**Match the contVent to one of these emotional registers:**

| Register | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **DREAD / FEAR** | AI takeover, existential risk, loss of control |
| **HOPE / POSSIBILITY** | Human potential, growth, positive futures |
| **CONTEMPLATION** | Philosophy, meaning, deep questions |
| **URGENCY / WARNING** | Security threats, calls to action |
| **WONDER / DISCOVERY** | Breakthroughs, encountering the vast |
| **DETERMINATION / EFFORT** | Overcoming obstacles, "gym" work |
| **MELANCHOLY / LOSS** | Endings, what's lost to progress |
| **CONNECTION / KINDNESS** | Human bonds, community |

**Output:** Selected emotional register with specific vocabulary from the aesthetic file.

These are just examples. It can be really anything which you will get from the Create Story Explanation Run. 

---

## Step 4: Design Composition

**🚨 CRITICAL: Design what to ACTUALLY DRAW based on the CONTENT — NOT defaulting to architecture.**

### The Core Question

**What is this content ABOUT, and what visual would represent THAT?**

**🚨 IF USER PROVIDED GUIDANCE — START THERE:**
If the user gave direction in Step 1 (e.g., "focus on the tension between labor and capital", "show labor losing"), use that as your PRIMARY composition direction. The CSE-24 output SUPPORTS this direction — it doesn't replace it.

Use the content from the create-story-explanation run to compose this.

- Architecture is the TECHNIQUE (how to draw), NOT the required subject
- Only draw buildings/spaces if the content is about those things
- Draw what the content is actually about using architectural sketch style
- **User guidance shapes WHAT to draw; CSE-24 helps you understand the emotional core**

### Composition Design Questions

**🚨 STEP 4A: IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM (MOST CRITICAL)**

Before designing anything, extract from the CSE-24 output:

1. **What is the PROBLEM the essay addresses?**
   - What's WRONG with the current state?
   - What unfairness, mistake, or confusion exists?
   - What are people doing wrong that this essay corrects?
   - **The art should SHOW THIS PROBLEM visually**

2. **What TYPE of problem is it?**

   Identify the problem archetype from the CSE output:

   | Problem Type | Description | Visual Metaphor |
   |--------------|-------------|-----------------|
   | **SORTING/CLASSIFICATION** | Need to categorize things into the right buckets | Scattered items + empty labeled bins |
   | **COMMUNICATION** | Can't express ideas clearly, talking past each other | Tangled speech, broken telephone |
   | **DOUBLE STANDARD** | Same thing judged differently based on source | Tilted scales, unfair judges |
   | **MISDIRECTION** | Focusing on wrong thing, missing the real issue | Looking left while danger is right |
   | **OVERWHELM** | Too much to process, can't see clearly | Flood of items, buried figure |
   | **MISSING FRAMEWORK** | No structure to organize thinking | Chaos vs. empty scaffolding |
   | **FALSE DICHOTOMY** | Forced choice that ignores better options | Two doors, hidden third path |
   | **COMPLEXITY** | Simple thing made unnecessarily complicated | Tangled vs. straight path |
   | **BLINDSPOT** | Can't see obvious thing right in front | Figure ignoring elephant |

   **🚨 THE PROBLEM TYPE SHAPES THE VISUAL METAPHOR.**
   - SORTING problem → show the sorting challenge (scattered items, categories)
   - COMMUNICATION problem → show the breakdown (garbled speech, confusion)
   - DOUBLE STANDARD → show the unfairness (tilted scales, biased judge)

   **Examples with problem types:**
   - ATHI framework → Problem TYPE: SORTING — "When you have a threat, which category does it belong to?"
   - AI judgment essay → Problem TYPE: DOUBLE STANDARD — "Same output judged differently based on source"
   - Security theater → Problem TYPE: MISDIRECTION — "Focus on visible but ineffective measures"
   - Meaning essay → Problem TYPE: MISDIRECTION — "Chasing status instead of purpose"

   **THE ART SHOULD MAKE THE PROBLEM TYPE VISIBLE AT A GLANCE.**
   Someone seeing the image should immediately understand WHAT KIND of problem this is.

   ### Opposite-Concept Asymmetry Gate

   **When the essay's argument contrasts TWO different things (X vs Y, capitalism vs communism, agency vs control, human vs AI, ruthless vs compassionate, centralized vs distributed, etc.), the image shows X and Y with DISTINCT VISUAL CHARACTER — not symmetric color-coded voids, mirror-image silhouettes, or "same shape, different paint."**

   This gate exists because models default to producing visually-symmetric compositions (left blob purple, right blob sienna; left pan-of-scale, right pan-of-scale). Symmetry collapses meaning. The viewer cannot tell which side is which conceptually because they LOOK THE SAME except for color. Exactly this failure was rejected in review on 2026-05-20 — the image did not visually separate the two contrasted styles of government — never repeat it.

   **The failure modes this catches:**

   - ❌ "Left side purple void, right side sienna void" — colored abysses without conceptual content
   - ❌ "Balance scale with two pans, one purple, one sienna" — same shape, different paint
   - ❌ "Mirror-image silhouettes" — symmetric forms with different washes
   - ❌ "Two doors / two paths / two voids" — generic dichotomy imagery that could mean anything

   **The required move — Iconographic Asymmetry:**

   1. **List the two contrasting concepts the essay actually critiques** (not generic "left vs right" — the specific things).
   2. **For each concept, list 2-4 iconic visual signatures that an educated reader would recognize INSTANTLY** as that concept's failure mode. Pull from real-world iconography people already associate with that idea.
   3. **Each side of the composition gets its own distinct imagery** — not just a color wash on a symmetric shape. The shapes themselves must be different.
   4. **Color is the wash on the iconic imagery, NOT a replacement for it.**
   5. **Test the result**: if you stripped all color and showed someone the black-and-white image, could they still tell which side is which? If no, the asymmetry isn't iconographic — fix the shapes.

   **Worked example — Capitalism vs Communism essay:**

   | Side | Concept's failure mode | Iconic imagery (pick 2-3) | Color wash |
   |------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|
   | LEFT (communism failure) | Compassion-feeling → centralized super-class crushing the spirit, uniformity, all-powerful state | Monolithic brutalist statue/watchtower with a single dominating figure or eye; rows of identical faceless figures in lockstep below; brutalist concrete blocks; surveillance/watchtower silhouette | Deep purple #4A148C wash |
   | RIGHT (capitalism failure) | Cruelty-feeling → malignant inequality when unchecked, chaos, exploitation | Gilded skyscraper / glittering spire with a tiny beggar/destitute figure at its base; smokestacks belching smoke; oligarch silhouette on a gilded throne; sharp wealth contrast between palace and slum | Burnt sienna #8B4513 wash |

   **Worked example — Human vs AI essay:**

   | Side | Iconic imagery | Color |
   |------|----------------|-------|
   | Human | Outstretched hand reaching, gestural warm body, organic flowing strokes, paper texture | Sienna |
   | AI | Geometric rigid grid, circuit-board angularity, eye/lens, cold scaffolding | Purple |

   **Worked example — Agency vs Control essay:**

   | Side | Iconic imagery | Color |
   |------|----------------|-------|
   | Agency | Open hands, multiple paths radiating outward, figure at a crossroads choosing | Sienna |
   | Control | Single corridor with walls closing in, figure on rails, hand puppeting from above | Purple |

   **Hard gate before proceeding to Step 5:**
   - [ ] I have written down the two contrasting concepts in plain language
   - [ ] I have listed 2-4 iconic visual signatures per side
   - [ ] The two sides of the composition use DIFFERENT shapes, not the same shape in different colors
   - [ ] I have explicitly prompted for each side's iconography (not "left side purple void" but "left side: monolithic statue with rows of faceless figures, deep purple wash")
   - [ ] If I stripped color, the image would still read as "X-failure vs Y-failure"

   If you cannot fill in the iconography table for the essay, STOP — re-read the content. The image fails when the prompt writer hasn't actually identified what the two opposing concepts visually LOOK LIKE.

3. **What are the CONCRETE SUBJECTS in the content?**
   - Extract specific nouns, metaphors, imagery FROM the content
   - "Bowling pins" → draw bowling pins
   - "Hands juggling" → draw hands juggling
   - "Balance between capital and labor" → draw a balance/scale metaphor
   - **The visual should match the content's core concept**

4. **What VISUAL METAPHOR represents the PROBLEM?**
   - What image would make someone say "Oh, I see what's wrong"?
   - If the piece uses a metaphor USE THAT
   - If no metaphor, what scene captures the problematic situation?
   - **Show the unfairness, the mistake, the confusion**

5. **Should there be FIGURES showing the problem?**
   - Judges applying double standards
   - People ignoring obvious issues
   - Actors making the mistake the essay critiques
   - The dynamic that needs to change

6. **What is the EMOTIONAL treatment?**
   - The emotion should match the PROBLEM being shown
   - Unfairness → show the contrast, the tipped scale
   - Confusion → show the misdirection, the wrong focus
   - Loss → show what's fading, being ignored

7. **What is the COMPOSITION?**
   - Centered, minimalist, breathing space
   - Arrange to make the PROBLEM OBVIOUS
   - The viewer should "get it" immediately
   - NOT busy, NOT cluttered

## Step 5: Construct the Prompt

**Use deep thinking to construct the final prompt using the charcoal sketch TECHNIQUE template.**

### Prompt Template

```
Sophisticated charcoal sketch using architectural rendering TECHNIQUE.

THE PROBLEM THIS ESSAY ADDRESSES (from Step 4 — drives the entire composition):
[What's WRONG with the current state that this essay critiques?]
[The art should make this problem VISIBLE AT A GLANCE]

SUBJECT (WHAT TO DRAW — showing the problem):
[The actual visual subject that makes the PROBLEM visible]
[NOT defaulting to architecture — draw what makes the problem clear]

EMOTIONAL REGISTER: [From Step 3]

TECHNIQUE — GESTURAL ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH STYLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚨 Architecture is the TECHNIQUE, not the required subject 🚨
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- GESTURAL — quick, confident, energetic marks
- OVERLAPPING LINES — multiple strokes suggesting form
- HATCHING — cross-hatching creates depth and tone
- Loose charcoal/graphite pencil strokes throughout
- Variable line weight, some lines trailing off
- NOT clean vectors, NOT smooth
- Like Paul Rudolph, Lebbeus Woods sketches

LINEWORK (applies to ALL subjects):
- [Specific line quality from emotional vocabulary]
- Visible hatching and gestural marks
- UNIFIED sketch quality across all elements

HUMAN FIGURES (if present) — GESTURAL ABSTRACTED:
- MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING LINES suggesting the form
- Quick, confident, ENERGETIC gestural marks
- HATCHING and cross-hatching to create tone/depth
- 20-40 overlapping strokes creating the form
- Form EMERGES from accumulated linework
- Abstracted but with PRESENCE and WEIGHT
- FACES via simple charcoal marks (dark strokes for eyes, line for mouth)
- Burnt Sienna (#8B4513) WASH accent
- DIVERSITY IN GROUPS (2026-07-12 principal directive): when the scene has
  MULTIPLE figures, they must show a natural range of skin tones — in this
  medium that means varied wash hues and tonal depths across figures (light
  sienna, deep umber, warm brown, charcoal-dark), plus varied hair textures
  and silhouettes. Models default every figure to white; say it explicitly
  in the prompt ("figures with a natural variety of skin tones"). Don't
  overdo it or tokenize — just never render an all-white group.

HANDS (if present) — GESTURAL:
- Same overlapping line technique
- Form suggested through accumulated marks
- Sienna wash accent for human warmth

OBJECTS (if present) — GESTURAL SUGGESTED FORMS:
- Objects implied through hatching and gestural strokes
- Same energetic sketch quality
- Recognizable forms through accumulated lines
- NOT flat symbols — sketched with depth

COMPOSITION — FULL FRAME WITH BREATHING ROOM (target band: 7–12% margin on every edge):
- 🚨 SUBJECTS MUST DOMINATE the frame, NOT be small islands in empty space
- Target margin band: each of the four edges should have **between 7% and 12% empty space** (transparent or background-color) — not zero, not 20%+
- Hard FAILS:
  - Any edge with **less than 5% margin** → subject is butting against the edge, looks visually clipped (the 2026-04-27 "flat against the side" failure)
  - Any edge with **more than 15% margin** → subject is too small, wallpaper margin (the original failure that caused FillFrame to exist)
- The prompt MUST request: "the subject fills most of the frame with a small comfortable margin around all four edges — roughly 8% breathing room on top, bottom, left, and right"
- Models routinely produce one of the two failure modes (zero margin OR wallpaper margin). The pipeline corrects both via FillFrame.ts (refills wallpaper) + a post-pad step (adds breathing room).
- MINIMALIST means few elements, NOT small elements lost in empty space.

COLOR — CHARCOAL DOMINANT, COLORS AS ACCENTS ONLY:
- CHARCOAL AND GRAY DOMINANT — 70-80% of image
- Colors INTEGRATED INTO forms — not splattered or applied on top
- Colors are the ESSENCE of elements (purple = cold capital, sienna = human warmth)
- Every bit of color belongs to a form — no random color floating in space

DO NOT include any signature text in the prompt — AI models hallucinate garbled text instead of clean signatures. The DA signature will be added programmatically in the Optimize step using ImageMagick.
NO other text.
```

### Step 5A: Best-Image Deliberation (principal directive 2026-07-09)

**Before writing any prompt, stop and think deeply about what the BEST POSSIBLE image for THIS essay would be.** Not "what subjects should appear" — what image would make the argument land hardest. The 2026-07-09 Claude Tag session proved the gap: subject-list prompts ("a desk with a laptop, an AI figure, a colleague") produced flat tableaus that got rejected twice; a composition reasoned from the essay's actual argument (a chat window as thin facade, a robot workshop behind it passing work up) produced immediately-accepted images. Same models, same technique block — the difference was the deliberation.

The deliberation, in order:

1. **Name the essay's central mechanism or tension in one sentence.** Not the topic — the thing the essay actually argues (e.g. "the mundane chat surface hides an industrial workforce").
2. **Ask: what scene would make a stranger FEEL that in one look?** Generate 2-3 genuinely different scene concepts before picking. Consider (as options, not rules): architectural devices the charcoal technique loves — cutaway, cross-section, facade/backstage, multi-floor, iceberg; scale contrast; before/after split; a single frozen action.
3. **Give every element a narrative ROLE and a spatial relationship** — X feeds into Y, Z carries W up to V. If an element is just "present," cut it or connect it. This is what separates a scene from a tableau.
4. **Demand continuity and density in the prompt**: "one connected structure, nothing floats in isolation." This both reads better and survives background removal (isolated fragments are what rembg destroys).
5. **Sanity-check against the failure modes**: would this read at thumbnail size? Does it need readable text to work (it must not)? Does the argument survive with color stripped?

The scene concept from this step BECOMES the composition brief for both model prompts. The prompt is written as a STORY of the scene, not a list of its contents.

**Interior-white ban (2026-07-09, "giant white space" incident):** never prompt interior surfaces — desks, panels, windows, paper stacks — as bright white, and never leave surface color unstated (models default to white). State "warm cream paper tone" for any large flat surface so it blends with the sepia page. A baked-white desk or window survives background removal as a giant white rectangle on the cream blog page. Same class as the 2026-06-20 white-box bug, but INSIDE the subject where rembg can't help.

### Prompt Quality Check

Before generating, verify:
- [ ] **BEST-IMAGE DELIBERATION ran** (Step 5A) — the composition came from reasoning about the essay's argument, not from a default subject list
- [ ] **PROBLEM IS VISIBLE** — someone could understand what's wrong just from the image
- [ ] **Concrete subjects present** — nouns from title/content appear visually (not abstracted)
- [ ] Emotional register explicitly stated
- [ ] Figure treatment shows the problematic dynamic (if applicable)
- [ ] Light source and meaning specified
- [ ] Warm:cool ratio matches emotion
- [ ] "Charcoal sketch", "gestural", "hatching" explicitly stated
- [ ] Artist reference appropriate to emotion
- [ ] SPECIFIC to this content (couldn't be about something else)
- [ ] **Title test** — could someone guess the title from the image alone?

**Output:** A complete prompt ready for generation.

### 🚨 Prompt Construction (CONTENT-LED)

**`nano-banana-pro` is the only model this workflow uses.** OpenAI image models and the dual-provider `compare` mode were removed 2026-07-30 at the principal's direction — do not reintroduce them, and do not reach for a second vendor when a round fails the gate. The fix for a failed round is a sharper brief, not another provider.

Google's `nano-banana-pro` (Gemini 3 Pro Image) is visually-anchored — it executes composition and style with high fidelity, but it produces stronger results when the composition is grounded in WHY the scene exists, not just WHAT objects to draw. Lead with composition, but include the thesis as context so the model treats the elements as load-bearing instead of decorative.

**Verified quirks to write against:**

- **🚨 It will not render a large field of dense technical linework, and no amount of prompting fixes it.** Asking for a drafting sheet / plan / grid "packed corner to corner with hundreds of overlapping projection lines" reliably produces the subjects (figures, hands, objects) beautifully rendered and the rest of the canvas BLANK. Verified across 8 rolls on 2026-07-30 — including explicit canvas-fraction instructions ("the drawn linework must cover at least 60 percent of the canvas"), naming the field as THE SUBJECT, and stating which single region is allowed to be bare. All ignored. **The fix is the BRIEF, not the wording:** build the composition from SOLID MASSES the model renders well — hatched terrain, slabs, faceted forms, gestural figures with sienna wash, ledges and shears — and never make a fine-line field load-bearing. The singularity header landed the moment "dense drawing that frays" became "solid hatched ledge that shears off."
- **It obeys "minimalist" and "floats in empty space" literally.** Those words are in the technique block; when the composition needs weight, say what fills each region instead of relying on the block's defaults.
- **Scale contrast is a strength — use it.** Tiny sienna figures against a colossal purple mass reads instantly at thumbnail size and survives the alpha cut cleanly.

**Every prompt MUST include three blocks, in this order:**

1. **Thesis brief** — 2–4 sentences distilling the essay: the argument, the tension, what the reader should feel, and what a stranger should intuit from the image alone.
2. **Visual brief** — the composition / subject / palette / style. Strict edge-to-edge composition rules from `Step 4: Design Composition`. If the scene includes multiple figures, the visual brief explicitly requests a natural variety of skin tones across them (varied wash hues/tonal depths) — never an all-white group.
3. **Anti-pattern list** — what to avoid (literal corporate clichés if it's a workplace essay, digital-vector look, text/logos/watermarks, blank margins).

#### The prompt shape — COMPOSITION-LED (thesis is the load-bearing context)

```
Editorial illustration filling the entire square frame edge-to-edge,
NO blank margins. The image illustrates a New Yorker-style essay about
[topic in one phrase]: [2–3 sentence thesis brief — what the essay argues,
what the reader should feel].

Composition: [dominant subject described concretely with placement, scale,
linework]. [Supporting elements with placement and edge-coverage].
Strict composition: [what occupies what % of canvas, what touches which
edges, ZERO blank space]. Style: bold charcoal and warm sepia ink,
hand-drawn gestural strokes with hatching for depth, painterly New Yorker
editorial polish. NOT digital, NOT vector. Palette: charcoal, warm sepia,
single soft amber accent.

No text, no labels, no signatures, no watermarks, no borders. Background:
seamless warm sepia paper that blends into a cream blog page.
```

### 🚨 DEFAULT FOR BLOG HEADERS: MULTI-CANDIDATE, AUTO-SELECT

**Single-generation is NOT the default for blog header essays.** Single-shot generation is fine for low-stakes diagrams, schematics, or technical illustrations where the visual answer is mechanical. Editorial essay headers are creative judgment calls, and the same brief produces meaningfully different compositions roll to roll.

**Default protocol for any blog header (Essay workflow): generate N candidates from `nano-banana-pro` in parallel, then auto-select via the Concept Fidelity Gate (Step 8).**

- **N defaults to 4**, each with a genuinely distinct compositional angle on the same thesis brief — different scene concepts, not the same scene reworded. The variation must come from YOUR angles, since there is no longer a second model supplying it.
- **Bump to 6 or 8** when the thesis is multi-part, the metaphor is non-obvious, or the previous round failed the gate.
- **Spawn all candidates as parallel background jobs** (`run_in_background: true`) — 4 parallel costs about the same wall-clock as 1 sequential.
- **All outputs go to `$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` (default `~/Downloads/` when unset)** with descriptive suffixes (`{slug}-candidate-{n}-{angle}.png`).
- **Then run the Concept Fidelity Gate (Step 8)** on each. Score every candidate against the thesis brief. Auto-select the highest-fidelity winner.
- **The winner moves through optimize → mv → git add. Losers stay in `$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` as disposable.**

**When to break the default and generate a single image:**

- The principal explicitly asks for one.
- The previous round selected a clear leader and the principal wants a tight variation on it.
- The image type is not editorial (diagram, schematic, dashboard, technical illustration).
- Total candidate count from prior rounds in this same task already exceeds 8 — you're approaching the 4-turn cap; surface to the principal instead of burning more compute.

| "with reference", "style like" | `--reference-image <path>` | Uses reference for style guidance |
| "variations", "options" | `--creative-variations 3` | Generates multiple versions |

### Default Model: nano-banana-pro

### Always Output to Downloads First — `$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` (default `~/Downloads/` when unset) IS THE WORKING DIRECTORY

**`$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` (default `~/Downloads/` when unset) is the canonical working directory for ALL Art-skill image generation. Every `--output` path starts with `$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` (default `~/Downloads/` when unset) — writing anywhere else bypasses the visual inspection gate below.**

This applies to:
- Single-shot generations (`--output "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/{name}.png`)
- Multi-candidate comparisons across models (`--output "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/{name}-candidate-{n}-{model}.png`)
- Thumbnail generation (`--thumbnail` flag — both `.png` and `-thumb.png` land in `$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` (default `~/Downloads/` when unset))
- Background-removal intermediates
- Optimization intermediates (`cwebp` / `magick` outputs while iterating)

**NEVER point `--output` directly at your blog/site's `public/images/` directory, the public/ tree of any project, or any git-tracked path.** Doing so bypasses the visual inspection gate and risks staging a bad image into git before any human or AI has actually seen it.

The strict pipeline:

```bash
# 1. GENERATE → ALWAYS to "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/
bun run ~/.claude/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --workflow=Essay \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --thumbnail \
  --output "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[descriptive-name].png

# 2. INSPECT → MANDATORY visual gate via the Read tool
#    (see Step 8 — you literally cannot validate the image without this)
#    Read("${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[descriptive-name].png")
#    nano-banana-pro often returns JPEG even for --output .png:
#    Read("${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[descriptive-name].jpg")

# 3. OPTIMIZE → still in "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/
cwebp -q 78 "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].png -o "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].webp
magick "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].png -resize 512x512 -colors 128 "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-thumb.png

# 4. MOVE → only after visual gate passes, only the chosen winner
mv "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].{png,webp,thumb.png} ~/your-site/public/images/

# 5. STAGE → git add the moved files
cd ~/your-site && git add public/images/[name].*
```

**If you generate multiple candidates for comparison, all of them stay in `$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` (default `~/Downloads/` when unset). Only the winner moves through steps 4–5. The losers stay in `$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` (default `~/Downloads/` when unset) (they're disposable; the principal's Downloads folder is the staging area, not a permanent archive).**

### Construct Command Based on Intent

Based on user's request and the mapping tables above, construct the CLI command:

```bash
bun run ~/.claude/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --workflow=Essay \
  --model [SELECTED_MODEL from table] \
  --prompt "[PROMPT from Step 5]" \
  --size [SELECTED_SIZE] \
  --aspect-ratio [SELECTED_RATIO] \
  [--thumbnail if blog header] \
  [--reference-image PATH if style reference provided] \
  [--creative-variations N if variations requested] \
  --output [OUTPUT_PATH]
```

### Blog Header Images → Use `--thumbnail`

**Blog header images use the `--thumbnail` flag** — it generates the two versions the blog needs (transparent inline + sepia social).

The `--thumbnail` flag generates TWO versions:
1. `output.png` — Transparent background (for compositing over website backgrounds)
2. `output-thumb.png` — With `#EAE9DF` background (for thumbnails, social previews, OpenGraph)

```bash
# Example: Generates both my-header.png AND my-header-thumb.png in "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/
# 🚨 --output MUST point to "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/ — NEVER directly into cms/public/images/
bun run ~/.claude/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --workflow=Essay \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[YOUR PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --thumbnail \
  --output "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/my-header.png

# After visual inspection passes (Step 8), move into your site's public tree:
mv "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/my-header.png "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/my-header-thumb.png \
   ~/your-site/public/images/
```

**Why two versions?**
- **Transparent (`output.png`):** For the blog post inline image — composites beautifully over website background
- **Thumbnail (`output-thumb.png`):** For `thumbnail:` frontmatter field — visible in social previews, RSS readers, and anywhere that doesn't composite transparency

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Blog Post Frontmatter Must Use `-thumb` Version

**ALWAYS reference the `-thumb` file in the blog post's `thumbnail:` frontmatter field:**

```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Use the -thumb version with sepia background
thumbnail: https://example.com/images/my-header-thumb.png

# ❌ WRONG - Transparent version shows white background on social media
thumbnail: https://example.com/images/my-header.png
```

**The inline image in the post body uses the transparent version:**
```markdown
[![Description](/images/my-header.png)](/images/my-header.png) <!-- width="1024" height="1024" -->
```

**Summary:**
| File | Background | Use For |
|------|------------|---------|
| `output.png` | Transparent | Inline blog image (composites over page background) |
| `output-thumb.png` | Sepia #EAE9DF | `thumbnail:` frontmatter, social previews, OpenGraph |

### Alternative: Standalone Background Removal

For non-blog images that only need transparency, or to remove backgrounds after generation:

```bash
# Use the Images Skill for background removal
bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/RemoveBg.ts /path/to/output.png

# Or batch process multiple images
bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/RemoveBg.ts image1.png image2.png image3.png
```


### 🚨 COMPOSITION: USE FULL FRAME, MINIMALIST, NO BACKGROUNDS

**SUBJECTS FILL THE FRAME. FEW ELEMENTS. NO FILLED BACKGROUNDS.**

**ALWAYS include in prompt:**
- "USE FULL FRAME — subjects fill horizontal and vertical space"
- "Subjects LARGE and DOMINANT in the composition"
- "MINIMALIST — few elements, each intentional"
- "NO filled-in backgrounds — composition floats in empty space"
- "Clean, uncluttered — gallery-worthy simplicity"

**Common failures:**
- ❌ WRONG: Subjects too small, too much empty space around them
- ❌ WRONG: Busy backgrounds with lots of detail
- ❌ WRONG: Filled-in architectural environments surrounding subject
- ❌ WRONG: Cluttered compositions with competing elements

**The fix:**
- ✅ RIGHT: Subjects LARGE, filling the frame
- ✅ RIGHT: Few elements, each intentional — gallery aesthetic
- ✅ RIGHT: No background fill — subjects float in white/transparent space
- ✅ RIGHT: Full use of horizontal and vertical dimensions

### Alternative Models

| Model | Command | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **flux** | `--model flux --size 1:1 --remove-bg` | Different aesthetic register, crisper linework |
| **nano-banana** | `--model nano-banana --size 1:1 --remove-bg` | Faster iteration when the composition is already settled |

### Immediately Open

```bash
open /path/to/output.png
```

## Step 7: Optimize Images

**🚨 CRITICAL: This step happens AFTER generation and background removal, BEFORE validation.**

### Step 7.0 — Tight-Crop Pass (no baked-in whitespace)

**Before any other optimization, every image is cropped tight to the subject bounding box — no extra padding, no breathing-room border baked into the image file itself.** The previous workflow added 8% padding which produced visible whitespace gaps above and below the rendered post header — rejected in review on 2026-05-02. Padding belongs in the page CSS layout, not inside the image.

```bash
# Stage A — magick -trim removes uniform-color/transparent borders to the bbox of opaque pixels.
magick "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].png -trim +repage "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-trimmed.png

# Stage B — resize the trimmed result to 1024 wide (preserve native aspect — DO NOT pad to square).
magick "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-trimmed.png -resize 1024x "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-resized.png

# Stage C — verify margins are now ≤ 2% on every edge (sanity check; any model whitespace inside
# the bbox stays, but cropping has eliminated background bleed).
bun ~/.claude/skills/Art/Tools/FillFrame.ts \
  "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-resized.png \
  "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-resized.png \
  --report-only \
  --max-margin 2 \
  --bg-color auto

# If Stage C reports margins > 2%, the model produced an image with internal whitespace inside
# the figure area — REGENERATE with a tighter composition prompt instead of padding it more.

mv "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-resized.png "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].png
rm "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-trimmed.png
```

**Skip conditions: NONE for the trim.** The trim is non-negotiable — every image goes through it. Aspect-ratio padding to force-square is FORBIDDEN; the rendered post does not need square images, and faking a square crops blank space INTO the file which renders as a visible layout gap.



### Why This Step Matters

Generated images at 2K resolution (2048x2048) are 6-8MB each - far too large for web use. Optimization reduces file sizes by 90-95% while maintaining visual quality, ensuring fast page loads and better user experience.

### Optimization Process

**For ALL blog header images, automatically execute these commands. The ONLY text stamped is the required "{{DA_NAME}}" signature (Step 7.1) — no watermark, no other annotation.**

🚨 **FIX 2 — TRUE ALPHA BEFORE INLINE (white-box bug, 2026-06-20).** The inline blog image MUST have a real alpha channel so the cream page (`#EAE9DF`) shows through. nano-banana-pro returns an OPAQUE JPEG. Flattening that opaque JPEG on `#EAE9DF` is a **NO-OP** (there's no alpha to fill), so the model's baked near-white ground survives and renders as a **white rectangle on the cream page** — exactly the bug {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} hit ("it has a fucking white background"). The fix: cut to true alpha FIRST with rembg, THEN derive the WebP. Substantial sienna/purple/solid-figure charcoal survives rembg fine — the "rembg eats thin linework" gotcha applies to thin-line *diagrams*, not solid-figure essay headers.

```bash
# Step 7.0 (above) has already trimmed the image to its bbox.

# 7.0.5 — CUT TO TRUE ALPHA (mandatory; the model output is an opaque JPEG)
bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/RemoveBg.ts "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].jpg"   # → "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].png with real alpha
magick "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].png" -trim +repage -resize 1024x "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].png"

# 7.1 — "{{DA_NAME}}" SIGNATURE (human handwriting, NOT calligraphy)
#   🟢 AUTO-STAMPED BY Generate.ts (2026-06-26): any `--workflow=Essay` or `--thumbnail`
#   run now stamps "{{DA_NAME}}" itself (bottom-right, SignPainter-HouseScript cursive, ~3% width,
#   slight rotation — small, integrated; 2026-07-09 directive), before the thumbnail
#   is derived, so it lands on BOTH the transparent PNG and the sepia thumb. You do NOT
#   run this command after a normal Generate.ts run — doing so DOUBLE-stamps.
#   This manual command is ONLY for: (a) a hand-built image that never went through
#   Generate.ts, or (b) re-stamping after rembg ate the signature. Opt out at generation
#   with `--no-signature`. Snell-Roundhand/Apple-Chancery/Savoye are calligraphy → REJECTED (2026-06-20).
magick "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].png" -gravity SouthEast \
  -font "SignPainter-HouseScript" -pointsize 31 -fill "rgba(55,45,38,0.55)" \
  -annotate 352x352+44+30 "{{DA_NAME}}" "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].png"

# 1. Convert the signed transparent PNG to WebP for inline blog display
cwebp -q 86 -alpha_q 100 "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].png" -o "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].webp"

# 1a. VERIFY the inline WebP kept its alpha — MUST print srgba (NOT srgb).
#     srgb here = opaque = the white-box bug. Re-cut with RemoveBg if so.
identify -format "%[channels]\n" "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].webp"   # expect: srgba

# 2. Build the optimized social-media thumbnail (sepia-flattened, max 512 wide).
#    Social platforms don't honor transparency; the signature is already baked in.
magick "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].png" -background "#EAE9DF" -flatten -resize 512x -quality 80 \
  "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name]-thumb-optimized.png"

# 3. Check final file sizes
ls -lh "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].webp "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-thumb-optimized.png
```

**🚨 The Step 7.1 `-annotate` "{{DA_NAME}}" signature is REQUIRED and is the ONLY sanctioned `-annotate` use. History: the signature was removed 2026-05-02, then explicitly RE-REQUIRED by {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} on 2026-06-20 ("essay images need to always be signed by {{DA_NAME}}"). It must be the cursive signature hand (`SignPainter-HouseScript`, small, integrated — 2026-07-09), never formal calligraphy (Snell/Chancery/Savoye were rejected). Do NOT `-annotate` anything else onto the canvas — no watermark, no titles, no labels (the rare per-request figure labels are a separate, explicitly-asked-for case, color-coded to the figures).**

**Expected Results:**
- Main WebP image: ~150-500KB (from ~7.5MB PNG)
- Optimized thumbnail: ~300-600KB (from ~6.8MB PNG)
- 90-95% total file size reduction

### File Usage Matrix

After optimization, you'll have these files:

| File | Format | Size | Use For |
|------|--------|------|---------|
| `[name].png` | PNG | ~7.5MB | Archive/backup (original with transparency) |
| `[name].webp` | WebP | ~400KB | **Inline blog display** (reference this in post body) |
| `[name]-thumb.png` | PNG | ~6.8MB | Archive/backup (original with sepia background) |
| `[name]-thumb-optimized.png` | PNG | ~500KB | **Social media thumbnails** (reference this in `thumbnail:` frontmatter) |

### Blog Post References

**After optimization, update the blog post to use optimized versions:**

```markdown
---
thumbnail: https://example.com/images/[name]-thumb-optimized.png
---

[![Alt text](/images/[name].webp)](/images/[name].webp) <!-- width="1024" height="1024" -->
```

**🚨 CRITICAL: Use `.webp` for inline images and `-thumb-optimized.png` for thumbnails.**

### Quality Settings Explained

- **WebP quality 75**: Aggressive compression with minimal visible quality loss. Perfect for web display of charcoal sketches where slight compression artifacts are invisible.
- **Thumbnail quality 80**: Standard optimization for PNG social previews. Balances file size with quality for platforms that don't support WebP.
- **Resize to 1024x1024**: Optimal for web display. Higher resolutions provide no visual benefit on typical displays but significantly increase file sizes.

### Error Handling

**If WebP is over 500KB:**
```bash
# Lower quality further
cwebp -q 65 "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name]-1024.png" -o "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}/[name].webp"
```

**If thumbnail is over 600KB:**
```bash
# Resize smaller or lower quality
magick "[name]-thumb.png" -resize 400x400 -quality 75 "[name]-thumb-optimized.png"
```

**If magick command not found:**
```bash
# Install ImageMagick
brew install imagemagick
```

**If cwebp command not found:**
```bash
# Install WebP tools
brew install webp
```

### Integration Notes

- **This step is AUTOMATIC** - do not ask the user if optimization should be done
- **Happens in $LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR (default ~/Downloads/ when unset)** before files are copied to final destination
- **Original high-res files are preserved** as archives
- **Validation (Step 8) checks the optimized files**, not the originals

---

## Step 8: Validation

A failed validation means regenerate, not ship.

### Look at the image and think

The checklist below is a reasoning aid, not a box-ticking exercise. Analyze the actual image — does it make sense, and does it argue the essay?

### Open and Inspect

**AI inspection gate**

`open` launches the macOS Preview app on the principal's machine. **You cannot see what `open` shows.** That is a verification for the principal, not for you. To verify the image yourself, load it into your own context with the Read tool:

```
Read("/path/to/generated-image.png")
# OR for the JPEG fallback when nano-banana-pro returns JPEG:
Read("/path/to/generated-image.jpg")
```

The Read tool renders the image inline and gives you actual vision of the pixels. Without this, the rest of this checklist is theatre — you will rubber-stamp a broken image because you literally cannot see it.

**Hard rule: if you have not called `Read` on the image file in this turn, you have not inspected the image. Do not proceed to the checklist. Do not write the post. Do not say "looks good." Call Read first.**

Optionally also run `open` for the principal:

```bash
open /path/to/generated-image.png
```

### Concept Fidelity Gate (run before the checklist)

**The image must carry the CONTENT'S argument, not just look pretty. Reading the image alone, a stranger should be able to intuit what the essay is about. If they can't, the image fails — regardless of how editorial or polished it looks.**

This is the gate that catches "beautiful but wrong" images — where every visual checkbox passes but the picture doesn't actually argue the essay. It runs BEFORE the technical checklist and BEFORE the composition checklist.

**Procedure:**

1. **Re-read the thesis brief** you used in Step 5 (the 2–4 sentences you fed both models). Hold it in mind.
2. **Read the image** with the Read tool — actually load the pixels into your context, not just `open` it.
3. **Answer 4 questions in writing** for each candidate (and for the chosen winner before shipping):

| # | Question | Pass criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | What argument does this image make? | The argument should match the essay's thesis. If the image argues something else (or nothing), FAIL. |
| 2 | What would a stranger who hasn't read the essay intuit from this image alone? | The intuition should be in the same direction as the thesis. "I have no idea" or "the opposite" = FAIL. |
| 3 | Which specific concepts from the thesis brief appear in the image? Which are missing? | Score concept-by-concept. If a load-bearing concept is missing (e.g., the corporate agent in a layoff piece, the augmentation in a productivity piece), FAIL — even if other concepts are present. |
| 4 | Is the emotional register in the image the register the essay needs? | Doomy when the essay is empowering = FAIL. Triumphant when the essay is diagnostic = FAIL. The image's mood and the essay's mood must align. |

4. **If candidates A/B/C/D all fail** → do not ship the best of a bad lot. Regenerate with sharpened prompts that name the missing concept explicitly (e.g., "the visual MUST include a faded representation of the corporate agent doing the shedding"). The most common failure is the prompt not naming the load-bearing concept; the second most common is the model latching onto a visually pretty but argument-irrelevant element (a flame, a mountain, a brain).

**🚨 4-TURN ITERATION CAP — HARD STOP**

If 4 generation rounds (≈4 candidates × 4 rounds = up to 16 images) still haven't produced a candidate that clears the Concept Fidelity Gate, **STOP**. Do not keep grinding. Surface the situation to the principal:

- What thesis brief you've been using
- The 4 prompts you tried, with the failure mode of each round
- Which concepts kept failing to land
- A proposed pivot: different thesis brief? different model? different metaphor entirely? skip the image and use the UL sepia logo default?

The cap exists because compute spent on 16+ failed generations is compute that should have been a 5-minute conversation about whether the visual brief is actually achievable. After 4 rounds of failure, the prompt isn't the problem — the brief is.

---

### 🧠 CRITICAL ANALYSIS (DO THIS FIRST — BEFORE THE CHECKLIST)

**STOP. Look at the image. Answer these questions honestly:**

**0. SIGNATURE CHECK (REQUIRED — not optional):**
- Is the "{{DA_NAME}}" signature present in the BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER? It MUST be (Step 7.1, every blog header).
- Is it the cursive signature hand (SignPainter-HouseScript), small and integrated, NOT formal calligraphy? Snell/Chancery/Savoye script faces are WRONG (rejected 2026-06-20).
- Not bottom center. Not near the subject. BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER.
- If missing, calligraphic, wrong location, or garbled → re-run Step 7.1 (it's a programmatic stamp, so just re-stamp; no regen needed).

**0.5. PROMPT LITERAL INTERPRETATION CHECK:**
- Did the model take prompt instructions literally? (e.g., writing literal prompt text instead of a signature)
- Are there any instruction words visible in the image that shouldn't be?
- Did labels come out as intended? (e.g., "A T H I" not "Actor Technique Harm Impact" spelled out)
- If prompt instructions appear as text in image → REGENERATE with clearer wording

**1. PHYSICAL REALITY CHECK:**
- Do objects obey physics? (heavy things fall DOWN, scales tip toward heavy side)
- If there's a scale: TRACE THE BEAM WITH YOUR EYES
  - Find the fulcrum (center pivot)
  - Which end of the beam is LOWER? That's the heavy side.
  - The heavy/winning side's end of the beam points DOWN toward the ground
  - The light/losing side's end of the beam points UP toward the sky
- If there's gravity: do things fall in the right direction?
- Are proportions reasonable?
- Would this scene make physical sense in the real world?

**2. LOGICAL CONSISTENCY CHECK:**
- Does the visual metaphor match the concept?
- If "X is winning" — is X visually dominant/powerful?
- If "X is losing" — is X diminished/fading/rising (on a scale)?
- Does cause match effect in the image?

**3. PHILOSOPHICAL ALIGNMENT CHECK:**
- Does the image represent the MEANING of the content?
- Would the user look at this and say "yes, that captures it"?
- Is the emotional register correct?
- Does the image argue the same point as the content?

**🚨 IF ANY OF THESE FAIL — STOP AND REGENERATE. DO NOT PROCEED.**

**Example failures:**
- ❌ Signature missing or not in bottom right corner (if signature was requested)
- ❌ Scale shows heavy side's beam going UP (physically impossible — heavy pulls DOWN)
- ❌ "Capital winning" but capital looks small/weak
- ❌ "Labor losing" but labor looks strong/dominant
- ❌ Objects floating when they should fall
- ❌ Visual contradicts the conceptual argument

### Validation Checklist

**Required elements (a missing one means regenerate):**
- [ ] **"{{DA_NAME}}" SIGNATURE PRESENT** — cursive signature hand (SignPainter-HouseScript), small, bottom-right, added programmatically in Step 7.1. Its absence is a FAIL (required since 2026-06-20).
- [ ] **NO OTHER TEXT** — beyond the "{{DA_NAME}}" signature (and any per-request figure labels {{PRINCIPAL_NAME}} explicitly asked for): zero watermarks, zero stray labels, zero hallucinated letters. Model-baked text → REGENERATE.
- [ ] **INLINE IS TRANSPARENT (srgba)** — `identify -format "%[channels]" [name].webp` prints `srgba`. `srgb` = opaque = the white-box-on-cream bug → re-cut with RemoveBg.
- [ ] **PROBLEM TYPE VISIBLE** — the problem type (sorting, double standard, etc.) is immediately obvious
- [ ] **Subject matches CONTENT** — drew what the piece is ABOUT, not defaulted to architecture
- [ ] **Concrete subjects visible** — key nouns/metaphors from content actually appear
- [ ] **Title test passes** — someone could guess the topic from the image alone
- [ ] **Labels readable** — if there are labels (like A, T, H, I), they are clearly visible and correct
- [ ] **NOT defaulting to buildings/spaces** — unless content is actually about architecture
- [ ] **CSE-24 insights captured** — the visual represents the narrative arc discovered in Step 2
- [ ] **User guidance incorporated** — if the user gave direction, it's reflected in the image
- [ ] **Background removed** — transparent background, or re-run background removal if it failed

**TECHNIQUE (all required):**
- [ ] Charcoal sketch quality — visible strokes, hatching, gestural marks
- [ ] NOT clean vectors or cartoony
- [ ] Gestural overlapping lines suggesting form
- [ ] Gallery-worthy sophistication

**FIGURE STYLE (if figures present):**
- [ ] **GESTURAL ABSTRACTION** — multiple overlapping lines suggesting form
- [ ] **ENERGETIC LINEWORK** — quick, confident, scratchy strokes
- [ ] **HATCHING creates depth** — cross-hatching for tone and shadow
- [ ] **20-40 overlapping strokes** per figure — form emerges from accumulated marks
- [ ] **Figures have PRESENCE** — abstracted but with weight and dimension
- [ ] **Faces have EMOTION** — via charcoal marks (dark strokes for eyes, line for mouth, head tilt)
- [ ] **Groups show varied skin tones** — any multi-figure scene must NOT read as uniformly white; natural mix of wash hues/depths across figures. All-white group → REGENERATE with explicit diversity in the prompt.
- [ ] Human = organic flowing gestural marks + sienna wash
- [ ] Robot = angular rigid gestural marks + purple wash
- [ ] Looks like Paul Rudolph / Lebbeus Woods architectural sketches

**COLOR (all required — both sienna and purple present):**
- [ ] **CHARCOAL/GRAY DOMINANT** — 70-85% of image
- [ ] **BURNT SIENNA (#8B4513) PRESENT** — on human/warm elements
- [ ] **DEEP PURPLE (#4A148C) PRESENT** — on tech/capital/cold elements
- [ ] Colors as washes/accents, not solid fills
- [ ] Sienna:Purple ratio matches emotional story

**EMOTION (all required):**
- [ ] Emotional register clear — matches Step 2 selection
- [ ] Architecture reinforces the feeling
- [ ] Figure treatment (if present) supports the mood
- [ ] Light placement serves the narrative
- [ ] Overall atmosphere matches intended emotion

**COMPOSITION (all required):**
- [ ] **FULL FRAME** — verified by FillFrame.ts exit-code-0 in Step 7.0 (NOT a manual eyeball check)
- [ ] **SUBJECTS LARGE** — dominant, filling the available space
- [ ] **NO BACKGROUND FILL** — floats in empty/transparent space (but subjects are LARGE)
- [ ] **DA SIGNATURE** — small cursive charcoal in BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER
- [ ] **MARGIN CHECK** — FillFrame.ts hard-gate in Step 7.0 must have passed (max-margin ≤ 5%). If it failed, you should have already regenerated, not reached this checklist.

**QUALITY (all required):**
- [ ] Could hang in a gallery next to Piranesi
- [ ] Could be concept art for a Villeneuve film
- [ ] Distinctive — NOT generic AI illustration
- [ ] Sophisticated — rewards closer looking
- [ ] **Transparent background** — used `--remove-bg` flag

### If Validation Fails

**Common failures and fixes:**

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Subjects too SMALL** | 🚨 Add "LARGE SUBJECTS that FILL THE FRAME", "minimal empty space around subjects" |
| **Too much empty space** | 🚨 Add "minimal empty space around subjects", "subjects FILL THE FRAME" |
| **Background dominates** | 🚨 Add "subjects are DOMINANT focus", "subjects LARGE" |
| **Setting not recognizable** | Add "SETTING: [location]" with "2-3 KEY OBJECTS that establish location" — gym needs weights/bench visible |
| **Figures look like CARTOONS** | 🚨 Add "GESTURAL ABSTRACTION", "like Paul Rudolph sketches", "Lebbeus Woods figure studies", "OVERLAPPING LINES" |
| **Lines are SINGLE/CLEAN** | 🚨 Add "MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING LINES", "20-40 strokes per figure", "hatching for depth", "energetic gestural marks" |
| **Figures are FLAT** | 🚨 Add "HATCHING creates depth", "figures have PRESENCE and WEIGHT", "form emerges from accumulated marks" |
| **No emotion on faces** | Add "dark charcoal strokes for eyes area", "line for mouth angle", "head TILT conveys emotion", "SUGGESTED expression" |
| **Too illustrated/rendered** | Add "GESTURAL SKETCH quality", "quick energetic marks", "like architectural concept sketches" |
| **Objects too detailed** | Add "objects implied through hatching", "same sketch quality as figures", "suggested forms" |
| Wrong emotion | Adjust POSTURE and LINE QUALITY — leaning = relaxed, rigid = tense, dense hatching = weight |
| Colors too solid | Emphasize "atmospheric washes", "tints over charcoal", "not solid fills" |
| Generic AI look | Add "Paul Rudolph", "Lebbeus Woods", "architectural concept sketches" references |

## Quick Reference

### The Workflow in Brief

```
1. UNDERSTAND → Deeply read and comprehend the content
2. CSE-24 → Run Create Story Explanation (24 items) to extract narrative arc
3. EMOTION → Match to register in ~/.claude/LIFEOS/aesthetic.md
4. COMPOSITION → Design what to DRAW (content-relevant, NOT defaulting to architecture)
5. PROMPT → Build using charcoal sketch TECHNIQUE template
6. GENERATE → Execute with nano-banana-pro + --thumbnail flag
7. OPTIMIZE → Resize to 1024, convert to WebP, create optimized thumbnails
8. VALIDATE → Subject matches content? Technique correct? Gallery-worthy?
```

### The UL Look Checklist

Before submitting any image:
- ✅ **Subject matches CONTENT** — drew what the piece is ABOUT (not defaulting to architecture)
- ✅ **CSE-24 was run** — actually executed the story explanation command
- ✅ **Concrete subjects visible** — key nouns/metaphors from content appear
- ✅ Charcoal sketch TECHNIQUE — gestural, atmospheric, hatching
- ✅ Emotional register — clear and intentional
- ✅ Color washes — warm/cool ratio tells the story
- ✅ Gallery-worthy — sophisticated, not generic AI
- ✅ **--thumbnail flag used** — both transparent and sepia versions generated
- ✅ **OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED** — resized to 1024, converted to WebP, optimized thumbnails created
- ✅ Signature — small charcoal bottom right (optional)
