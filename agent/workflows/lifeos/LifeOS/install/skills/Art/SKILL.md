# Art Skill

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/Art/`

If this directory exists, load and apply:
- `PREFERENCES.md` - Aesthetic preferences, default model, output location
- `CharacterSpecs.md` - Character design specifications
- `SceneConstruction.md` - Scene composition guidelines

These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the Art skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **Art** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

## What It Does

Generates static visual content across 20+ formats — blog headers, technical and architecture diagrams, frameworks, taxonomies, timelines, comparisons, stat cards, comics, icons, wallpapers, D3 charts, Mermaid diagrams — using Flux, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro), and GPT-Image-2. Every request routes through a named workflow that encodes the technique and palette, output stages to $LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR (default ~/Downloads/ when unset) for review first, and blog headers ship both a transparent inline version and an opaque social thumbnail.

## The Problem

The bare image model produces inconsistent, off-style output when handed a freeform prompt — one session shipped 12 rejected diagrams because the prompt skipped the workflow that holds the composition rules. Different formats need different models (text-heavy cards want GPT-Image-2; editorial headers want Nano Banana Pro), different size formats, and different transparency handling. Without a fixed routing-and-staging discipline, you get wrong sizes, opaque headers that bleed over the page background, and images pushed straight to a repo before anyone looked at them. This skill makes the workflow, the model choice, and the Downloads-first review mandatory in code, not just in markdown.

## How It Works

A complete visual content system for illustrations, diagrams, and other static visuals. Each request picks a matching workflow file first, follows its prompt template, then calls `Generate.ts` with `--workflow=<name>` plus model/size/output flags. Two layers enforce that the workflow was followed (`Generate.ts` itself and the `ArtWorkflowGuard.hook.ts` PreToolUse hook), output always lands in $LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR (default ~/Downloads/ when unset) for preview, and blog headers run with `--thumbnail` to produce both the transparent PNG and the sepia-backed social thumbnail.

## 🛑 STRUCTURAL ENFORCEMENT — `--workflow=<name>` IS REQUIRED

**This rule used to be markdown-only and was silently ignored, producing 12 rejected diagrams in one session (incident 2026-04-30, see ISA `MEMORY/WORK/20260430-180000_art-skill-freeform-enforcement`). It now lives in code.**

Two layers enforce it:

1. **`Generate.ts` itself** refuses to run unless you pass `--workflow=<name>` (or the explicit `--freeform-confirmed` opt-out). It exits non-zero with the workflow lookup table.
2. **`ArtWorkflowGuard.hook.ts`** (PreToolUse Bash) blocks any Bash command containing `Art/Tools/Generate.ts` without `--workflow=` or `--freeform-confirmed`, with exit code 2 and the same lookup table.

**The flow that works:** read the matching workflow file → follow its prompt template → invoke `Generate.ts` with `--workflow=<that-workflow-name>` plus your model/prompt/size flags. The `--workflow=<name>` flag is your explicit assertion "I read the workflow and followed it."

**The flow that's blocked:** composing a freeform prompt and shipping it directly to `Generate.ts`. Both layers above will refuse.

### Most Common Failure Mode (don't repeat it)

Reading the workflow's caps-warning, mentally noting "do the workflow," then composing a Bash command with your own prompt anyway because it feels faster. **Stop.** The workflow templates encode the technique, palette, composition rules, and validation gate the bare model fails to honor. Skipping them produced — verbatim — "absolute fucking ass" diagrams. Read the workflow file FIRST. Compose the prompt FROM the template. Pass `--workflow=<name>` so the gate can see you did it.

### Workflow → command (copy-paste)

```bash
bun ~/.claude/skills/Art/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --workflow=<WorkflowName> \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "..." \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --output "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/<filename>.png
```

`<WorkflowName>` MUST match a file under `Workflows/` (without `.md`):

**Routing rules — pick a workflow FIRST, before writing any prompt:**

| Request shape | Required workflow |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Blog header / editorial essay illustration | **`Workflows/Essay.md`** — Steps 1–8 in order, no skipping |
| Mermaid diagram | `Workflows/Mermaid.md` |
| Technical / architecture diagram | `Workflows/TechnicalDiagrams.md` |
| Framework / 2x2 / matrix | `Workflows/Frameworks.md` |
| D3 dashboard / chart | `Workflows/D3Dashboards.md` |
| Taxonomy / hierarchy | `Workflows/Taxonomies.md` |
| Timeline | `Workflows/Timelines.md` |
| Comparison | `Workflows/Comparisons.md` |
| Stat card | `Workflows/Stats.md` |
| Aphorism / quote card | `Workflows/Aphorisms.md` |
| Comic panel | `Workflows/Comics.md` |
| Locked house-style YouTube / channel thumbnail | **Use a dedicated locked-house-style thumbnail skill** — it owns the locked style and orchestrates the Art tools below. Don't drive these workflows directly for channel thumbnails. |
| YouTube thumbnail (generic mechanism, orchestrated by the thumbnail skill) | **`Workflows/StyleMatchedThumbnail.md`** — deterministic text + real-photo face |
| YouTube thumbnail (legacy / validation) | `Workflows/AdHocYouTubeThumbnail.md` or `Workflows/YouTubeThumbnailChecklist.md` |
| LifeOS pack icon | `Workflows/CreateLifeosPackIcon.md` |
| brand-logo wallpaper | `Workflows/LogoWallpaper.md` |
| Recipe card | `Workflows/RecipeCards.md` |
| Map / conceptual map | `Workflows/Maps.md` |
| Annotated screenshot | `Workflows/AnnotatedScreenshots.md` |
| Background removal only | `Workflows/RemoveBackground.md` |
| Embossed logo wallpaper | `Workflows/EmbossedLogoWallpaper.md` |
| Generic visualization (none of the above fit) | `Workflows/Visualize.md` |

**The ONLY exception:** the user explicitly says "freeform" / "skip the workflow" / "just run Generate.ts directly with this prompt: ...". In that case, pass `--freeform-confirmed` to `Generate.ts` (which logs the explicit opt-out to stderr for audit). Without that explicit instruction from the user, ALWAYS pick the matching workflow and pass `--workflow=<name>` — both `Generate.ts` and `ArtWorkflowGuard.hook.ts` will refuse the call otherwise.

If no workflow matches the request, **stop and surface to the user** before generating — propose either (a) the closest existing workflow, (b) using `Visualize.md` as the generic catch-all, or (c) creating a new workflow first via the `CreateSkill` skill. Do not improvise.

## 🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY: Output to Downloads First 🚨🚨🚨

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  ALL GENERATED IMAGES GO TO $LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR (default ~/Downloads/ when unset) FIRST                   ⚠️
⚠️  NEVER output directly to project directories                    ⚠️
⚠️  User MUST preview in Finder/Preview before use                  ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**This applies to ALL workflows in this skill.**

## 🚨🚨🚨 MANDATORY: Transparency Rules for Blog Headers 🚨🚨🚨

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  INLINE (body) image → TRANSPARENT (PNG with alpha)           ⚠️
⚠️  SOCIAL THUMBNAIL (frontmatter) → SEPIA #EAE9DF (opaque)       ⚠️
⚠️  EVERY blog header MUST use --thumbnail (produces both)        ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

The blog page background is sepia #EAE9DF. Inline images MUST be transparent PNG so they composite cleanly over the page. Social platforms (X, LinkedIn, RSS readers) do NOT honor transparency — they show white/black bleed-through — so the `thumbnail:` frontmatter MUST point to the sepia-backed version.

**Enforcement when calling `Generate.ts`:**
- `--thumbnail` is the ONLY correct flag for blog headers — it implicitly enables `--remove-bg` and produces BOTH `output.png` (transparent) AND `output-thumb.png` (#EAE9DF background).
- Background removal runs locally via `rembg` (no external API). If the model returns JPEG (Nano Banana Pro often does), `Generate.ts` automatically renames the output from `.jpg` → `.png` after rembg processing so the final transparent file is a real PNG with a real alpha channel. If you ever see a `.jpg` labeled "transparent", that is NOT transparent.
- If `rembg` isn't installed at `~/.local/bin/rembg`, the tool fails loudly with install instructions rather than silently producing an opaque image. Install: `pipx install rembg` (or set `REMBG_BIN` env var to override the path).

**Verification step before declaring an image done (REQUIRED):**
1. `file "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name].png` → must report `PNG image data, ... RGBA` (8-bit/color RGBA). If it says `JPEG` or `8-bit colormap` without alpha, transparency failed.
2. `file "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[name]-thumb.png` → must report `PNG image data`. The thumb is intentionally opaque with sepia background.
3. Only after both pass: copy to the project directory and wire into the post.

**Wiring into the blog post:**
- Body inline: `[![Alt](/images/blog/[slug]/header.webp)](/images/blog/[slug]/header.webp)` — use the transparent WebP converted from the `.png`.
- Frontmatter: `thumbnail: https://example.com/images/blog/[slug]/header-thumb.png` — always the `-thumb.png` (opaque sepia).

Never reuse the opaque thumbnail for the inline slot. Never reuse the transparent file for the social thumbnail. These are two distinct outputs from one `--thumbnail` run.

**Sanctioned exception (this section is the canonical home; the blog-authoring skill defers here):** transparent inline is the DEFAULT for every blog header. The one exception is thin-linework/charcoal pieces where rembg strips the artwork itself (see Gotchas) — those may ship an opaque sepia `#EAE9DF` inline image, which composites seamlessly on the matching page background. Opaque inline is a documented fallback for that failure mode, never a second default.

## Core Aesthetic

**Default:** Production-quality concept art style appropriate for editorial and technical content.

**User customization** defines specific aesthetic preferences including:
- Visual style and influences
- Line treatment and rendering approach
- Color palette and wash technique
- Character design specifications
- Scene composition rules

**Load from:** `~/.claude/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/Art/PREFERENCES.md`

---

## Reference Images

**User customization** may include reference images for consistent style.

Check `~/.claude/LIFEOS/USER/CUSTOMIZATIONS/SKILLS/Art/PREFERENCES.md` for:
- Reference image locations
- Style examples by use case
- Character and scene reference guidance

**Usage:** Before generating images, load relevant user-provided references to match their preferred style.

---

## Image Generation

**Default model:** Check user customization at `SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Art/PREFERENCES.md`
**Fallback:** nano-banana-pro (Gemini 3 Pro)

### Model-Specific Size Requirements

Each model accepts different `--size` formats. Using the wrong format causes validation errors.

| Model | `--size` format | Valid values | Default |
|-------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| `flux` | Aspect ratio | `1:1`, `16:9`, `3:2`, `2:3`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `9:16`, `21:9` | `16:9` |
| `nano-banana` | Aspect ratio | `1:1`, `16:9`, `3:2`, `2:3`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `4:5`, `5:4`, `9:16`, `21:9` | `16:9` |
| `nano-banana-pro` | Resolution tier | `1K`, `2K`, `4K` (also accepts `--aspect-ratio` separately) | `2K` |

**OpenAI image models are REMOVED (2026-07-30, principal's direction).** `gpt-image-1`, `gpt-image-2`, and the dual-provider `compare` mode are gone from `Generate.ts` — passing any of them exits with an error pointing at `nano-banana-pro`. Do not reintroduce an OpenAI image path, and do not add a different vendor as a substitute; adding a new vendor to any lane is an identity/doctrine-class decision requiring the principal's explicit approval.

### Model Selection — when to pick which

Three models are wired into `Generate.ts`, and `nano-banana-pro` is the DEFAULT for everything. PREFERENCES.md (if present) pins the user's default:

| Job | Model | Why |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Everything by default — editorial illustration, blog headers, text-heavy stat cards, frameworks, taxonomies, timelines, aphorism cards | `nano-banana-pro` | Best composition fidelity for the user's editorial aesthetic, and strong enough on labels and numbers to carry the text-heavy workflows too. |
| Stylistic variety / non-photoreal / crisper technical linework | `flux` | Different aesthetic register. |
| Faster iteration once the composition is settled | `nano-banana` | Quicker, slightly lower fidelity. |

**Note:** `nano-banana-pro` uses `--size` for resolution quality and a separate `--aspect-ratio` flag for aspect ratio (defaults to `16:9`).

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Always Output to Downloads First

**ALL generated images MUST go to `$LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR` (default `~/Downloads/` when unset) first for preview and selection.**

Never output directly to a project's `public/images/` directory. User needs to review images in Preview before they're used.

**Workflow:**
1. Generate to `"${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/[descriptive-name].png`
2. User reviews in Preview
3. If approved, THEN copy to final destination (e.g., `cms/public/images/`)
4. Create WebP and thumbnail versions at final destination

```bash
# CORRECT - Output to Downloads for preview
bun run ${LIFEOS_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "[PROMPT]" \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 1:1 \
  --thumbnail \
  --output "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/blog-header-concept.png

# After approval, copy to final location (substitute your blog/site path)
cp "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/blog-header-concept.png ~/your-site/public/images/
cp "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/blog-header-concept-thumb.png ~/your-site/public/images/
```

### Multiple Reference Images (Character/Style Consistency)

For improved character or style consistency, use multiple `--reference-image` flags:

```bash
# Multiple reference images for better likeness
bun run ${LIFEOS_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/Generate.ts \
  --model nano-banana-pro \
  --prompt "Person from references at a party..." \
  --reference-image face1.jpg \
  --reference-image face2.jpg \
  --reference-image face3.jpg \
  --size 2K \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --output "${LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR:-$HOME/Downloads}"/character-scene.png
```

**API Limits (Gemini):**
- Up to 5 human reference images
- Up to 6 object reference images
- Maximum 14 total reference images per request

**API keys in:** `${LIFEOS_DIR}/.env`

## Examples

**Example 1: Blog header image**
```
User: "create a header for my AI agents post"
→ Invokes ESSAY workflow
→ Generates charcoal sketch prompt
→ Creates image with architectural aesthetic
→ Saves to $LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR (default ~/Downloads/ when unset) for preview
→ After approval, copies to public/images/
```

**Example 2: Technical architecture diagram**
```
User: "make a diagram showing the SPQA pattern"
→ Invokes TECHNICALDIAGRAMS workflow
→ Creates structured architecture visual
→ Outputs PNG with consistent styling
```

**Example 3: Comparison visualization**
```
User: "visualize humans vs AI decision-making"
→ Invokes COMPARISONS workflow
→ Creates side-by-side visual
→ Charcoal sketch with labeled elements
```

**Example 4: LifeOS pack icon**
```
User: "create icon for the skill system pack"
→ Invokes CREATEPAIPACKICON workflow
→ Reads workflow from Workflows/CreateLifeosPackIcon.md
→ Generates 1K image with --remove-bg for transparency
→ Resizes to 256x256 RGBA PNG
→ Outputs to $LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR (default ~/Downloads/ when unset) for preview
→ After approval, copies to ${PROJECTS_DIR}/LIFEOS/Packs/icons/
```

## Gotchas

- **Always output to $LIFEOS_DOWNLOADS_DIR (default ~/Downloads/ when unset) first — NEVER directly to project directories.** User must preview before use. Multiple past failures from pushing wrong images directly to repos.
- **Verify image dimensions match target use case before claiming done.** Social media previews, blog headers, and thumbnails have different size requirements. A header that works on the blog may break OG/social previews.
- **nano-banana-pro uses `--size` for resolution (1K/2K/4K) and SEPARATE `--aspect-ratio` flag.** Don't pass aspect ratio values to `--size`.
- **Reference images: max 5 human, 6 object, 14 total per request** (Gemini API limit).
- **After generating, use Read tool to visually confirm the image before reporting success.** "Generated successfully" means nothing if you haven't looked at it.
- **When asked to use a specific image URL or file, use EXACTLY that asset.** Don't substitute similar images. Past rating-1 failures from using wrong image assets.
- **`--remove-bg` may produce black backgrounds instead of transparency.** Always verify transparent PNG output visually before deploying.
- **`--remove-bg` is unsafe for thin-linework technical diagrams.** rembg classifies thin black ink on a light field as "background" and strips it, leaving a near-empty ghost. Documented 2026-05-11 on the free-will flowchart. Mitigations: (a) prompt for *thick* saturated linework first so rembg has a strong signal, or (b) skip `--remove-bg` entirely when the destination background matches the image's background (blog page is sepia #EAE9DF — opaque sepia diagram on sepia page composites with zero visible seam, no alpha needed).
- **Logo fidelity breaks in 3D/perspective scenes even with a reference image.** Documented 2026-06-11 on the UL wallpaper set: straight-on and macro scenes held the glyph topology in 7/7 rolls, but the isometric 3D scene closed the open mark into a loop and dropped its isolated dot. For any perspective/3D composition with a logo, add topology-locked negative language to the prompt ("do not close the shape into a loop", "do not omit the isolated dot", name every stroke and terminal) on top of `--reference-image`, and vision-verify the topology specifically.
- **nano-banana-pro "4K 16:9" is actually 5504×3072 (43:24, ~0.8% wider than 16:9), saved as .jpg even when `--output` says .png.** Disclose the native ratio when the spec says 16:9, and probe the real filename before Read/delivery.
- **White-box-on-cream bug (2026-06-20): flattening an OPAQUE jpeg on `#EAE9DF` is a no-op.** nano-banana-pro returns an opaque JPEG; `magick -background "#EAE9DF" -flatten` only fills *alpha*, so the model's baked near-white ground survives and paints a white rectangle on the cream blog page ("it has a fucking white background"). For inline blog headers, cut true alpha FIRST (`bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/RemoveBg.ts`), then derive the WebP, and verify `identify -format "%[channels]" inline.webp` == `srgba`. Opaque-sepia inline is valid ONLY on an image that already has alpha. See Essay.md Step 7.0.5.
- **Essay headers: run the Step 5A Best-Image Deliberation before prompting (2026-07-09 principal directive).** Subject-list prompts produce rejected flat tableaus; a composition reasoned deeply from the essay's specific argument — scene concepts compared, every element given a narrative role, connected structure — produces accepted images. The deliberation is the mandatory step; devices like cutaways are possible outcomes, not rules. See Essay.md Step 5A.
- **Interior-white ban (2026-07-09, "giant white space" incident):** prompt large flat surfaces (desks, panels, windows, paper) as "warm cream paper tone", never bright white or unstated — baked-white interiors survive rembg intact and render as giant white rectangles on the cream page. Inside-the-subject sibling of the 2026-06-20 white-box bug. Also trim white padding off any external screenshot before embedding (`magick -fuzz 4% -trim` + sepia border).
- **Reference-image edits: negative text loses to the reference (2026-07-09 studio-background session).** When nano-banana-pro keeps reproducing an unwanted object that exists in the reference photo (e.g. a second floor lamp), "do NOT add/duplicate" prompt language fails ~7/8 rolls — the model preserves what it sees over what you forbid. Fix: roll until ONE output has the corrected composition, then use THAT output as the new `--reference-image` for the remaining variations; compliance jumped to 7/7. Editing the reference beats describing the edit.
- **Groups of figures must show varied skin tones (2026-07-12 principal directive).** Image models default every person to white; any multi-figure scene (essay headers, comics, visualizations) gets explicit prompt language for a natural range of skin tones — in the charcoal style, varied wash hues and tonal depths across figures. Subtle and natural, not tokenized — but an all-white group is a validation failure. See Essay.md HUMAN FIGURES block + Step 8 checklist.
- **Essay/blog headers MUST be signed "{{DA_NAME}}" (2026-06-20 + 2026-07-09 principal directives) — cursive signature hand, small, integrated.** Programmatic stamp in Generate.ts/Essay.md Step 7.1 (`SignPainter-HouseScript`, ~3% of image width, semi-transparent charcoal, slight rotation, tucked into the composition's bottom-right); never prompt the signature into the model (it garbles). Formal calligraphy faces (Snell-Roundhand / Apple-Chancery / Savoye) remain rejected; oversized print-letter Bradley Hand was replaced 2026-07-09 ("more cursive looking and smaller, more part of the image").

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Art","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/LIFEOS/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
