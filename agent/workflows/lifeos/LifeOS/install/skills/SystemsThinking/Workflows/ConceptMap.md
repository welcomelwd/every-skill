# ConceptMap Workflow — SystemsThinking

## Purpose

Build a **concept map** — a visual network of entities and their labeled relationships — to understand a domain's structure. Unlike causal loop diagrams (which model *dynamics*), concept maps model *relationships* and *semantics*. Use them when you're trying to understand "what are the things, and how are they connected?"

Concept maps come from Joseph Novak's work on meaningful learning (Cornell, 1972). The key invariant: every link is a **labeled proposition**, not just an arrow.

## Invocation

- "Concept map"
- "Map the entities"
- "Relationship map"
- "Novak-style mapping"
- Early-stage domain exploration, onboarding docs, architecture overviews, knowledge capture

**Not for:** dynamic behavior (use CausalLoop), incident causation (use RootCauseAnalysis), hierarchical decomposition (use an outline or tree).

## The Structure

```
[CONCEPT A]  ──"contains"──▶  [CONCEPT B]
    │
    │"interacts with"
    ▼
[CONCEPT C]  ──"depends on"──▶  [CONCEPT D]
```

**Components:**
- **Concepts** — nodes, usually nouns or noun phrases, enclosed in boxes
- **Links** — labeled edges, describing the relationship between concepts
- **Propositions** — concept + link + concept reads as a short statement: "Concept A contains Concept B"
- **Cross-links** — links between concepts in different parts of the map, revealing non-obvious connections (these are often the most valuable insights)
- **Hierarchy** — most general concepts at top, specifics at bottom (not strictly required but helpful)

## Execution

A done map fills the output block below and answers one focus question. The probes and tests:

**Focus question.** Every map answers one specific question — without it the map is a disorganized bag of concepts. "How does authentication flow through our platform?" works; "What is authentication?" (too broad) and "Show me the auth architecture" (not a question) don't.

**Concepts.** 10-30 nouns or noun phrases at roughly the same abstraction level (don't mix "cloud computing" with "HTTP header"), each concrete enough to have relationships ("good architecture" is too vague). Re-noun any verbs — "Deployment," not "deploying."

**Hierarchy.** Arrange general (top) to specific (bottom); this gives the map spatial structure. No hierarchy emerging is a signal — either the concepts are all one level (flat map is fine) or you're missing organizing concepts to add.

**Labeled links.** Every link is a labeled proposition that reads as a valid statement concept-link-concept ("User session [uses] JWT token"). An unlabeled arrow is just "somehow related" — the label is the entire value. Common labels:

```
"contains", "has", "is a", "is part of"
"uses", "depends on", "requires"
"produces", "creates", "results in"
"triggers", "responds to", "listens for"
"reads from", "writes to"
"authenticates", "authorizes", "validates"
"owns", "manages", "monitors"
"extends", "overrides", "implements"
"precedes", "follows", "parallels"
```

**Cross-links.** Links between different regions of the map — the highest-value output. They reveal non-obvious dependencies and interactions invisible from the hierarchy (e.g. "database connection pool" [feeds back into] "request timeout policy" — pool exhaustion affects timeout behavior). A map with no cross-links usually missed the interesting relationships.

**Review.** Answer the focus question aloud walking the map; check every proposition reads as a grammatical statement, no concept is an orphan, and granularity is 10-30 concepts.

## Rendering

Concept maps benefit enormously from visual rendering. Use the Art skill:

```bash
Skill("Art", "Mermaid concept map with focus question [Q], concepts: [list], labeled links: [list], cross-links: [list]")
```

Mermaid or graphviz both work. Mermaid renders inline in most editors; graphviz produces higher-quality static images.

## Output

```
📊 CONCEPT MAP: [topic]

FOCUS QUESTION: [...]

CONCEPTS (general → specific):
- [C1], [C2], ..., [Cn]

HIERARCHY:
  [C1]
    ├─ [C2]
    │   └─ [C5]
    └─ [C3]
        └─ [C6]

PROPOSITIONS (concept → [link] → concept):
- [C1] → [contains] → [C2]
- [C2] → [uses] → [C5]
- ...

CROSS-LINKS:
- [C5] → [feeds back into] → [C3] — reveals non-obvious dependency
- [C6] → [validates through] → [C2] — hidden validation path

KEY INSIGHTS:
- [Insight from cross-link 1]
- [Insight from cross-link 2]
```

## Worked Example — LifeOS Algorithm Subsystems

```
FOCUS QUESTION: What are the subsystems of the LifeOS Algorithm, and how do they interact?

CONCEPTS (general → specific):
- Algorithm (root)
- Phases, ISC Quality System, ISA, Capabilities
- OBSERVE, THINK, PLAN, BUILD, EXECUTE, VERIFY, LEARN
- FeedbackMemoryConsult, Advisor, LiveProbe, ConflictSurfacing
- IterativeDepth, ApertureOscillation, FirstPrinciples, Council, RedTeam, Science, SystemsThinking, RootCauseAnalysis

PROPOSITIONS:
- Algorithm → [has phases] → {OBSERVE, THINK, ..., LEARN}
- Algorithm → [uses] → ISA
- Algorithm → [enforces] → ISC Quality System
- OBSERVE → [selects] → Capabilities
- Capabilities → [include thinking skills] → {IterativeDepth, FirstPrinciples, ..., SystemsThinking, RootCauseAnalysis}
- THINK → [invokes] → Thinking skills
- VERIFY → [enforces] → Verification Doctrine
- Verification Doctrine → [includes] → {LiveProbe, Advisor, ConflictSurfacing}
- PLAN → [begins with] → FeedbackMemoryConsult
- LEARN → [writes to] → Knowledge Archive

CROSS-LINKS:
- ISC Quality System → [gates exit of] → OBSERVE  (governance cross-link)
- Advisor → [re-invoked by] → ConflictSurfacing (recursion cross-link)
- LEARN → [informs future] → OBSERVE (next-session cross-link)

INSIGHTS:
- The Algorithm is not linear — OBSERVE and LEARN are connected across sessions via Knowledge Archive.
- The Verification Doctrine has an internal loop (ConflictSurfacing re-invokes Advisor), which is a first-order structural protection against motivated reasoning.
- Thinking capabilities are selected in OBSERVE but invoked in THINK — separation of concerns.
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Unlabeled arrows.** An unlabeled arrow is just "somehow related." The label is the entire value.
- **Too many concepts.** Over 30-50 and the map is unreadable. Split into sub-maps by region.
- **Mixed abstraction levels.** "System" and "semicolon" in the same map is confusing. Keep concepts roughly homogeneous in scale.
- **Missing cross-links.** The hierarchy is the scaffolding; cross-links are the insight. A map without cross-links usually missed the interesting relationships.
- **Trying to show causation.** If arrows mean "causes," you want a CausalLoop diagram, not a concept map.
- **Concepts that are verbs.** "Running," "processing," "deploying" are activities, not concepts. Re-noun them: "Deployment," "Processing step."

## When to Use vs. Other Diagrams

| Goal | Diagram |
|------|---------|
| Understand *what things are* and *how they relate* | **Concept Map** |
| Understand *how behavior is generated over time* | CausalLoop |
| Understand *why something happened* | RCA (Fishbone, 5 Whys) |
| Model *hierarchical decomposition* | Tree / outline |
| Model *sequential steps* | Flowchart |
| Model *state transitions* | State diagram |

## Integration

- Feeds **Iceberg** — Layer 3 (structure) often benefits from a concept map of the actors and relationships
- Feeds **CausalLoop** — concepts and relationships from the map inform variables and arrows
- Pairs with **Knowledge** skill — concept maps make excellent Knowledge Archive entries
- Rendered via **Art** skill — Mermaid, Graphviz, or d2
