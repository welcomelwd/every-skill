/**
 * InterviewScan — comprehensive completeness scanner across unified TELOS
 * sections + setup/identity files. Produces a prioritized gap report so
 * `/interview` can dynamically build the conversation around what's actually missing.
 *
 * Scans every relevant target, computes completeness, weights by leverage
 * (targets that unlock other context score higher), and outputs either a
 * human-readable gap report or a JSON plan the Interview skill consumes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun InterviewScan.ts                 Human-readable gap report (default)
 *   bun InterviewScan.ts --json          JSON for programmatic consumption
 *   bun InterviewScan.ts --next          Show single next priority target + prompts
 *   bun InterviewScan.ts --file <path>   Deep-scan single file
