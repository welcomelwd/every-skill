/**
 * MutationTier — four-tier autonomic-mutation boundary classifier.
 *
 * LifeOS autonomic memory subsystem, F8.
 *
 * Classifies any absolute path under ~/.claude/ into one of four tiers that
 * govern what the Memory Reviewer subprocess is allowed to do with it:
 *
 *   Tier A — fully autonomic. Reviewer Phase 1 may set-overwrite via MemoryWriter.
 *            (the two _MEMORY.md hot-layer files)
 *
 *   Tier B — logged-append only. Reviewer Phase 2 may append, writing a row to
 *            tier-b-writes.jsonl per write.
 *            (PROJECTS.md, CONTACTS.md, anything under MEMORY/KNOWLEDGE/)
 *
 *   Tier C — propose-only. Reviewer Phase 1 may queue an identity-doctrine
 *            proposal to be queued for principal review (loud) or applied silently
 *            (quiet) per the confidence threshold; never direct-Edit.
 *            (PRINCIPAL_IDENTITY, DA_IDENTITY, WRITINGSTYLE, DEFINITIONS,
 *            CANONICAL_CONTENT, RESUME)
 *
 *   Tier D — untouchable. Reviewer dispatcher rejects any Edit attempt.
 *            (default for everything not on a Tier A/B/C list)
 *
 * The classifier is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist (ISC-105): a new file added
 * to ~/.claude/ is by default unreachable to the reviewer. Tier classifications
 * are hard-coded in this file (ISC-106): there is no config-file override
 * path — changing a tier requires editing this code, reviewing, committing.
 *
 * CLI:
 *   bun MutationTier.ts classify <absolute-path>
 *   bun MutationTier.ts test                       (smoke test — exit 0 on pass)

/**
 * Classify an absolute path into one of four mutation tiers.
 *
 * The argument MUST be absolute (caller should `path.resolve()` first). Symlink
 * resolution is the caller's responsibility — this classifier matches on the
 * canonical absolute path string only, by design: it must be cheap, sync, and
 * untrickable by relative-path games.
 *
 * Returns 'D' (untouchable) for any path that is not explicitly on a higher
 * tier's allowlist. This default-deny posture is intentional: a brand-new file
 * added to ~/.claude/ is unreachable to the reviewer until a code change
 * explicitly raises its tier.
