 * 30-min bursts (Decision #4).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun InterviewIdealState.ts --next         Show next dimension to interview
 *   bun InterviewIdealState.ts --status       Progress report across all files
 *   bun InterviewIdealState.ts --dimension X  Show TBD markers for dimension X
 *   bun InterviewIdealState.ts --mark-done X  Mark dimension X complete
