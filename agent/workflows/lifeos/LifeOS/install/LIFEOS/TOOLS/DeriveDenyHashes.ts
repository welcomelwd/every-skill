/**
 * DeriveDenyHashes.ts — turn the principal's PRIVATE corpus into a SALTED-HASH
 * leak filter, so the guard can block private data appearing in shipping code
 * WITHOUT the filter ever containing that data in the clear.
 *
 *   bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/DeriveDenyHashes.ts            # regenerate DENY_HASHES.json
 *   bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/DeriveDenyHashes.ts --dry-run  # counts only, write nothing
 *   bun ~/.claude/LIFEOS/TOOLS/DeriveDenyHashes.ts --show-tokens  # LOCAL review: print derived
 *                                                                  # plaintext tokens (never persisted)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the hand-maintained DENY_LIST.txt is a BLOCKLIST — it only
 * catches strings someone remembered to add, and it holds them in plaintext.
 * This derives the filter from the private data itself (identity, contacts, gear,
 * TELOS, network topology), so a NEW device / contact / place is auto-forbidden in
 * code the moment it lands in the corpus — and stores only SALTED HASHES, so the
 * filter is opaque even if it leaked. Public LifeOS ships this tool + the guard;
 * each user runs it against their own corpus. No principal data in any shipped file.
 *
 * OUTPUT: LIFEOS/USER/SECURITY/DENY_HASHES.json (USER tree -> excluded from release):
 *   { version, algo, ngramSizes, count, hashes: ["<hex>", ...] }   <- hashes only, no plaintext.
 * SALT: ~/.claude/.env `DENYLIST_SALT` (generated once; never ships). The guard reads
 *   the same salt to reproduce hashes at scan time.
 *
 * FALSE-POSITIVE CONTROL is entirely on THIS side: only distinctive proper-noun-ish
 * tokens are hashed (capitalized, length >= MIN_LEN, not a common word, not on the
 * generic-term allowlist). A content token matches only if it EQUALS a derived
 * token, so filtering here keeps the scan precise. Tune ALLOWLIST/STOPWORDS with
 * --show-tokens.
