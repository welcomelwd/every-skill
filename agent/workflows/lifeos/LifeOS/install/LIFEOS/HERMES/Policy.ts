/**
 * Policy — what a mounted Hermes sidecar may never read, and why.
 *
 * The mount is deliberately generous: the agent sees identity, TELOS, memory,
 * projects, and skills, because a front door that can't see those isn't a front
 * door. This file defines the narrow exception — the credential surface.
 *
 * The distinction that makes a full mount safe:
 *
 *   Secrets get USED, never SEEN. LifeOS skills are CLI-first, so the real work
 *   is a `bun .../Tools/X.ts` subprocess that reads its own credentials in its
 *   own memory. The agent invokes the tool and receives the RESULT. A token
 *   does its job without ever entering the model's context — so a successful
 *   prompt injection has nothing to exfiltrate.
 *
 * This is NOT the containment-zone list. Those zones mark what may hold
 * identity for RELEASE purposes and include the whole USER and MEMORY trees —
 * exactly what the sidecar is supposed to read. Conflating the two produces a
 * mount that can't do anything useful.
 *
 * Install-generic by construction: no home paths, no usernames, no instance
 * literals. Patterns resolve against the running install at emit time.
