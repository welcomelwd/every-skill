# Migrate Agents

![Migrate Agents plugin thumbnail](webui/thumbnail.webp)

Migrate Agents is a bundled Agent Zero plugin for bringing retained work
home from the five most-used open agent harnesses:

- OpenClaw
- Hermes Agent
- OpenCode
- Claude Code
- Codex

The plugin checks an export before importing it. You choose which chats,
projects, memories, instructions, and skills to bring into Agent Zero.
Credentials, authentication files, and hidden reasoning are excluded.

## Enable

Enable **Migrate Agents** in Plugins, then use its **Open** button.

## Prepare an export

| Source | Recommended input |
| --- | --- |
| OpenClaw | `openclaw backup create --verify`, an agent SQLite snapshot, or legacy transcript JSONL |
| Hermes Agent | `hermes sessions export backup.jsonl --redact`, `~/.hermes/state.db`, or a folder/archive containing memories and skills |
| OpenCode | `opencode export <session-id> > session.json`, repeated for each session you want |
| Claude Code | A folder/archive from `~/.claude/projects`, plus any `CLAUDE.md` and skills you want |
| Codex | The `sessions/` and `archived_sessions/` folders beneath `CODEX_HOME` (normally `~/.codex`) |

You can choose individual files, a whole directory, ZIP, TAR, or TAR.GZ. The
preview is read-only. Import does not start until you review the manifest and
confirm it.

## What maps cleanly

| Source material | Agent Zero destination | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User and assistant messages | Native chats | Source ID, timestamps, and workspace metadata are retained when available. |
| Retained workspace paths | Native projects | Chats from the same retained workspace are attached to the same imported project. Project files are not reconstructed from transcript metadata alone. |
| Tool activity | Historical tool records | Sanitized and inert; never replayed as commands. |
| Memory Markdown | `usr/knowledge/_migrate_agents/<source>/memories/` | Each document receives a provenance header. |
| `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and related instructions | `usr/knowledge/_migrate_agents/<source>/instructions/` | Instructions remain separately selectable from memories. |
| Agent Skills containing `SKILL.md` | `usr/skills/_migrate_agents/<source>/` | Complete skill folders are copied under unique names. |
| Attachment references | Chat metadata or text | Binary attachment copying is not automatic. |

## Deliberate privacy boundary

Migrate Agents never imports provider keys, credentials, authentication
state, channel bindings, schedules, hidden reasoning, or live services. It
redacts obvious secret assignments, bearer tokens, private keys, and embedded
data URLs from imported text and tool records. This is defense in depth, not a
guarantee; review migrated material before sharing it.

The Codex adapter follows the preservation and privacy rules of the
`convert-codex-chats` utility skill: public user/commentary/final events are
retained, tool calls and results are paired when available, encrypted or hidden
reasoning is excluded, and historical actions are not presented as replayable.

## Limits

- 5,000 expanded files per migration
- 100 MiB per file
- 256 MiB expanded total
- Preview lists are capped at 200 rows, while import still processes the full accepted bundle
- Modern OpenClaw conversation imports require its per-agent database or transcript artifacts; the global control-plane database does not contain chats

## Development

No third-party Python or JavaScript packages are required.

```bash
python -m pytest plugins/_migrate_agents/tests -q
```
