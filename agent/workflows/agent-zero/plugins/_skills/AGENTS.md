# Skills Plugin DOX

## Purpose

- Own current-chat skill loading and hidden skill configuration.

## Ownership

- `hooks.py` owns skill config normalization.
- `api/skills_catalog.py` owns skill catalog access and loading selected skills into chat history.
- `webui/` owns skill settings UI and store.
- `default_config.yaml`, `plugin.yaml`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE` own defaults, metadata, docs, and license.

## Local Contracts

- Skills selected in `webui/` load into the current chat history only; do not store them as scope defaults.
- Loaded skills are append-only from the user UI because their instructions live in chat history.
- Store configured skills in normalized portable paths.
- Hidden skills affect catalog/search/load visibility but must not remove loaded skill history.

## Work Guidance

- Coordinate skill loading changes with `skills_tool`, loaded-skill history reattachment, and settings UI.

## Verification

- Run skill runtime/catalog tests or smoke-test active, hidden, global, project, and chat-scope behavior after changes.
