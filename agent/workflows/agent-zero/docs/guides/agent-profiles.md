# Agent Profiles and the Agent Editor

Agent Profiles give a chat a repeatable role, set of instructions, model preset,
and capability policy. Use one when you want Agent Zero to work consistently as
a developer, researcher, reviewer, writer, or another specialist.

The Agent Editor is deterministic: it does not call a model to interpret your
changes. It writes only the profile overrides shown in its Review page and
leaves the bundled profiles under `/a0/agents` unchanged.

## Open the Agent Editor

The profile menu is beside the chat input.

![Profile menu with profile rows, Edit actions, and Manage agents](../res/usage/webui/agent-profile-selector.png)

- Select a profile name to use it in the current chat.
- Select **Edit** on a row to open that profile in Easy mode.
- Select **Manage agents** to create, duplicate, reset, delete, or change the
  availability of profiles.

Changing the selected profile affects only that chat. To choose the profile for
future Global chats, open **Settings -> Agent Config**.

## Create or edit a profile in Easy mode

Open **Manage agents**, select **Create agent**, and complete the form:

1. Choose **Global** to make the profile available everywhere, or choose a
   project to keep the profile and its overrides in that project.
2. Enter the agent name. Agent Zero creates a stable profile ID from the name.
3. Optionally choose a color or image.
4. Select a model preset, or keep the current preset.
5. Write direct instructions: what the agent should do, how it should reason,
   and how it should communicate.
6. Review the capability defaults and any individual Tool, MCP, or Skill
   decisions.
7. Select **Create agent** or **Save changes**.

![Easy mode with name, model preset, instructions, and capability defaults](../res/usage/webui/agent-editor-easy.png)

Creating a profile opens a fresh chat with the new profile selected. Editing an
existing profile also offers **Save & test**, which saves and opens a fresh chat
for testing without changing the old chat's history.

### Choose capability access

Easy mode has separate default switches and expandable lists for **Tools**,
**MCPs**, and **Skills**.

![Easy capability editor with Browser explicitly Off and other tools on Default](../res/usage/webui/agent-editor-easy-permissions.png)

Each item has three states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **On** | Always allow this item for the profile. |
| **Default (on/off)** | Follow the category's **Allow ... by default** switch. |
| **Off** | Block this item for the profile. |

Changing a category default affects current and future items that remain on
**Default**. Explicit **On** and **Off** decisions stay pinned. Tools and MCPs
have separate defaults even though their decisions are stored by the same Tool
Access policy owner. Skills use their own visibility policy.

> [!NOTE]
> Skill access controls discovery and new loading. It does not remove skill
> text that is already part of a chat's saved history.

## Manage existing profiles and project availability

**Manage agents** shows the active profile and every profile available to the
selected scope. Use the **Project** selector before making a change.

![Manage agents in Project Showreel with one profile unavailable only in that project](../res/usage/webui/agent-profile-manager.png)

The row actions have distinct effects:

| Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Availability toggle | Show or hide the profile for selection and delegation in the selected scope. |
| **Duplicate** | Create an independent copy with a new ID. |
| **Reset to default** | Remove overrides from the selected scope; bundled originals remain. |
| Edit icon | Open the profile in the selected scope. |
| Delete icon | Permanently delete a custom profile after confirmation. |

To stop a profile from being selected or delegated to in one project:

1. Open **Manage agents**.
2. Choose the project.
3. Turn that profile's availability toggle off.

The Global profile is not deleted or changed. Agent Zero keeps at least one
profile available in every scope; if a chat uses a profile that becomes
unavailable, it is reconciled to an available profile.

## Advanced mode

Select **Advanced** when you need more than the Easy form. The left navigation
separates six concerns:

1. **Identity** — title, description, profile ID, delegation guidance, image,
   and model preset.
2. **Prompt files** — edit individual inherited or customized Markdown prompt
   files in the ACE editor.
3. **Tools** — search local and plugin tools and set their access policy.
4. **MCPs** — set access independently for tools discovered from MCP servers.
5. **Skills** — control which installed skills the profile can discover and
   load.
6. **Review** — inspect the exact files that will be created, updated, or
   deleted before saving.

### Edit prompt files

Choose a prompt file on the left. The editor shows its effective source and the
sparse customization path. **Reset to default** removes only your override for
that file.

![Advanced Prompt files with the customization path and ACE editor](../res/usage/webui/agent-editor-advanced-prompts.png)

### Review explicit capability decisions

Advanced Tools, MCPs, and Skills use the same **On / Default / Off** semantics
as Easy mode, with search and origin filtering. Advanced mode can also show a
retained decision for an item that is not currently available, so you can clear
or change stale configuration.

![Advanced Tools policy with Browser explicitly Off](../res/usage/webui/agent-editor-advanced-tools.png)

### Review before saving

Review is the source of truth for the save. If a file is not listed, the editor
will not write or delete it.

![Advanced Review showing one exact sparse file update](../res/usage/webui/agent-editor-review.png)

For a built-in profile, **Remove my changes** deletes only the selected scope's
overrides. Full deletion is offered only for custom profiles.

## Use profiles from A0 CLI

The [A0 CLI Connector](a0-cli-connector.md) exposes the same profile and
permission owners.

```text
/profile
/profile Developer
/profile "Source Scout" "Verify every important claim and cite the source."
/permissions
```

- `/profile` opens the profile menu. Choose **Create profile** or **Edit current
  profile** for a compact two-step editor.
- `/profile Developer` selects an existing profile by name or ID.
- `/profile "<name>" "<instructions>"` creates a profile in the current chat's
  Global or project scope, then opens a fresh chat with it selected.
- `/permissions` edits Tools, MCPs, and Skills for the current profile. Each row
  cycles through **Default**, **On**, and **Off**; Tools and MCPs have independent
  defaults.

![A0 CLI profile menu after quick-creating a profile](../res/usage/a0-cli/a0-cli-profile-menu.png)

![A0 CLI confirmation after quick profile creation](../res/usage/a0-cli/a0-cli-profile-created.png)

![A0 CLI permission editor for the current profile](../res/usage/a0-cli/a0-cli-permissions.png)

The CLI derives scope from the current chat. It intentionally has no separate
scope selector: a project chat edits that project, while a chat with no project
edits Global.

## Power-user file overrides

Prefer the Agent Editor because it validates changes and shows the exact save
plan. If you manage files directly, use the same sparse layout and formats.

| Scope | Writable profile root |
| --- | --- |
| Global | `/a0/usr/agents/<profile-id>/` |
| Project | `/a0/usr/projects/<project>/.a0proj/agents/<profile-id>/` |

Never edit the bundled `/a0/agents/<profile-id>` files for a customization.
Create only the files and keys you need to override.

```text
<profile-root>/
├── agent.yaml
├── prompts/
│   └── agent.system.main.specifics.md
└── plugins/
    ├── _model_config/config.json
    ├── _tool_access/config.json
    └── _skills/config.json
```

### Identity definition: YAML

Authored profile definitions use YAML. A missing key inherits; an explicitly
empty value clears that field.

```yaml
title: Source Scout
description: Researches technical claims and returns concise evidence.
context: Use this agent for source discovery and claim verification.
```

### Prompt overrides: Markdown

Place a Markdown file under `prompts/` with the same filename as the prompt you
want to replace. Do not copy the whole prompt tree. For example:

```text
prompts/agent.system.main.specifics.md
```

The Agent Editor's Prompt files page is the easiest way to discover available
filenames and the exact customization path. See the
[Prompts guide](https://www.agent-zero.ai/p/docs/prompts/) for the
prompt-loading model.

### Tool and MCP policy: JSON

Runtime and editor-written configuration uses JSON. Tools and MCPs share
`plugins/_tool_access/config.json`, but have independent defaults:

```json
{
  "mode": "custom",
  "default": "allow",
  "mcp_default": "block",
  "allowed": [
    "local:call_subordinate",
    "mcp:deep_wiki:ask_question"
  ],
  "blocked": [
    "plugin:_code_execution:code_execution_tool"
  ]
}
```

Canonical IDs use these forms:

| Source | ID form | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core/local tool | `local:<tool>` | `local:call_subordinate` |
| Plugin tool | `plugin:<plugin-id>:<tool>` | `plugin:_code_execution:code_execution_tool` |
| MCP tool | `mcp:<server>:<tool>` | `mcp:deep_wiki:ask_question` |

An ID in `allowed` is **On**; an ID in `blocked` is **Off**; an ID in neither
list follows `default` or `mcp_default`. Runtime-required response handling is
not offered as a configurable tool.

MCP server definitions themselves still belong in **Settings -> MCP**. The
profile policy decides which discovered MCP tools the agent may use; it does
not create or connect an MCP server. See [MCP Setup](mcp-setup.md).

### Skill visibility policy: JSON

Skills use `plugins/_skills/config.json`. Keep the policy inside
`visibility_policy` so unrelated Skills settings remain intact:

```json
{
  "visibility_policy": {
    "mode": "custom",
    "default": "allow",
    "allowed": ["Research"],
    "blocked": ["Deploy production"]
  }
}
```

The entries are skill names or paths recognized by the Skills catalog. See the
[Skills guide](skills.md) for writing and installing skill definitions.

### Model preset selection: JSON

To pin a profile to an existing preset, use
`plugins/_model_config/config.json`:

```json
{
  "model_preset": "Codex"
}
```

Use **Edit Presets** in the UI to author presets; profile configuration should
only select one. See [Model Presets](model-presets.md).

## Profile, Skill, Project, or model preset?

| Use this | When you want to change |
| --- | --- |
| **Agent Profile** | The agent's role, instructions, model choice, and allowed capabilities. |
| **Skill** | A specific procedure the agent can discover or keep active in a chat. |
| **Project** | Files, workspace, memory, instructions, secrets, and scoped overrides. |
| **Model Preset** | The model configuration used by a chat or profile. |

For small local models that narrate instead of calling tools, use the bundled
**Tiny Local** profile or the project-scoped Prompt Include recipe in
[Local Model Tool Use](local-model-tool-use.md).
