# Quick Start

This guide gets you from install to a first useful chat. Keep it simple: start
Agent Zero, add a model or API key, open the Web UI, and give it a concrete job.

## Installation (recommended)

Choose the path that matches your machine:

- Use [A0 Launcher](guides/launcher.md) if you want a desktop app on a fresh
  machine. It can set up the local runtime, download Agent Zero, open
  Instances, or save a remote Instance URL.
- Use A0 Install if you want the terminal path. The script handles Docker
  detection, image pull, and container setup.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bash.agent-zero.ai | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://ps.agent-zero.ai | iex
```

Follow the CLI prompts for port and authentication, complete onboarding, then open the Web UI URL from the terminal.

> [!TIP]
> To update later, open **Settings UI -> Update tab -> Open Self Update** (see [How to Update](setup/installation.md#how-to-update-agent-zero)). Backups are automatically managed internally.

> [!NOTE]
> For Launcher downloads, headless installer flags, direct Docker, manual Docker Desktop setup, volume mapping, and platform-specific detail, see the [Installation Guide](setup/installation.md).

## Use Agent Zero on your real local files

If you want Agent Zero to work on the actual files on your computer, this is the important part.

Agent Zero stays in Docker for safety. The A0 CLI installs and runs on your host machine. It is not another CLI agent; it is the connector that lets your running Agent Zero instance work on the real files on your real computer.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://cli.agent-zero.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://cli.agent-zero.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Run those on the host machine, not inside the Agent Zero container.

Then launch:

```bash
a0
```

Once `a0` connects, open or create a chat there. The reasoning still belongs to Agent Zero; the CLI is the host bridge that lets it work on real local files on your machine.

For the full setup flow, host picker screenshots, command palette guidance, Browser mode commands, manual fallback install paths, remote-host tips, and a copy-ready brief for another agent, see the [A0 CLI Connector guide](guides/a0-cli-connector.md).

### Open the Web UI and complete onboarding

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<PORT>`. The Web UI will
open on the welcome screen. If models still need setup, send a message or use
the setup shortcuts to choose Cloud, AI account, or Local access, then select
your main and utility models.

For a screenshot walkthrough using OpenRouter, see the
[First-Run Onboarding guide](guides/onboarding.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Agent Zero supports hosted providers, account-backed providers, and local
> models. Choose a strong main model for chat and a fast utility model for
> internal tasks.

### Start your first chat

Once configured, you will see the Agent Zero dashboard.

Click **New Chat** and start with a specific request.

Good first prompts:

```text
Create a short plan for organizing my project notes.
```

```text
Use the Browser to research three options for this tool and summarize the tradeoffs.
```

```text
Help me create a project for this repository and write good instructions for it.
```

> [!TIP]
> The Web UI provides a comprehensive chat actions dropdown with options for managing conversations, including creating new chats, resetting, saving/loading, and many more advanced features. Chats are saved in JSON format in the `/usr/chats` directory.

## Example Interaction

Try a small request first so you can see how Agent Zero thinks, uses tools, and
reports progress.

1. Type a concrete request in the chat input and press Enter.
2. Watch the streamed response and any tool calls.
3. Redirect the agent if it starts moving in the wrong direction.
4. Ask for the final result in the format you want.

Here's an example of what you might see in the Web UI at step 3:

## Next Steps
Now that you've run a simple task, you can experiment with more complex requests. Try asking Agent Zero to:

- Create a project for a focused workspace.
- Use the built-in Browser to research, screenshot, or annotate a page.
- Open the Desktop when you want Linux GUI apps or LibreOffice Cowork.
- Review Memory when Agent Zero seems to keep the wrong assumption.
- Connect A0 CLI when Agent Zero should work on host-machine files.
- Use **+ -> Skills** when you want to pin or remove a skill in the current chat.
- Switch Agent Profiles from the menu near the chat input when you want a different working style.
- Use the first model dropdown when you want to choose or edit Model Presets.
- Attach files and ask for a summary, edit, or conversion.
- Create a scheduled task for recurring work.
- Explore plugins when you need installed integrations or custom UI features.
