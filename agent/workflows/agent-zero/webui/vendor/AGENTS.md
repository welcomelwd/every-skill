# WebUI Vendor Assets DOX

## Purpose

- Own vendored third-party browser libraries served by the WebUI.
- Keep external library updates intentional, isolated, and reviewable.

## Ownership

- Each direct child directory owns one vendored library or library bundle.
- Vendored files should be treated as upstream artifacts, with local edits avoided unless clearly documented.

## Local Contracts

- Do not edit vendored files for application behavior when a wrapper or caller can own the change.
- Preserve license, version, and distribution assumptions for third-party assets.
- Do not add package-manager caches, build outputs, or unrelated downloaded artifacts.

## Work Guidance

- Prefer replacing a vendor bundle with a clean upstream build over hand-editing minified files.
- Coordinate library path changes with all HTML, CSS, and JS imports.

## Verification

- Manually smoke-test UI paths that load an updated vendor library.
- Run frontend checks when imports or wrappers are covered.
