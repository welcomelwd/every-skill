faq:
  - q: "What does human-in-the-loop mean for AI agents?"
    a: "It means a human stays in control of the decisions that matter, while the agents handle everything routine on their own. The skill is in drawing the line: escalate the few critical calls (spend, destructive ops, scope changes) and let the rest run autonomously."
  - q: "Doesn't requiring approvals make agents slow?"
    a: "Only if you approve everything. A good design escalates a small, explicit set of critical actions and resolves the rest automatically, so you're tapped on the shoulder a few times a day, not a few times a minute."
  - q: "How does the human's answer get back to the agent?"
    a: "The escalated item waits in an approvals queue. When you approve or reject — optionally with a note like 'yes, but cap it at $5' — that decision is relayed back to the agent that asked, as a message from the human, and it continues with your guidance."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>Good
<strong>human-in-the-loop AI agents</strong> don't ask permission for everything — they escalate only
the <strong>critical few</strong> (spending money, destructive operations, scope changes,
unresolvable conflicts) to an <strong>approvals queue</strong>, and resolve the rest themselves. Your
answer, with an optional note, is <strong>relayed back</strong> to the agent that asked. The result:
autonomy by default, human judgment exactly where it matters.</p></div>

"Human-in-the-loop" gets misread as "human approves every step." That version is miserable — it turns
a team of agents into a clicking exercise and throws away the whole point of autonomy. The version
that works is the opposite: agents run on their own, and a human is pulled in *only* for the decisions
that genuinely require a person. This post is about designing that line well.

## The trap: approval fatigue

If every file write, every command, every message needs your sign-off, two things happen. First, you
become the bottleneck — the agents are only as fast as your reaction time. Second, you stop reading
the approvals; after the hundredth "can I edit this file?", you click yes on autopilot, which means the
*one* approval that mattered slips through. Asking for everything is functionally the same as asking
for nothing.

So the goal isn't "more approvals." It's **fewer, better** approvals — a queue that stays empty except
when something real needs you.

## Draw the line explicitly

The core design decision is a written list of what counts as **critical**. Everything on the list
escalates to a human; everything else the agents handle. A solid default:

- **Destructive operations** — deleting data, force-pushing, anything hard to undo.
- **Spending real money** — actions with a dollar cost.
- **Scope changes** — work drifting from what you actually asked for.
- **Unresolvable conflicts** — two agents at an impasse that can't be settled internally.

The power of making this *explicit* is that it becomes a control surface you can tune. Too many
interruptions? Tighten the list. Agents doing things that scare you? Loosen what they're allowed to
decide alone. In a hive, this policy lives in the [orchestrator's](/blog/how-the-god-orchestrator-works/)
instructions — so you adjust behavior by editing a prompt, not by shipping code.

## How escalation actually works

When an agent (or the orchestrator on its behalf) hits something critical, it doesn't act. It addresses
a message to the human — or flags the item as needing human attention — and the coordinating process
diverts it into an **approvals queue** instead of delivering it normally. Mechanically it's the same
messaging fabric agents use for each other ([atomic file mailboxes](/blog/atomic-file-mailboxes-for-agents/)),
with one rule: anything marked for the human lands in the queue, not in another agent's inbox.

The queue surfaces in the UI as a short list of "I need your call on these." Each item carries enough
context to decide: who's asking, what they want to do, and why it's critical.

## The answer round-trips

Approval isn't a dead end — it's a conversation. When you resolve an item, two things can travel back:

1. **The decision.** Approve, and the held action proceeds. Reject, and it doesn't.
2. **A note.** You can attach guidance — "yes, but cap it at $5," "no, use the staging DB instead" —
   and that note is relayed back to the agent that asked, as a message from the human.

That round-trip is what makes human-in-the-loop feel like *delegation* rather than *gatekeeping*. The
agent asked a real question; you answered it; it continues with your answer in hand. You're not
blocking the work, you're steering it at the one fork that needed a person.

## Guardrails that keep the queue honest

A couple of structural safeguards keep escalation from being gamed or from livelocking:

- **A hop cap.** If two agents bounce a question back and forth past a limit, the system stops the
  ping-pong and escalates to the human instead of letting it loop forever. The cap is a fuse: when
  agents can't resolve something between themselves, a person breaks the tie.
- **Fail toward asking.** When the system is unsure whether something is critical — an edge case, an
  addressing ambiguity — the safe default is to route it to the human rather than to act. "Ask" is a
  better failure mode than "guess."

These mean the queue catches the things that *should* reach you even when the agents don't explicitly
flag them.

## Why this beats "approve everything" and "approve nothing"

- **vs. approve everything:** you keep autonomy and your attention. The agents do the 95% that's
  routine without you, and the queue stays short enough that you actually read it.
- **vs. approve nothing (full autonomy):** you keep control of the dangerous 5%. Money, destructive
  ops, and scope drift don't happen behind your back — they wait for you.

The selective-escalation model is what lets a hive run unattended for long stretches and still be
safe, which is the foundation of [letting agents build while you sleep](/blog/claude-code-automation-while-you-sleep/):
you wake up to progress plus a short approvals list, not a pile of irreversible actions. It's also the
core of [coordinating AI coding agents](/blog/coordinating-ai-coding-agents/) — the orchestrator
adjudicates the routine traffic and escalates only what it should.

## Designing your own escalation policy

If you're building this, a few principles:

- **Start stricter, then loosen.** Begin with a broader critical list and relax it as you learn what
  the agents handle well. Earning trust beats assuming it.
- **Make every escalation legible.** An approval you can't understand at a glance is one you'll
  rubber-stamp. Include the *why*, not just the *what*.
- **Log every decision.** Approvals and rejections belong in the [event log](/blog/append-only-event-log-agents/)
  so "who approved this?" always has an answer.
- **Keep the human's note actionable.** The point of the round-trip is steering; make it easy to send
  guidance, not just a yes/no.

## FAQ

**What if I'm away when something escalates?** It waits. The held item sits in the queue until you
resolve it — the agent that asked is blocked on that one decision but the rest of the team keeps
working. Nothing critical happens without you.

**Can the agents escalate too much?** They can, early on — which is exactly why the critical list is
tunable. If the queue is noisy, tighten the policy so more decisions are handled autonomously.
