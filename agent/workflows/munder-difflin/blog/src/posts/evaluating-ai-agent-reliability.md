  - q: "How do you measure if an AI agent is reliable enough to trust?"
    a: "Pick a reliability bar and measure against it on tasks like yours. A 50%-reliable agent is a demo; something you'd run unattended needs to be right far more often. METR tracks both 50%- and 80%-reliability horizons for exactly this reason. Then evaluate on your own codebase, not a public benchmark, because curated benchmarks are an optimistic ceiling."
  - q: "Are benchmarks like SWE-bench enough to judge a coding agent?"
    a: "No. SWE-bench Verified is a human-curated set of public GitHub issues confirmed to be solvable with fair tests — useful for comparing models, but an optimistic ceiling. Your private, underspecified, weakly-tested codebase is the harder case the benchmark filters out, so real-world reliability is consistently lower than the headline score."
  - q: "What should an AI agent eval harness measure?"
    a: "Both correctness and the things that actually break agents over long runs. Use verifiable checks (your test suite) as ground truth for 'did it work,' an LLM-as-judge for fuzzier qualities like readability or security (with care — judges are themselves unreliable), and track tool-use consistency, error recovery, and context management. Run it in CI on every change to agent logic, and calibrate against human review on a small sample."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>"Reliable enough" is a
<strong>measurement, not a vibe</strong>. Pick a reliability bar — a 50%-success agent is a demo; something
you trust unattended needs far higher. Treat public benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified as an
<strong>optimistic ceiling</strong>, not a verdict on your codebase. Measure the things that actually
break agents — <strong>tool-use consistency, error recovery, context management</strong> — not just
final-answer accuracy. Then build a lightweight <strong>eval harness on your own work</strong>: verifiable
checks as ground truth, LLM-as-judge for the fuzzy parts (carefully), regression eval in CI, and human
calibration on a sample.</p></div>

Before you hand an agent real work, the question isn't "is it smart?" — it's "how often is it right, on
tasks like mine, at a bar I can live with?" That's an evaluation problem, and most teams skip it, trust a
leaderboard, and get surprised. This is a practical guide to measuring agent reliability honestly.

## Reliability is a number you have to pick

"Reliable" is meaningless without a threshold. The most useful framing comes from
[METR](https://metr.org/time-horizons/), which measures an agent's "task-completion time horizon" at a
*chosen* reliability — and reports it at **both 50% and 80%**. The gap between those two is the whole
point: an agent might handle a long task at coin-flip odds while only reliably finishing a much shorter
one. A 50%-success rate is fine for a demo you supervise; for anything you'd run unattended, you want a
high bar, and you should know which bar you're quoting. Decide your threshold *before* you measure, or
you'll unconsciously pick the number that flatters the agent.

## Benchmarks are a ceiling, not a verdict

Public benchmarks are useful for comparing models and useless as a promise about your code. The standard,
[SWE-bench Verified](https://www.demandsphere.com/research/demandsphere-radar/ai-frontier-model-tracker/benchmarks/swe-bench/),
is a set of real GitHub issues **human-validated to be solvable with fair tests** — top models score
around 80% on it. But that curation is exactly what makes it optimistic: it filters out the unsolvable,
the ambiguous, and the badly-tested — i.e., most of a real backlog. Your private, underspecified,
weakly-tested codebase is the harder case the benchmark removed. As benchmark roundups themselves now
[caution](https://kili-technology.com/blog/ai-benchmarks-guide-the-top-evaluations-in-2026-and-why-theyre-not-enough),
a leaderboard score is a starting point, not a verdict — real-world reliability is consistently lower.

The takeaway isn't "ignore benchmarks." It's: use them to *rank*, then re-measure on *your* work before
you trust anything.

## Measure the things that actually break

Final-answer accuracy hides the failure modes that matter for an autonomous agent. What predicts
real reliability is the stuff that compounds over a long run:

- **Per-step reliability.** Reliability is multiplicative: a 95%-per-step agent is only ~60% reliable
  across a 10-step chain. Measure the chain, not the step.
- **Tool-use consistency.** Does it call the right tool with the right arguments, repeatedly?
- **Error recovery.** When a command fails, does it diagnose and adapt, or loop and flail? This is
  [failure-recovery](/blog/recovering-from-agent-failures/) under measurement.
- **Context management.** Over a long session, does it stay on the original goal or drift?

Production eval frameworks have converged on this multi-dimensional view — see, e.g., this
[12-metric harness distilled from 100+ deployments](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-an-evaluation-harness-for-production-ai-agents-a-12-metric-framework-from-100-deployments/).
The headline accuracy is one column; the ones that catch unattended failures are the others.

## Build an eval harness on your own work

You don't need a research lab — you need a small, repeatable harness over tasks that look like yours.
A practical recipe, drawn from current
[agent-evaluation practice](https://www.adaline.ai/blog/complete-guide-llm-ai-agent-evaluation-2026):

- **Verifiable checks as ground truth.** For "did it work," nothing beats your **test suite**. A task
  with a concrete pass/fail check is the cleanest possible eval signal — and the same tests that grade the
  agent are the bar you should [make it work toward](/blog/claude-code-automation-while-you-sleep/) in the
  first place.
- **LLM-as-judge for the fuzzy parts — carefully.** For readability, security, or "is this a good fix,"
  an LLM grader scales where humans can't, and it pairs naturally with having
  [agents verify their own work](/blog/how-ai-agents-verify-their-own-work/). But judges are themselves
  unreliable: studies find [no judge is uniformly trustworthy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2603.05399), with
  verdicts swinging on formatting, paraphrasing, and verbosity. Use rubrics, and don't treat a judge
  score as gospel.
- **Regression eval in CI.** Run the harness on every change to agent logic or prompts and compare to the
  last run, the way you'd run a test suite — flag improvements and regressions per metric, not just an
  overall pass.
- **Human calibration on a sample.** Have a person review 1–2% of cases and check the judge agrees;
  when they diverge, fix the rubric. Automated eval scales; human eval keeps it honest.

## Close the loop with observability

A reliability number is only as good as the data behind it, and a [multi-agent harness](/#what) is already
producing most of it. Munder Difflin records **real token and cost telemetry** from the agents'
transcripts, keeps an [append-only event log](/blog/append-only-event-log-agents/) of every action, and
tracks task outcomes on a board. That's an eval dataset waiting to be used: success rate per *task type*,
cost per *successful outcome* (a 50x cost spread for similar accuracy is real), and exactly where runs
stall. Feed your [orchestrator's](/#how) own observability back into the eval loop and "is it reliable?"
becomes a trend you watch, not a guess you make.

## A reliability-eval checklist

1. **Pick a reliability bar** (and know whether you're quoting 50% or 80%).
2. **Use benchmarks to rank**, then **re-measure on your own tasks**.
3. **Track the compounding failure modes** — tool use, recovery, context — not just final accuracy.
4. **Ground truth from verifiable checks** (tests); LLM-judge the rest, with rubrics and skepticism.
5. **Run eval in CI** on every change to agent logic; watch regressions.
6. **Calibrate against humans** on a sample, and **feed observability** (cost, outcomes, logs) back in.

Do this and "reliable enough to trust" stops being a leap of faith and becomes a measured, improving
number. The agents that earn unattended work are the ones you've actually evaluated — on your work, at
your bar.
