  - q: "How do AI answer engines decide what to cite?"
    a: "They favor content that's semantically deep, clearly attributed to a recognizable entity, marked up with structured data, and authoritative — and increasingly, content that's already mentioned across the web. It's less about backlinks and page speed than classic Google ranking."
  - q: "Do ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity cite the same sources?"
    a: "Mostly no. Reported analyses find very low overlap — for the same query, a large majority of cited sources appear on only one engine. ChatGPT leans on Wikipedia and Bing's results, Perplexity on Reddit and expert-authored pages, Claude on technical blogs, and Google AI Overviews on YouTube and schema-rich pages."
  - q: "What's the single most effective thing to do for AI citations?"
    a: "Add verifiable specifics. Academic GEO research found that adding statistics, citing sources, and including quotable lines produced the biggest visibility gains in AI answers — on the order of up to ~40%."
  - q: "Is optimizing for AI citation different from SEO?"
    a: "It overlaps but diverges: Google ranks a page to earn a click; an answer engine cites a statement inside a synthesized answer. You optimize the quotable sentence and the entity, not just the page."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>AI answers come with citations — and the
engines <strong>don't pick them the way Google ranks pages</strong>. They cite <em>statements</em>,
favoring semantic depth, clear entity identity, structured data, and authority. And they
<strong>disagree</strong>: ChatGPT leans Wikipedia + Bing, Perplexity leans Reddit + expert authors,
Claude leans technical blogs, Google AI Overviews lean YouTube + schema. There's no single "rank" to
win — you optimize per engine. Here's how each one actually chooses, grounded in 2026 research.</p></div>

When ChatGPT or Perplexity answers a question, it footnotes a handful of sources. Land in that handful
and you're visible to everyone who asked; miss it and you're invisible — no second page to scroll to.
So the practical question for anyone publishing on the web is no longer just "how do I rank?" but
**"how does an answer engine decide what to cite?"** The honest answer: differently than Google, and
differently from each other. This is the companion to our
[AEO playbook for dev tools](/blog/what-is-aeo-for-dev-tools/) — that post is *what to do*; this one is
*how the engines actually choose*.

## The shift: citing statements, not ranking pages

The one sentence that reframes everything: **Google ranks pages; AI engines cite statements.** A
ranked page earns a click; a cited statement gets lifted into a synthesized answer, often with no click
at all. That's why the signals diverge. Generative engines lean less on classic backlinks, page speed,
and keyword density, and more on **semantic depth, entity clarity, structured data, and source
authority**. The unit that wins isn't the page — it's the quotable, attributable claim.

There's real research behind the tactics. Academic work formalizing **Generative Engine Optimization**
(from Princeton, Georgia Tech, and the Allen Institute for AI) found that targeted content techniques
lifted a source's visibility in AI answers by [up to roughly 40%](https://aithinkerlab.com/generative-engine-optimization-2026/) —
with the biggest gains from **adding statistics, citing sources, and including quotations**. In other
words: specific, verifiable, quotable content is what gets pulled into answers.

## The engines don't agree — a per-engine tour

Here's the part most "AI SEO" advice glosses over: the major engines cite *strikingly different*
sources. Reported analyses (notably the [5W AI Platform Citation Source Index 2026](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/5w-releases-ai-platform-citation-source-index-2026-the-50-websites-that-now-decide-what-brands-are-visible-inside-chatgpt-claude-perplexity-gemini-and-google-ai-overviews-302759804.html)
and [Discovered Labs](https://discoveredlabs.com/blog/ai-citation-patterns-how-chatgpt-claude-and-perplexity-choose-sources)) — single-source indices, so treat the exact percentages as illustrative — paint a consistent picture of divergence:

- **ChatGPT → Wikipedia + Bing.** It leans heavily on Wikipedia (a big share of its top citations) and
  pulls from Bing's top results, with high overlap between Bing rankings and what ChatGPT cites.
  Notably, **brand mentions across the web are among the strongest predictors of being cited** — being
  *talked about* matters as much as being linked.
- **Perplexity → Reddit + expert authority.** It favors Reddit and weights domain authority, **recency**,
  factual density, and the presence of **named, verifiable expert authors**.
- **Claude → technical blogs.** Its Constitutional-AI bias tilts toward trustworthy, technically precise
  sources — it rewards an authoritative tone, explicit citations, and accuracy over marketing copy.
- **Google AI Overviews → YouTube + schema.** They lean on video and **weight structured-data markup
  heavily** while moderating the influence of backlinks.

And the concentration is extreme: reported data suggests the **top ~15 domains capture roughly 68% of
all AI citation share** — more concentrated than Google's PageRank ever was — while only a small
fraction of domains get cited by more than one engine for the same query. There is no single ranking to
win; there are several, and they barely overlap.

## What this means if you want to be cited

Translate the divergence into action:

- **Optimize the entity, not just the page.** Engines reward a recognizable *thing* with a consistent
  name, description, and `sameAs` links. Be a clear entity before you worry about individual pages.
- **Earn mentions, not only links.** Since brand mentions predict ChatGPT citation, being discussed
  (forums, communities, others' posts) is its own optimization — not just backlink building.
- **Write with verifiable specifics.** The GEO research is blunt about it: add statistics, cite your
  sources, include quotable lines. It's the highest-leverage edit you can make.
- **Lead with authority and precision for the technical engines.** Claude and Perplexity reward named
  expertise and factual density — a real author and exact claims beat anonymous marketing prose.
- **Ship structured data.** `FAQPage`, `SoftwareApplication`, and `BlogPosting` markup help every engine
  parse what your content *is* — and Google AI Overviews weight it especially.

None of this replaces good SEO — crawlable, fast, well-structured pages still matter. It layers a
second discipline on top, aimed at the quotable claim instead of the click.

## How to know if it's working

AEO has no clean "position 3" metric, so measure it directly: each month, ask ChatGPT, Claude, and
Perplexity the questions your audience would ask, and check whether you're named — and whether the
description matches what you wrote. Because the engines diverge, track them separately; being cited by
Perplexity tells you little about ChatGPT. (The fuller measurement-and-tactics version lives in our
[AEO playbook](/blog/what-is-aeo-for-dev-tools/), and the [Munder Difflin FAQ](/blog/munder-difflin-faq/)
is a worked example of one-sentence, quotable answers.)

## The bottom line

**AI answer engines choose what to cite by trustworthy, structured, entity-clear, quotable content —
and each one weights it differently.** Stop chasing a single rank; build a recognizable entity, earn
mentions, write verifiable specifics, and mark it all up — then verify by asking the engines directly.
The same content that an AI will confidently quote is the content a human will trust.
