  - q: "What is markdown-first agent memory?"
    a: "It's an approach where each agent's durable knowledge lives in plain markdown files it reads on startup and appends to as it learns. A semantic index is built on top of those files for fast recall — but the markdown, not the index, is the source of truth."
  - q: "Why not just use a vector database for agent memory?"
    a: "A vector DB stores opaque embeddings you can't read or diff, and many memory frameworks want to own the agent's runtime. Markdown-first keeps memory human-readable and git-diffable, treats the index as a removable accelerator, and fits agents whose runtime is already Claude Code."
  - q: "What happens if the semantic index breaks?"
    a: "Nothing catastrophic — the agent falls back to reading its markdown directly. Because the files are the source of truth and the index sits on top, a broken or missing index degrades to plain markdown memory instead of losing everything."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>We built
<strong>AI agent long-term memory</strong> markdown-first: each agent writes durable facts to plain
markdown files, and a semantic index sits <em>on top</em> for fast recall. The reason is durability —
markdown is <strong>human-readable</strong>, <strong>git-diffable</strong>, and <strong>degrades
gracefully</strong> (if the index breaks, the files still work). A vector database can't say the same,
and it's the wrong fit when the agent's runtime is already Claude Code.</p></div>

When you add long-term memory to an agent, the tempting first move is to reach for a vector database or
a full memory framework. We went the other way: plain markdown files first, with a semantic index
layered on top. This post is the argument for that ordering — why the *source of truth* should be
files you can read, and the index should be a removable accelerator.

## What "markdown-first" means

The design is simple. Each agent has a `memory.md`. The rule it follows:

- **Read it at the start of a task** — recall what you already know before starting.
- **Append durable facts as you learn them** — a decision, a convention, a gotcha — in small, atomic
  entries.

```markdown
## build
- The web bundle is built with electron-vite, NOT plain vite. Use `npm run build`.
- node-pty needs an electron-rebuild after install (the postinstall handles it).
- Never hand-edit docs/index.html during a release — it's the REL fallback source.
```

A semantic index is built *from* these files so the agent can recall by meaning instead of re-reading
everything ([semantic memory for AI agents](/blog/semantic-memory-for-ai-agents/) covers that layer).
But the markdown is primary. The index is derived, and disposable.

## Three reasons the ordering matters

### 1. Memory you can read is memory you can trust

Open an agent's `memory.md` and you see exactly what it "knows" — in your language, not as a blob of
floating-point vectors. That's not a nicety; it's how you debug an agent that's acting on a stale or
wrong belief. With markdown, you find the bad note and fix it. With opaque embeddings, you're guessing
at what the agent remembers and re-indexing to change it. The most important property of a memory
system is that a human can audit it, and plain text wins that outright.

### 2. Memory that diffs is memory you can review

Because the notes are files, they live in git. Every change to what an agent knows is a diff you can
read in a commit — memory becomes reviewable like any other artifact. You can watch an agent's
understanding evolve, catch the moment it learned something wrong, and roll it back. A database of
embeddings has no meaningful diff; "the vectors changed" tells you nothing. Text under version control
turns memory from a black box into a reviewable record, which pairs naturally with the
[append-only event log](/blog/append-only-event-log-agents/) for full auditability.

### 3. Memory that degrades gracefully never strands you

This is the durability clincher. If the semantic index breaks, isn't installed, or you move to a
machine without it, the markdown files **still work** — the agent reads them directly. The fancy recall
is an upgrade, not a dependency. Contrast a database that won't open: it takes the memory with it. With
markdown-first, the floor never falls out from under the agent; the worst case is slower recall, not
lost knowledge.

## Why not a vector database or a memory framework?

Vector DBs and dedicated memory frameworks are real tools with real uses. They're the wrong default
*here* for two reasons.

**They store what you can't read.** Their native unit is the embedding — great for similarity search,
useless for human inspection or git review. You end up bolting a "show me the source text" layer back
on, which is just markdown wearing a costume.

**They want to own the runtime.** Many agent-memory frameworks assume *they* are the thing running the
agent loop — they expect to be in charge. But when your agents are real `claude` sessions, the runtime
is already Claude Code. The memory layer should be a lightweight companion beside it, not a framework
that wants to replace it. Markdown files plus a CLI-driven index fit that shape exactly: the agent
writes notes as a normal part of its work, and a separate process mines those notes into a searchable
store without intruding on the loop.

That mining is the bridge: the index reads each agent's markdown and makes it recall-able by the whole
team, on a schedule, only re-processing files that changed. You get vector-quality recall *and*
human-quality source text — because the vectors are derived from the text, not instead of it.

## The single-writer detail

One subtlety that markdown-first gets right almost for free: **one writer per memory file.** Each agent
owns its own `memory.md` and only it appends there. A shared index aggregates everyone's notes
read-only, so the whole team can recall across agents without any file being written by two processes.
It's the same single-writer discipline that keeps
[multi-agent git safe](/blog/single-committer-git-pattern/) — applied to memory. Co-edited memory files
would tear; per-agent files plus a read-only shared index don't.

## When markdown-first is the right call

This approach shines when:

- you want to **audit and trust** what your agents remember,
- you want memory **under version control** so you can review and revert it,
- your agents' runtime is something you don't control (a CLI like Claude Code), and
- you value **graceful degradation** over maximal indexing sophistication.

It's less compelling if you're building a system at a scale where you genuinely need a dedicated vector
store's throughput and you're willing to give up readability for it. For a hive of a handful to a few
dozen agents, markdown-first is the durable, debuggable default. For the plain-English version of why
agents forget and what shared memory changes, see
[how to give Claude Code long-term memory](/blog/give-claude-code-long-term-memory/).

## FAQ

**Doesn't markdown get unwieldy at thousands of notes?** The *files* stay fine; the challenge is recall,
which is exactly what the semantic index on top solves — you recall the few relevant notes by meaning
rather than reading them all. The markdown scales as storage; the index scales as retrieval.

**Can I edit an agent's memory by hand?** Yes — it's a text file. Fix a wrong note, remove a stale one,
and the next mining pass picks up the change. Try that with a vector store.
