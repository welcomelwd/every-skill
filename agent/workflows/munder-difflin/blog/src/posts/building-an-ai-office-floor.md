  - q: "What game-dev techniques does an AI office floor use?"
    a: "Tiled tile maps for the level, a grid pathfinder for movement, sprite-sheet slicing and recoloring for distinct avatars, a seat-reservation pool for desk assignment, and tween-based animation for flying message envelopes — all rendered with a 2D engine like Pixi.js."
  - q: "Do you need a game engine to build an office floor?"
    a: "No — a 2D renderer like Pixi.js plus a few classic techniques is enough. The map comes from the Tiled editor, pathfinding is a small BFS, and avatars are sprite sheets. It's game tech, but lightweight enough to live inside a developer tool."
  - q: "How are the avatars made distinct?"
    a: "They start from a shared character walk sheet and are recolored per character with palette recipes (skin, hair, shirt), so each agent reads as a different person on the floor without drawing every sprite by hand."

<div class="callout tldr"><span class="ic">TL;DR</span><p>An <strong>AI agent visualization</strong>
that looks like a tiny office game uses ordinary game-dev tech: a <strong>Tiled</strong> tile map for
the floor, a small <strong>BFS pathfinder</strong> for movement, <strong>sprite-sheet</strong> slicing

<strong>envelopes</strong> for messages — all in Pixi.js. None of it is heavy; it's game craft applied
to a developer tool.</p></div>

The office floor in Munder Difflin looks like a little workplace sim, and that's on purpose — a
spatial, game-like view makes a hive of agents legible. Under the hood it's a handful of classic
game-development techniques, kept deliberately lightweight so they fit inside a dev tool. This post is
the techniques tour. (For *why* a visualization matters and the Pixi.js plumbing, start with
[visualizing AI agents with Pixi.js](/blog/visualizing-ai-agents-pixijs/).)

A note up front: several of these pieces are ported from an open-source 2D office game
(shahar061/the-office), with character art from LimeZu's sprite packs. Standing on game-dev shoulders
is exactly the point — these are solved problems.

## The floor is a Tiled map

The office isn't drawn in code; it's authored in **Tiled**, the standard 2D map editor, and exported as
a `.tmj` (JSON) file. The renderer reads its layers:

- **Tile layers** — floor, walls, furniture — drawn from tileset textures. Each tile references a
  global id, resolved back to the right tileset by its `firstgid` offset.
- A **collision layer** — which tiles are solid (walls, desks) versus walkable floor.
- A **spawn-points** object layer — named anchors for desks and seats.

Because the level is data, changing the office is a *design* task: open the map in Tiled, move a desk,
re-export. No code changes to rearrange the furniture. One subtlety worth stealing: desk/seat tiles are
marked solid for collision but force-flagged *walkable* for pathing, so an avatar can walk *onto* its
chair instead of treating it as a wall.

## Movement is grid pathfinding

Avatars walk from their desk to a station and back. The pathfinder is a **breadth-first search** on the
map's walkability grid — four-directional, no diagonals:

```ts
// BFS over walkable tiles → shortest tile path from start to goal
function findPath(map, start, goal) {
  if (!map.isWalkable(goal.x, goal.y)) return null;
  const queue = [start], visited = new Set([key(start)]), parent = new Map();
  while (queue.length) {
    const cur = queue.shift();
    for (const d of [{x:0,y:-1},{x:0,y:1},{x:-1,y:0},{x:1,y:0}]) {
      const next = { x: cur.x + d.x, y: cur.y + d.y };
      if (visited.has(key(next)) || !map.isWalkable(next.x, next.y)) continue;
      visited.add(key(next)); parent.set(key(next), cur);
      if (next.x === goal.x && next.y === goal.y) return reconstruct(parent, start, goal);
      queue.push(next);
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

On an unweighted grid, BFS returns the shortest path for free — no heuristic, no priority queue, no A*
needed at office scale. It's a dozen lines and it's correct, which is the right trade for a map this
size.

## Avatars: one sheet, many people

Drawing fifteen unique characters by hand would be a slog. Instead, avatars start from a shared
**character walk sheet** and are made distinct by *recoloring*:

- A **sprite adapter** slices the sheet into frames — walk cycles for each facing direction. The sheet
  packs directions in a known order (right, up, left, down); the adapter maps them into the
  three-row grid the renderer wants, and *left* is just *right* drawn flipped, so you store fewer
  frames.
- The **character sprite** plays walk / type / read / idle animations and applies a small **leg-crop
  mask** when an agent sits, so it tucks under the desk instead of standing on it.
- Each character gets a **palette recipe** — skin, hair, shirt — so the cast is visually distinct from
  one base sheet. (If the cast looks suspiciously like a certain paper company's staff, that's not an
  accident.)

The payoff: a recognizable, individuated team without an artist hand-drawing every avatar.

## Seats: a reservation pool

When an agent joins, it needs a desk. A tiny **seat pool** holds the ordered list of spawn points from
the map and hands out the first free one, releasing it when the agent leaves:

```ts
reserveNext() {                      // first unclaimed seat, in map order
  for (const seat of this.seats)
    if (!this.claimed.has(seat)) { this.claimed.add(seat); return seat; }
  return null;                       // office is full
}
```

First-come, first-served, one desk each — so a growing team fills the office in order rather than
stacking onto one chair. Thirty-three lines of bookkeeping that make dynamic agents Just Work.

## Envelopes: messages you can see fly

When the hive routes a message between agents, the floor spawns a little pixel **envelope** that arcs
from the sender's desk to the recipient's. The animation is a quadratic arc — lerp the endpoints, lift
the midpoint with a sine — eased in and out, with a small burst ring on arrival. The envelope is
**tinted by the message's speech act**: asks are cool-colored, agreements and confirmations warm,
refusals red, and an escalation to the human a distinct color. So you don't just see *that* a message
moved — you see *who asked whom, and what kind of ask it was*, at a glance.

That envelope is pure presentation riding on real data: it only flies because the
[message router](/blog/atomic-file-mailboxes-for-agents/) actually delivered something.

## Keeping it lightweight

The whole point is that this is *game tech in a dev tool*, not a game. So the implementation stays
lean: pixel-art settings (no antialias, nearest-neighbor scaling, integer positions), a single shared
animation ticker, and a camera that transforms one world container rather than every sprite. That
discipline is what lets the floor run alongside a fleet of live terminals without contention — the same
performance mindset as [rendering many live terminals](/blog/rendering-many-live-terminals-performance/).

## Why borrow from games at all

Developer tools usually present work as text. A spatial, animated floor borrows what games are great at
— making *state* immediately readable through position and motion — and applies it to "what is my team
of agents doing?" The techniques are old and solved; the novelty is pointing them at observability
instead of entertainment. An avatar at the terminal, an envelope in flight, a teammate waving for your
input: that's a status dashboard you read with your eyes instead of your patience.

## FAQ

**Is the office floor just eye candy?** No — it's observability. Every position and motion maps to a
real event (a tool call, a routed message), so the floor is a live, glanceable read of the hive's
state, not decoration.

**Do I need to know game dev to build something like this?** Not deeply. A 2D renderer, the Tiled
editor, a BFS, and sprite sheets get you most of the way. These are approachable, well-documented
techniques — the hard part is wiring them to *real* agent events, not the rendering.
