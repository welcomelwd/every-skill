faq:
  - q: "Is Munder Difflin free?"
    a: "Yes. Munder Difflin is free and open source under the MIT license. Download a build for macOS, Windows, or Linux, or run it from source — and once installed, the app keeps itself up to date from GitHub releases, telling you what's in each update before you restart into it."
  - q: "Do I need Claude Code to use Munder Difflin?"
    a: "No — you need at least one supported engine, and Claude Code is the most popular of ten: Claude Code, Antigravity, Codex, Grok, Kimi, Qwen, OpenCode, Crush, pi, and GitHub Copilot CLI. Each agent runs a real CLI process; the harness adds memory, messaging, skills, and the orchestrator on top. Mixing engines on one floor is normal."
  - q: "Does it work properly on Windows?"
    a: "Yes — and if you tried before v0.4.4, try again. That release fixed the bug that silently broke agent-to-agent messaging on Windows, made first runs start their own hive services, and rebuilt dark mode. Windows is a first-class platform now, OpenCode included."
  - q: "Can I leave it running for hours or days?"
    a: "Yes — that's the point. With auto mode on, agents run unattended and Michael routes work and escalates only the critical calls to you. Give an agent a persistent Goal and it keeps working a long-horizon task across many prompts while you're away."
  - q: "Is auto mode safe?"
    a: "Auto mode spawns agents without per-tool permission prompts, so they don't pause for file edits or shell commands. It's the right default for the unattended control-room experience, but it's a foot-gun on production repos. Keep it on for sandboxed or disposable working copies; turn it off (or per agent) when you want to babysit."

Most tools help you run one coding agent. Munder Difflin helps you run a *team* of them —
unattended, coordinated, and aimed at the big jobs: a multi-day refactor, a migration, an
investigation that needs to grind overnight. This is the start-to-finish guide, current as of
**v0.4.4**: install it, meet your clone, and put the hive to work on something ambitious.

## What Munder Difflin does best

Before the steps, the mental model — because it shapes how you'll use it. Munder Difflin wraps the
agent CLIs you already run as full agents, gives each **long-term memory** and a **mailbox**, and
puts **Michael** in charge — a clone of you, the one agent *you* talk to. His card says **BOSS**:
he's the boss of the agents, you're still the boss of him. You describe intent; he routes work,
lets agents message each other, and escalates only the critical calls to you.

That design pays off most on **long-horizon work**. A single session loses steam (and context) on a
multi-hour task. A coordinated [hive that remembers](/blog/give-claude-code-long-term-memory/) can
keep going for hours or days — the [overnight, while-you-sleep](/blog/run-an-office-of-ai-agents/)
use case is exactly what it's built for. Keep that in mind as you set it up.

## Step 1: What you'll need

- **At least one supported agent CLI** on your `PATH`. Ten engines are first-class: **Claude Code,
  Antigravity, Codex, Grok, Kimi, Qwen, OpenCode, Crush, pi, and GitHub Copilot CLI.** Bring
  whichever subscriptions you already have — mixing engines on one floor is normal.
- **From source only:** Node.js 18+ with npm, and a C/C++ toolchain for `node-pty`'s native addon
  (Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, `build-essential` on Linux, VS Build Tools on Windows).
  Prebuilt apps need none of this.
- *Optional:* **MemPalace**, the semantic memory index, for instant cross-session recall. The app
  works without it — plain-markdown memory still functions.

And here's the v0.4.4 upgrade to this whole step: you don't have to audit any of it by hand.
**Settings → Prerequisites** shows live status for uv, git, Node, MemPalace and every engine —
with real paths, the platform-correct install command for anything missing, and a button that
asks Michael to fill the gaps for you.

{% img "note-1", "The Prerequisites page does this checklist for you — live status, real paths, and Michael on standby to install what's missing." %}

## Step 2: Install it

There are two paths. Pick whichever fits you.

### Option A — Download a build (easiest)

Grab the installer for your OS from the [download section](/#install) (it points at the latest
release):

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS | `Munder-Difflin-<version>-mac-universal.dmg` (Apple Silicon + Intel) |
| Windows | `Munder-Difflin-<version>-win-x64-setup.exe` (64-bit installer) |
| Linux | `Munder-Difflin-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` |

Open the installer, launch the app, and skip to [first launch](#step-3-first-launch-the-onboarding-wizard).
From here the app maintains itself: updates download in the background from GitHub releases, the
toast tells you what's actually in them, and installation only ever happens on your click.
(**Settings → General** also answers "am I on the latest?" with a single Check-for-updates button.)

A word to Windows users specifically: **v0.4.4 is the release that made Windows first-class.**
Agent-to-agent messaging, first-run hive services, the setup wizard, dark mode — all fixed. If an
earlier version burned you, [this one is owed to you](/blog/launching-munder-difflin-v0-4-4/).

### Option B — Build from source (two commands)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin.git
cd munder-difflin
npm install        # postinstall rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI
npm run dev        # launches the app with hot reload
```

The `npm install` step rebuilds the native terminal addon for your machine. If `node-pty` ever fails
to load after an Electron upgrade, re-run `npm install` to rebuild it.

## Step 3: First launch — the onboarding wizard

First launch opens on what the product actually is — **a clone of you, working 24/7** — then asks
the few questions that matter:

1. **Your clone's engine.** Michael runs on a pluggable engine; the card names all ten. Claude
   Code is the natural default, and you can change it later.
2. **Harness home.** A folder where the harness keeps its own files — agent metadata, memory,
   mailboxes, logs. `~/HarnessAgents` is a fine default. The wizard validates this immediately:
   an empty or impossible folder fails at step one, not after step four.
3. **Your repos.** Add the project folders you want agents to work in. Each becomes a room on the
   floor; multiple agents can share a repo. Optional, and you can add more later.
4. **Auto mode.** Confirm whether agents run unattended (covered next). There's also a "share
   anonymous usage stats" toggle — opt-out, governed by a
   [public contract](https://github.com/chaitanyagiri/munder-difflin/blob/main/TELEMETRY.md).

Finish the wizard and you land on the office floor. Michael boots into his office automatically —
and everything the hive needs (message router, hook server, mission scheduler) starts with him,
on the very first run.

## Step 4: Meet Michael, your clone

Michael runs the floor: he triages requests, assigns work, and escalates only the critical calls
to you. He's the agent you talk to.

To talk to any agent (Michael included), select them on the floor to open their panel, then use the
**command bar** at the bottom — type a message and hit Enter. The bar has three modes:

- **free** — plain natural-language instructions (the default).
- **/skill** — invoke an installed skill or slash command.
- **quick** — fast canned actions.

Talking to Michael in plain language is how you steer the whole team: describe a goal, and he
decomposes and routes it. You manage, he delegates. He also listens — his voice mode opens with a
live floor snapshot and can run nearly the whole app hands-free. (New to the idea? [How to run
multiple Claude Code agents](/blog/how-to-run-multiple-claude-code-agents/) covers why an
orchestrator beats juggling tabs.)

## Step 5: Understand auto mode

Auto mode is what makes unattended runs possible. With it on, agents are spawned with their
engine's permission prompts bypassed — Claude Code, for instance, runs as:

```text
claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions
```

That means the agent won't stop to ask before editing files or running shell commands — essential
for a "set it going and walk away" workflow. It's also a loaded foot-gun on a production repo, so:

- **Keep auto mode on** for sandboxed, disposable, or branch-isolated working copies — anywhere a
  mistake is cheap to undo.
- **Turn it off** (or drop it for a single agent in the Add Agent dialog) when you want to babysit
  a sensitive repo and approve each tool call.

Either way, Munder Difflin keeps a **human-in-the-loop approvals queue**: even in auto mode,
Michael escalates genuinely critical actions (spending real money, destructive operations, big
scope changes) for your sign-off, so unattended doesn't mean unsupervised.

## Step 6: Spin up your first agent

Click **Add agent** to open the spawn dialog. The fields:

- **Name** — the agent's handle (picking a character fills this in for you).
- **Folder** — the working directory. Pick a registered repo with a click, or browse.
- **Engine & model** — any of the ten engines, with a model picker per engine (Grok 4.6 landed in
  v0.4.4). The harness restarts the agent on the new model if you change it later.
- **Description** — a short note on what this agent is for.
- **Goal (optional)** — *a long-running directive injected on every prompt.* The most important
  field for long tasks (more below).
- **Character & Color** — pick from the office cast and an accent.
- **Git isolation (optional)** — auto-creates a dedicated git worktree for this agent and tears it
  down when you kill it. Use it whenever two agents share a repo.

Hit **spawn**. The agent appears as an avatar at a desk, provisioned in the hive with its own
memory, mailbox, and identity. Envelopes fly desk-to-desk when agents message each other.

{% img "note-2", "One dialog, one new hire: engine, model, goal, character — and a desk appears on the floor." %}

## Step 7: Give your agents skills

Before the big task, arm the team. **Skills** (new in v0.4.4) is a browsable catalog of hundreds
of installable skills — search, category and publisher filters, one-click install across Claude
Code, OpenCode and Codex, with scope precedence handled and uninstall guarded. A reviewer with a
review checklist beats a generalist told to "review carefully"; a writer with your style guide
beats one guessing at your voice. ([MCP and skills in a hive](/blog/mcp-and-skills-in-a-hive/)
covers when skills beat tools.)

## Step 8: Run an ambitious, long-horizon task

Here's where Munder Difflin earns its keep. To set a team working for hours or days:

1. **Give agents a persistent Goal.** The *Goal* field is injected into every prompt, so the agent
   keeps orienting toward the same directive even as the conversation turns over. Write it like a
   brief: *"Migrate the test suite from Mocha to Vitest, one directory at a time, keeping CI green
   after each."*
2. **Let Michael route the rest.** Tell him the high-level objective and let him assign sub-tasks.
   You describe the *what*; the hive figures out the *who* and *when*.
3. **Scope each agent and let them coordinate.** Clear roles, handoffs through mailboxes, and
   shared [long-term memory](/blog/give-claude-code-long-term-memory/) so what one agent learns,
   the next inherits.
4. **Walk away.** With auto mode on, the team keeps going unattended. Check the approvals queue
   when you're back; Michael only interrupts you for the critical calls.

This is the [run-an-office-while-you-sleep](/blog/run-an-office-of-ai-agents/) workflow, and the
practical guardrails are in [Claude Code automation while you
sleep](/blog/claude-code-automation-while-you-sleep/). Be honest about scope — bounded,
well-specified jobs go best.

## Step 9: Use Michael's Command Center

Select Michael on the floor and open his panel — a control surface, not a plain terminal:

- **Terminal** — Michael's live session, plus a message queue so you can park tasks while he works.
- **Floor** — the full agent roster with per-agent model selectors, a dispatch box, and your
  registered repos. The **Enrich** toggle routes queued messages through a background prep
  assistant who gathers context before Michael sees them.
- **Memory** — MemPalace semantic search plus full-text search across all hive files, and a
  memory graph.
- **Activity** — live event log, the shared board, and real token + cost telemetry per agent.
- **Tasks** — a dependency-aware kanban board Michael and his team track status on.
- **Triggers** — every way the office wakes itself: recurring missions with a label, interval,
  and directive body, dispatched to the target agent automatically.

For long-running floors, Triggers is the most powerful tab: a "30-minute floor check" mission
pointed at Michael — *"Are all agents making progress? Re-engage anyone idle."* — keeps the team
moving even when you're away.

## Tips for best results

- **Scope beats ambition.** A precise Goal runs longer and cleaner than a vague one.
- **Use git isolation.** Auto mode plus per-agent worktrees means mistakes are cheap and agents
  never collide on branches.
- **Register your repos.** Pre-adding projects makes spawning agents one click.
- **Lean on memory.** Tell agents to write durable facts to their notes; the shared semantic
  palace turns those into instant recall for the whole hive.
- **Watch the floor early.** Seeing who's busy, idle, or blocked catches problems before they
  compound — fullscreen roster cards even show each agent's live context gauge.

## Troubleshooting

- **`node-pty` fails to load after an update** (source builds) → re-run `npm install`.
- **Agents won't start / "command not found"** → open **Settings → Prerequisites**; it shows
  which engine binaries the app can actually see, with install commands for the missing ones.
- **Native build errors on `npm install`** → install your platform's C/C++ toolchain, reinstall.
- **No instant recall** → MemPalace is optional; without it, markdown memory still works, just
  without fast semantic search.
- **On Windows and something's off?** Make sure you're on v0.4.4 or later — it's the release
  that fixed agent messaging, first-run services, and the wizard on Windows.
