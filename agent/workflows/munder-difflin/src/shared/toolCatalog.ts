/**
 * The setup catalog — every EXTERNAL tool the harness can use, what it buys the
 * user, and how to install it on this platform.
 *
 * Why this file exists: the app ships as one Electron bundle, but several of its
 * best features are thin wrappers over tools that live outside it — mempalace for
 * semantic memory, uv to install mempalace, git for worktrees, and one CLI per
 * agent engine. Every one of them degrades SILENTLY when absent (that is the
 * deliberate design — `memory.start()` is a documented no-op without mempalace),
 * which is friendly right up until the user cannot tell "off" from "broken" and
 * has no single place that says which is which. This catalog is that place.
 *
 * The engine rows are DERIVED from AGENT_PROVIDER_PRESETS rather than restated
 * here: those presets already carry `defaultCommand`, `installCommand`,
 * `nativeInstallCommand` and `docsUrl`, and a second hand-maintained copy would
 * drift the moment a provider is added.
