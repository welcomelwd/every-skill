/**
 * The Settings hero card's remote payload.
 *
 * Lives as JSON in this repo and is fetched at runtime, so plan copy and
 * sponsors can change without shipping a build. It is DATA, never markup — that
 * distinction is the whole security story here:
 *
 *   - every field is rendered by React as a text node, so it is escaped; there is
 *     no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere on this path and adding one would
 *     turn a config file into a script-injection surface;
 *   - URLs are validated to https and opened through the existing `openExternal`
 *     bridge, which independently refuses anything that is not https;
 *   - strings are LENGTH-CAPPED, because the failure mode of unbounded remote
 *     text is not a security hole but a wrecked layout in a dialog the user
 *     cannot then use;
 *   - unknown fields are ignored and a malformed payload falls back to the baked
 *     defaults, so a bad edit degrades to "looks like it always did" rather than
 *     to an empty or broken card.
 *
 * The parse is deliberately total: `parseHeroPayload` never throws and always
 * returns something renderable.
