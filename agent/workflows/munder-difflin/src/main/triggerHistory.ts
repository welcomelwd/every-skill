/**
 * The trigger ledger on disk — every inbound message a webhook or a peer's clone
 * node pushed at us, and every reply we sent back.
 *
 * It lives in its OWN file rather than in config.json for two reasons: it is
 * append-heavy (config.json is rewritten wholesale on every `writeConfig`, so a
 * growing array in it would make every unrelated settings write more expensive),
 * and it is disposable — losing history must never be able to cost the user their
 * settings. Structurally it follows config.ts: sync fs, mkdirSync-on-write, and a
 * try/catch around every disk touch that degrades to an empty ledger. Nothing here
 * throws at its caller, because the caller is always on a request path where
 * failing to RECORD an event must not fail the event itself.
 *
 * SECURITY — NEVER write a secret, API key or token into an entry. The ledger is
 * plaintext JSON in userData and is surfaced verbatim in the UI, so a webhook
 * secret or an org apiKey landing here would be a durable leak of a live
 * credential. Entries are therefore built FIELD BY FIELD below rather than by
 * spreading the caller's object: a caller that hands us a whole `WebhookTrigger`
 * (which carries `secret`) still gets only the ledger fields persisted.
