/**
 * Closing Time — the graceful, data-loss-free shutdown protocol.
 *
 * Killing the PTYs mid-thought loses whatever the agents were holding in
 * working memory: uncommitted WIP, unrecorded decisions, half-updated
 * memory.md files. "Closing time" closes the floor the way a real office
 * does: the human announces it, every worker packs up and confirms, the
 * manager locks the door.
 *
 *   1. The human clicks "closing time" in the quit dialog.
 *   2. We mail the god agent a shutdown brief: broadcast closing time to the
 *      team; every worker commits/parks WIP, appends state + next steps to
 *      its memory.md, then replies with subject CLOSING-TIME-ACK.
 *   3. The god waits for every ACK (the harness shows live progress by
 *      watching the same inbox traffic), saves its own memory, and sends a
 *      message with subject CLOSING-TIME-COMPLETE.
 *   4. The router observer spots that message → the app tears down and quits.
 *
 * Everything rides the existing hive rails: inbox delivery, the idle
 * inbox-wake nudge, and Stop-hook draining already guarantee the messages
 * get acted on. This module only injects the kickoff mail and watches the
 * routed traffic — it never types into terminals.
 *
 * Runs in the Electron main process.
