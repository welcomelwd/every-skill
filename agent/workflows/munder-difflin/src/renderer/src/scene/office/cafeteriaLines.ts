// The cast ARE Dunder Mifflin (see cast.ts), so an agent's coffee break is an
// excuse for a one-liner in character. Two kinds of line:
//   • solo  — one quip shown above a single agent at a break spot
//   • pair  — a two-beat exchange between two agents at the same table
//
// Lines are kept short so they fit the ThoughtBubble (≈MAX_WIDTH). Character
// keys match OfficeCharacterName; anyone without bespoke lines falls back to the
// shared GENERIC pool so the floor never feels empty.
