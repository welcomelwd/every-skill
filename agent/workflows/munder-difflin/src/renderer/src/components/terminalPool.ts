/**
 * A process-wide pool of live xterm terminals, one per ptyId.
 *
 * Why: node-pty keeps no scrollback. If we created/disposed an xterm every time
 * the user switched agents (or toggled fullscreen), the new terminal would be
 * empty and stay blank until the TUI happened to repaint — which is exactly the
 * "terminal vanishes until I drag the splitter" bug.
 *
 * Instead each pty gets ONE Terminal for the app's lifetime. It is opened into a
 * detached host <div> and subscribes to the pty stream once, so its buffer is
 * always populated. A view (the sidebar tab or the fullscreen overlay) simply
 * re-parents that host element into itself when it mounts and detaches it on
 * unmount — the rendered content moves with it, so the terminal is always
 * visible immediately, no repaint required.

 * Re-measure cell metrics and rebuild the viewport scroll-area for a pooled

 * xterm caches the cell height measured at open() and only recomputes it on a
 * font change or resize. When that cached metric goes stale (sleep/wake), the
 * .xterm-viewport scroll-area height (rows × cellHeight) is wrong, so only PART
 * of the still-intact buffer is scrollable — the user otherwise has to zoom to
 * force a fit() and reveal the rest.
 *
 * Mirrors the document.fonts.ready re-measure in PtyTerminalView: re-applying the
 * SAME font invalidates xterm's cached cell metrics, clearTextureAtlas re-rasters
 * the WebGL glyph atlas at the right size, then fit() recomputes cols/rows and
 * rebuilds the viewport. Preserves scroll position (NO scrollToBottom) so a user
 * reading history isn't yanked down. No-op until the terminal is opened and its
 * host has a real size, so it composes safely with multiple triggers firing
 * together (onContextLoss + visibilitychange + focus) — a cheap reflow twice is
 * harmless; the guards make an early/duplicate call a no-op.
