/**
 * Copy hygiene for terminal selections.
 *
 * Agent CLIs paint their decoration INTO the character grid. Claude Code draws
 * a markdown blockquote as `▎ text`, so the rail is a real cell on that line —
 * not a border drawn beside it. Selecting the line (which is exactly what a
 * triple-click or a full-width drag does) therefore copies the rail with the
 * prose, and the paste lands as:
 *
 *     ▎ Munder Difflin — clones for you and your team, working 24/7.
 *
 * Nothing downstream wants that glyph, so strip it on the way to the clipboard.
 *
 * The guard that stops this from eating real content: a rail only counts when a
 * space follows it or it ends the line — the shape a quote gutter always has. A
 * bar chart (`▌▌▌▌ 40%`) or block art keeps its bars because they run together.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. Only the left/right BLOCK elements CLIs use as a gutter
 * are in the set; box-drawing verticals (`│`, `┃`) are not. `tree`, `git log
 * --graph` and every framed table indent continuation lines with `│   `, and
 * stripping that would corrupt far more copies than it would fix.
