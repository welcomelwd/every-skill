# The message queue — how anything gets typed into an agent's terminal

Every agent runs a real CLI in a real PTY. That CLI has exactly one input line, and
you are not the only one who wants it: you type into the terminal directly, and the
harness also has messages of its own to deliver. This document is the contract for
who gets that line and when.

Two different queues get called "the queue". They are not the same thing:

| Name | Lives in | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| **MD queue** | the harness (zustand store, per agent) | messages parked by *Munder Difflin* until that agent's terminal is free |
| **Claude queue** | inside Claude Code itself | text Claude Code has accepted but not started on yet |

Everything below is about the **MD queue**. The harness cannot see the Claude queue
and never reasons about it.

---

## 1. One gate

One place types automatic messages into a live agent's PTY: the **drain loop**,
`useHive.ts` effect #4. Everything that wants to reach a running agent enqueues into
the MD queue and lets the drain decide when.

(The single exception is the god agent's boot sequence, `useHive.ts:284`, which
writes its remote-control command and orientation prompt directly. That PTY was
spawned milliseconds earlier and is covered by the boot-grace window, so there is no
user draft it could land on.)

```
composer / Slack ingress ─┐
inbox nudge (effect #3) ──┼──▶ enqueueMessage(agentId, text) ──▶ MD queue ──▶ drain (#4) ──▶ PTY
scheduled /compact (#6) ──┘
```

This is load-bearing. When the inbox nudge wrote straight into the terminal, it was
a second writer with its own idea of when the prompt was free — and its text landed
on top of a half-written line, so the nudge and the user's sentence were submitted
together as one garbled prompt. Routing it through the queue means one loop owns
every "is this terminal free?" decision, and the nudge needs no prompt logic of its
own.

The drain runs on every store change (debounced 200 ms, so a burst of PTY output
coalesces) plus a 3 s backstop tick.

## 2. What the drain checks

The front of an agent's MD queue is delivered only when **all** of these hold:

| Condition | Why |
|---|---|
| agent status is `idle` | don't interrupt a running turn |
| auto-delivery not paused — **or the message was manually released** | floor-wide switch (Command Center); see below |
| past the boot grace window | the CLI is still painting its banner |
| `isTerminalAutomationSafe(ptyId)` | the user owns the prompt — see below |
| 4.5 s since the last delivery to this agent | back-to-back sends jam the TUI |

**Manual release (v0.3.5).** While floor-wide auto-delivery is paused, every queued row
shows a **send now** link. Clicking it sets `manual: true` on that message and moves it
to the front of its queue. The drain then bypasses **only the pause check** for that
message — every other condition in this table still applies, so a manually released
message waits for idle, respects your draft/picker, and is acknowledged the same way.
The pause gate holds everything else untouched.

Delivery is acknowledged only after both PTY writes (the text, then the submit) have
succeeded. A failure leaves the message visible in the queue and it retries.

## 3. The user owns the prompt

`isTerminalAutomationSafe` is the gate that protects your typing. It refuses
delivery while any of these is true (`terminalAutomation.ts`):

| Block | Set by | Cleared by |
|---|---|---|
| `exited` | the PTY died | respawn |
| `picker` | you submitted a bare `/model`-style command that opens a menu | an Enter / Escape / Ctrl-C typed into that terminal, or expiry |
| `draft` | you have unsubmitted text on the prompt | submitting or clearing it, or expiry |
| `settling` | a short repaint window after the line was freed | time |

Both `picker` and `draft` expire after **30 minutes** (`STALE_PICKER_MS`,
`STALE_INPUT_MS`). The expiry exists because both flags are inferred, not reported —
a picker closed some way we can't observe, or a draft flag left set by a TUI that
swallowed keys, would otherwise wedge that agent's MD queue for the rest of the
session.

Two rules about what happens when a block expires:

- **Automation never erases your text.** Expiry means the queued message is typed
  *after* whatever is on the line; the two fuse into one prompt. An earlier version
  sent Ctrl-U first, which silently destroyed real drafts that had merely been left
  alone for a minute.
- **Automation never closes your menu.** We do not send Escape at a picker. You may
  have opened it deliberately and stepped away; taking it down to make room for a
  queued message is not the harness's call, and we cannot verify that Escape worked
  anyway. The composer has a button that does it — because then *you* asked.

Both windows are long on purpose. Treating a live draft as abandoned is the
expensive mistake; leaving a queued message parked a while longer is the cheap one.

## 4. Reading the prompt instead of modelling it

`inputDirty` is inferred by counting keystrokes in `term.onData`. That model drifts:
a TUI that eats keys for its own UI leaves the count above zero while the prompt is
visibly empty — a **phantom draft**, which blocks the MD queue against text that
does not exist.

xterm already holds the rendered screen, so `promptLineHasText` reads it directly
(`term.buffer.active`, the row at `baseY + cursorY`, stripped of prompt chrome).

It is deliberately **one-directional**: the buffer read can only *clear* a draft,
never invent one.

- screen says empty ⇒ believe it, drop the block
- screen says text, or cannot be read ⇒ fall back to the keystroke count

The asymmetry is the point, because the two mistakes don't cost the same. A wrong
"empty" opens the gate and fuses a queued message onto what you're writing. A wrong
"has text" only parks that message until the draft expires. So the cheap mistake is
the one we allow to happen.

One case where the screen is not evidence at all: `inputDirty` is set the moment you
press a key, but the character only reaches xterm's buffer after the PTY echoes it
back. Inside that gap the buffer is still showing the previous state, so a read of a
freshly started draft would return "empty" — the expensive direction. A read within
`ECHO_GRACE_MS` (1 s) of the last keystroke therefore returns "don't know" and clears
nothing.

## 5. Seeing why nothing is being delivered

A held MD queue used to look exactly like an idle agent with nothing to do. The
`typing` badge (`--cth-status-typing`, label **"your draft"**) fixes that: it renders
on agent cards and in the fullscreen roster whenever `hasTerminalDraft(ptyId)` is
true.

It is not an agent status and is never stored on the agent — the PTY parser owns
that field and would overwrite it. It is derived at render from the same draft
detection the gate uses, so the badge is reporting the same draft the gate sees.

It does **not** apply the 30-minute expiry the gate applies. Past that window the
gate starts delivering while the badge still reads "your draft" — which is honest:
your text really is still sitting on the prompt. The badge answers "is my text
there", not "is the queue blocked".

## 6. Where the code lives

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/renderer/src/components/terminalAutomation.ts` | pure policy — blocks, expiry windows. No DOM, fully unit-tested (`test/terminal-automation.test.cjs`) |
| `src/renderer/src/components/terminalPool.ts` | the pooled xterm per PTY; buffer reads, latches, `isTerminalAutomationSafe`, `hasTerminalDraft` |
| `src/renderer/src/hooks/useHive.ts` | effect #3 inbox nudge (enqueues), effect #4 drain (the one writer), effect #6 scheduled `/compact` |
| `src/renderer/src/store/store.ts` | the MD queues themselves + agent persistence |
