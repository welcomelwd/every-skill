# The Hive — autonomous multi-agent layer

This document is the design source of truth for the agent-collaboration layer. It
sits alongside [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) (terminal/event plane) and
[`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md) (visual system). Code is the source of truth for what's
*built*; this is the source of truth for what we're *building toward*.

## 1. What we're building (and what it's called)

Each spawned agent is a real `claude` CLI process with a filesystem, a system
prompt, and a hook lifecycle. We layer four classic patterns on top:

| Behaviour the user asked for | Pattern (the name) |
| --- | --- |
| Per-agent memory file made at spawn, that the agent reads and updates | **Agent long-term memory** (MemGPT/Letta-style self-managed memory) |
| Writing a requirement into another agent's file | **Stigmergy** — coordinating by modifying a shared environment |
| A shared plan multiple agents edit | **Blackboard architecture** (Hearsay-II) |
| "Check after finishing every task" | **Mailbox / actor model** — drain an inbox at a lifecycle point |
| A "god" agent that runs the floor and clarifies for others | **Orchestrator / supervisor** (LangGraph-supervisor-style) |

The umbrella term is a **multi-agent system (MAS)** with **autonomous agent
loops**. The closest academic analogue to this app is Stanford's *Generative
Agents* (Park et al., 2023): Sims-style avatars in a 2D world with a memory
stream, retrieval, reflection, and planning.

## 2. Locked design decisions

1. **Git as the coordination/audit layer, single committer.** Everything the
   hive knows is files in one local git repo. To avoid `.git/index.lock`
   corruption with many concurrent agents, **only the Electron main process
   commits**. Agents never call git — they write plain files. (Research:
   GitHub Desktop's commit-queue pattern; lazygit/git-retry backoff.)
2. **Single-writer-per-file.** Each agent writes only inside its own
   `agents/<id>/` directory. Cross-agent delivery happens by the **router**
   (main process) moving messages from a sender's `outbox/` into a recipient's
   `inbox/`. No file is ever written by two processes.
3. **God-mode autonomy, native HITL.** A privileged **god agent** (lives in
   Michael's room) adjudicates cross-agent traffic. Routine requests
   (clarifications, data asks, plan tweaks) it resolves itself and the system
   keeps running fully autonomously. **Critical** items (destructive ops, spend,
   scope changes, unresolvable conflicts) route to the god, who surfaces them to
   the human natively in his own Claude Code session — there is no separate
   approval queue. Tool-permission prompts are the HITL gate, and they're
   approvable remotely from a phone via `/remote-control`.
4. **Memory: markdown first.** Per-agent `memory.md` + shared blackboard, with a
   SQLite FTS index when keyword recall isn't enough. A heavyweight vector layer
   (Letta/Mem0/Zep) is *not* needed at 5–15 agents and is architecturally wrong
   here (they want to own the agent runtime; our runtime is the `claude` CLI).
   Optional future upgrade: **MemPalace over MCP** (validate its retrieval first —
   its public benchmarks are overstated per independent audit).
5. **Autonomous loop = `Stop` hook.** An agent that finishes drains its inbox via
   a `Stop` hook that returns `{"decision":"block","reason":…}` to keep it
   working, guarded by `stop_hook_active` to prevent infinite loops.

---

## 3. On-disk layout — the "hive"

Lives under `<harnessHome>/hive/`, a git repo committed only by the main process.

```
hive/
  PROTOCOL.md            # the agent-facing contract (how to remember + message)
  registry.json          # roster: every agent, role, capabilities, status, seat
  board.md               # shared blackboard / co-authored plans
  tasks.json             # task ledger (id, assignee, spec, status, result ref)
  log.jsonl              # append-only event feed (drives the UI activity stream)
  agents/<agentId>/
    identity.md          # who am I, my role, my capabilities  (read at start)
    memory.md            # my long-term memory  (I read at start, append as I learn)
    inbox/               # messages delivered TO me — <ts>-<msgid>.json
    inbox/.done/         # processed messages (kept for audit, not deleted)
    outbox/              # messages I want to SEND — router drains these
    cursor.json          # { lastProcessed: <msgid> }  — avoids reprocessing
```

Design rules that make this robust:
- **One JSON file per message**, written via temp-file + atomic `rename` — never
  a co-edited shared mailbox file (those conflict under git).
- **Append-only** `log.jsonl`; consumers track their own cursor.
- `board.md` is the one genuinely co-edited file — it goes through the god agent
  (single scribe) to avoid conflicts.

## 4. Message schema (FIPA-lite)

Borrow the one useful idea from FIPA-ACL/KQML — the **speech act** — and drop the
LISP syntax. Seven semantic fields:

```jsonc
{
  "id":            "2026-05-30T14-03-11-123Z-a1b2",  // unique, time-sortable
  "conversation":  "conv-7f3",                        // groups a thread
  "in_reply_to":   "<prev msgid> | null",
  "from":          "agent.researcher",
  "to":            "agent.coder | god | broadcast",
  "act":           "request | inform | propose | query | agree | refuse | done",
  "subject":       "short human-readable summary",
  "body":          "free text / markdown / structured payload",
  "hops":          3,            // ++ per reply; capped to kill ping-pong loops
  "requires_reply": true,        // only request/query/propose obligate a reply
  "needs_human":   false,        // router/god may flip this to escalate
  "created_at":    "ISO-8601"
}
```

Anti-livelock rules: only `request`/`query`/`propose` obligate a reply (pure
`inform`/`done` are terminal); every reply increments `hops`; past a hop cap the
god agent escalates instead of letting two agents loop forever; re-seeing a
processed `id` is a no-op (idempotent via cursor).

---

## 5. Control flow

```
agent B mid-task needs something from agent C
        │ writes  agents/B/outbox/<msg>.json   (act:request, to:C)
        ▼
┌─────────────────────── main process (the harness) ───────────────────────┐
│  Router watches every outbox/                                             │
│    → deliver to agents/C/inbox/   (to:"human" → routed to the god proxy;  │
│       the god surfaces critical calls natively in its own session)        │
│    → append to log.jsonl → git commit (single committer, retry+backoff)   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │ delivered to C's inbox
        ▼
agent C finishes its current turn → Stop hook fires
        │ hook POSTs to the hive socket; main process checks C's inbox
        │ unread messages?  → reply {"decision":"block","reason": <messages>}
        ▼
agent C keeps working: reads the messages, acts, replies via its own outbox
```

The same hook socket drives the avatars: `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` payloads move
an agent to the right station (replacing today's `mockEvents.ts` / PTY-scraping).

## 6. The god agent (orchestrator)

A fixed, always-on agent seated at `desk-ceo` (Michael's room), `character:
michael`, flagged `isGod`. It is an ordinary `claude` process — the *intelligence*
— while the main process is the *mechanism* (git, sockets, routing). It owns:

- **Roster & routing** (`registry.json`): who exists, their capabilities, status.
- **Adjudication**: read each outbound request; resolve routine ones itself
  (answer clarifications, route to the right specialist with a self-contained
  task spec), escalate only critical ones. This is "god mode."
- **Blackboard scribe**: the single writer of `board.md`, so shared plans never
  conflict.
- **Task ledger** (`tasks.json`): assign, track, retry, checkpoint.

Its escalation policy (what counts as "critical") lives in its system prompt and
is the primary control surface — tune the prompt, not the code.

---

## 7. Phased plan

- **Phase 0 — Foundation** ✅: `hive.ts` on-disk layer + spawn injection
  (identity, protocol, env) + IPC to read hive state. Agents are hive-aware: they
  read their memory/inbox at task start and send via outbox; the router delivers;
  everything is committed and visible.
- **Phase 1 — Autonomy** ✅: `hooks.ts` UDS server + `cth-hook` shim (attached per
  agent via `--settings`) + `Stop`-loop so agents drain their inbox automatically
  and keep running (guarded by `stop_hook_active` + cursor); hook events stream to
  the renderer to drive avatars.
- **Phase 2 — God mode** ✅: the god agent auto-spawns into Michael's room
  (`desk-ceo` reserved) and, on a fresh spawn, is started with `/remote-control`
  (best-effort) plus an orientation prompt so it begins running the floor on its
  own. The router routes `to:"human"` traffic to the god (the human's proxy);
  there is no separate approval queue — human-in-the-loop is native to each
  agent's Claude Code session (permission prompts, approvable remotely from a
  phone). Idle agents are woken when they hold unread inbox messages.
- **Phase 3 — Semantic memory** ✅ (CLI integration): `memory.ts` wraps the
  **MemPalace CLI** (not MCP, by decision). The harness keeps one shared palace
  under `harnessHome`, points every agent's `MEMPALACE_PALACE_PATH` at it, mines
  each agent's `memory.md` into its own wing (mtime-gated), and agents recall via
  `mempalace search` / `wake-up`. Detect-and-degrade: a no-op when `mempalace`
  isn't installed (markdown memory still works). Default model `minilm` (light,
  for low-RAM Macs); `embeddinggemma` is the multilingual opt-in. A `MemoryPanel`
  lets the human search the same palace.
  - *Still open*: reflection/summarization to bound `memory.md`; needs a live
    `mempalace` install to validate retrieval end-to-end.

## 8. Key risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| `index.lock` corruption | Single committer (main process), retry+backoff, stale-lock cleanup |
| Infinite Stop-hook loop | Guard on `stop_hook_active`; `hops` cap; `CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP` |
| Two agents ping-ponging | Only request/query/propose obligate replies; hop cap → god escalates |
| Reprocessing messages | Per-agent `cursor.json`; processed messages move to `inbox/.done/` |
| `memory.md` unbounded growth | Phase 3 reflection/summarization |
| Modifying the user's repo with hooks | Write hooks to `<cwd>/.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored convention) |
