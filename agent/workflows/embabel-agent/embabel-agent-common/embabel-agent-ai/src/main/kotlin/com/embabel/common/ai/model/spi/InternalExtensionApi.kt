/**
 * Marks APIs that are internal extension mechanisms for LlmOptions.
 *
 * These APIs are intended for use by provider-specific modules
 * (e.g., embabel-agent-anthropic) to add provider-specific
 * configuration without coupling the core LlmOptions to specific providers.
 *
 * Application code should use provider-specific extension functions instead
 * (e.g., withAnthropicCaching() from the Anthropic module).
 *
 * Use with caution as these APIs may change without notice.
