/**
 * Concurrently attempts each candidate [ByokFactory] and returns the first service of type [T]
 * that validates successfully. Remaining tasks are cancelled on first success.
 *
 * Typical usage — sign-up flow (fan-out across all supported BYOK providers):
 * ```kotlin
 * val service = detectProvider(
 *     AnthropicModelFactory(apiKey = userKey),
 *     OpenAiCompatibleModelFactory.openAi(userKey),
 *     OpenAiCompatibleModelFactory.deepSeek(userKey),
 *     OpenAiCompatibleModelFactory.mistral(userKey),
 *     OpenAiCompatibleModelFactory.gemini(userKey),
 * )
 * val detectedProvider = service.provider
 * ```
 *
 * Typical usage — settings flow (single known provider):
 * ```kotlin
 * val service = detectProvider(AnthropicModelFactory(apiKey = userKey))
 * ```
 *
 * Racing is only sound when any candidate that accepts the key is an acceptable answer. That
 * holds for chat models, which are stateless per call. It does not hold for embedding models:
 * the vector index is built at a fixed dimension, so which provider replies first must not be
 * allowed to decide it. Build an embedding service from an explicitly chosen model instead of
 * racing candidates here.
 *
 * @param candidates One or more [ByokFactory] instances to race.
 * @return The service returned by the first successful factory.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if no candidates are supplied.
 * @throws InvalidApiKeyException if all candidates fail validation.
