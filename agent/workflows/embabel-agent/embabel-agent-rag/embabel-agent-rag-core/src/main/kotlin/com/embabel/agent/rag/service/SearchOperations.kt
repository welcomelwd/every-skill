     * - `+machine +learning` - both terms required (AND)
     * - `"machine learning"` - exact phrase match

     * ## Modifiers
     * - `+term` - term must appear
     * - `-term` - term must not appear
     * - `term*` - prefix wildcard
     * - `term~` - fuzzy match (edit distance)
     * - `term~0.8` - fuzzy match with similarity threshold

     * ## Query Field Examples
     * ```
     * // Find chunks mentioning either kotlin or java
     * "kotlin java"
     *
     * // Find chunks with both "error" and "handling"
