/**
 * Thin context for the `embabel.action` span: wraps the owning [AgentProcess] and the [Action].
 *
 * [statusCode] is set after the action runs and read by the convention at stop — the only mutable
 * field, since the outcome status is not known when the span opens. No cross-thread synchronization
 * is needed: `observe{}` is synchronous, so it is written and then read on the same thread, with a
 * happens-before from program order.
