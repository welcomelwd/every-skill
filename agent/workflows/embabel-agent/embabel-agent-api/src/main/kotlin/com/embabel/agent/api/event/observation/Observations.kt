     *
     * No explicit no-op short-circuit is needed: [Observation.createNotStarted] already fast-returns
     * a no-op observation for a no-op [registry] without invoking the [context] supplier, so the
     * disabled-tracing path builds no context and runs [work] directly.

     * The span name is not supplied here: the registered convention names it from [context] (see

     * Returns exactly what [work] returns, including `null`: [Observation.observe] is a transparent
     * wrapper that hands back `work()`'s own value, so this helper is safe for both nullable and
     * non-null [T]. The unchecked cast (rather than a `!!`) preserves a legitimate null result
     * instead of crashing on it.
