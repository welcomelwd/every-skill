/**
 * Annotation to indicate a method implementing an Action.
 * Methods can have any number of parameters, which represent
 * necessary input types.
 * Methods can return any type. The return type will become
 * an effect.
 * @param description Description of the action. Less important than for
 * goals as a planner chooses actions based on preconditions
 * and effects rather than by description. The description property is
 * used for documentation purposes, having the advantage over comments
 * that it can appear in logs. Description defaults to name
 * @param pre Preconditions for the action
 * @param post Postconditions for the action
 * @param canRerun can we rerun this action?
 * If false, the action will not be rerun if it has already run in the current process
 * @param readOnly Does this action have no external side effects?
 * Read-only actions only analyze data and produce derived objects without modifying
 * external systems (APIs, databases, files, etc.). Used for learning/catchup modes
 * where we want to ingest and understand data without triggering mutations.
 * @param clearBlackboard If true, all previous state will be cleared from the blackboard,
 * leaving only the outputs of this action.
 * @param outputBinding Output binding for the action.
 * Only required for a custom binding: a specific variable name for the returned value.
 * @param cost Static cost of executing the action. Ignored if [costMethod] is specified.
 * @param value Static value of performing the action. Ignored if [valueMethod] is specified.
 * @param costMethod Name of a @Cost method to compute dynamic cost at planning time.
 * When specified, overrides the static [cost] field.
 * @param valueMethod Name of a @Cost method to compute dynamic value at planning time.
 * When specified, overrides the static [value] field.
 * @Tool methods on the @Agentic class are automatically added.
 * @param trigger The type that must be the last result on the blackboard for this action to fire.
 * This enables reactive behavior where an action only fires when a specific type
 * is freshly added, even when multiple parameters of various types are available.
 * Defaults to Unit::class (no trigger). A trigger is an **additional** precondition: it
 * must be satisfied in addition to any preconditions listed in [pre] and the action method's input parameters.
 * @param actionRetryPolicy {@link com.embabel.agent.core.ActionRetryPolicy} for how to manage retries for this action.
 * Use actionRetryPolicyExpression
 * to specify specific properties.
 * @param actionRetryPolicyExpression An expression pointing to a set of properties for how to manage retries for this
 * action overriding these (these are the defaults if you do not specify):
 *   max-attempts: int = 5
 *   backoff-millis: long = 10000
 *   backoff-multiplier: double = 5.0
 *   backoff-maxInterval: long = 60000
 *   idempotent: boolean = false
 * example: ${agent.action-retry.default}
 * These take precedence over specifying the default in the Agent annotation.
