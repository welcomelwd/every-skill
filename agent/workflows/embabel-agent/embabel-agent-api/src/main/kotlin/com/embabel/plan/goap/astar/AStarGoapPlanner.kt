/**
 * Implements a Goal-Oriented Action Planning system using the A* algorithm.
 * A* works by finding the optimal sequence of actions to transform an initial state into a goal state
 * while minimizing total cost.
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
 *
 * The algorithm works as follows:
 * 1. Start with the initial world state
 * 2. Maintain an open list (priority queue) of states to explore, prioritized by f-score
 * 3. For each state, explore all achievable actions, calculating:
 *    - g-score: The cost accumulated so far to reach this state
 *    - h-score: A heuristic estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal
 *    - f-score: g-score + h-score (total estimated cost)
 * 4. Always expand the state with the lowest f-score first
 * 5. Track visited states and their best known costs to avoid cycles and redundant exploration
 * 6. Continue until finding a state that satisfies the goal conditions
 *
 * The implementation ensures finding the optimal (lowest cost) sequence of actions
 * by properly tracking path costs and using an admissible heuristic function.
