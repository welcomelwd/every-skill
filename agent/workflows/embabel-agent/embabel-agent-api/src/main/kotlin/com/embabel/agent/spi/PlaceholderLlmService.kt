package com.embabel.agent.spi

/**
 * Marks an [LlmService] that stands in for a model this deployment does not yet have a key for.
 *
 * A placeholder completes nothing. Its only job is to give the platform something to resolve
 * before any key is supplied, so that "no key yet" surfaces as an actionable error at the call
 * that needed an LLM rather than as a failure to start.
 *
 * The platform treats the presence of a placeholder as the deployment's own statement that keys
 * arrive at runtime, and relaxes exactly one thing on the strength of it: model names in
 * configuration that nothing has registered are expected rather than fatal. Every other
 * deployment keeps failing fast on a name it cannot resolve, because there a name that resolves
 * to nothing is a typo.
 *
 * Implemented by `SetupRequiredLlm` in `embabel-agent-byok-autoconfigure`. It lives here, next to
 * [LlmService], because `com.embabel.common.ai.model.ConfigurableModelProvider` has to recognise
 * a placeholder without depending on the BYOK module - carrying the placeholder without dragging
 * in that module is the reason the module exists.
