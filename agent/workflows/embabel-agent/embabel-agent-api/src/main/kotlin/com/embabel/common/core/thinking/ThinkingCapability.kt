/**
 * Marker interface for thinking capabilities.
 *
 * This is a tag interface that indicates a prompt runner implementation
 * supports thinking extraction and processing. Similar to StreamingCapability,
 * it enables polymorphic capability detection without defining specific methods.
 *
 * Implementations that extend this interface can extract thinking blocks
 * (like `<think>...</think>`) from LLM responses and provide thinking-aware
 * operations that return ThinkingResponse<T> objects.
 *
 * Note: Thinking and streaming capabilities are mutually exclusive.
 * StreamingPromptRunner implementations should not extend this interface.
 *
