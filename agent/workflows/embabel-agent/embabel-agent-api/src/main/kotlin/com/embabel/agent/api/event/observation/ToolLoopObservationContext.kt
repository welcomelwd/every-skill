/**
 * Thin context for the `embabel.tool_loop` span: wraps the [ToolLoopStartEvent] and the
 * [inputMessages] (the prompt, captured at start). [output] is set after the loop runs and read by
 * the convention at stop — the only mutable field, since the result is not on the start event.
 *
 * No cross-thread synchronization is needed: `observe{}` is synchronous, so [output] is written and
 * then read (by the convention at stop) on the same thread, with a happens-before from program order.
