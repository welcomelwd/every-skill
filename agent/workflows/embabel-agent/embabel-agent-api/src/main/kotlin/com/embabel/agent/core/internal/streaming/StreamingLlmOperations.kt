/**
 * Streaming extension of LlmOperations for real-time LLM response processing.
 *
 * This internal interface provides reactive streaming capabilities that support
 * the API layer StreamingPromptRunner interfaces, enabling:
 * - Real-time processing of LLM responses as they arrive
 * - Streaming lists of objects from JSONL responses
 * - Mixed content streams with both objects and LLM reasoning (thinking)
 * - Progressive agent progress monitoring
 *
 * All streaming methods return Project Reactor Flux streams for integration
 * with Spring WebFlux and other reactive frameworks.
