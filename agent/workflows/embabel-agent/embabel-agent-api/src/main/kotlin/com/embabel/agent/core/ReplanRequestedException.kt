/**
 * Exception thrown by a tool to signal that the tool loop should terminate
 * and the agent should replan based on the updated blackboard state.
 *
 * This enables tools to influence agent behavior at a higher level than just
 * returning results. Use cases include:
 * - Chat routing: A routing tool classifies user intent and requests replan
 *   to switch to the appropriate handler action
 * - Discovery: A tool discovers that the current approach won't work and
 *   the agent should try a different plan
 * - State changes: A tool detects significant state changes that require
 *   the agent to reassess its goals
 *
 * When caught by the tool loop:
 * 1. The loop terminates gracefully (no error)
 * 2. [blackboardUpdater] is made available for the caller to apply
 * 3. The caller (typically action executor) can trigger GOAP replanning
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * @LlmTool(description = "Routes user to appropriate handler")
 * fun routeUser(message: String): String {
 *     val intent = classifyIntent(message)
 *     throw ReplanRequestedException(
 *         reason = "Classified as $intent request",
 *         blackboardUpdater = { bb -> bb.addObject(intent) }
 *     )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param reason Human-readable explanation of why replan is needed
 * @param blackboardUpdater Callback to update the blackboard before replanning
