/**
 * Tag interface that marks streaming capability support.
 *
 * This interface serves as a marker for objects that provide streaming operations,
 * enabling polymorphic access to streaming functionality without creating circular
 * dependencies between API packages.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface provide reactive streaming capabilities that
 * allow for real-time processing of LLM responses as they arrive, supporting:
 * - Progressive text generation
 * - Streaming object creation from JSONL responses
 * - Mixed content streams with both objects and LLM reasoning (thinking)
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val runner: PromptRunner = context.ai().autoLlm()
 * if (runner.supportsStreaming()) {
 *     val capability: StreamingCapability = runner.streaming()
 *     val operations = capability as StreamingPromptRunner.Streaming (or use asStreaming extension function)
 *     // Use streaming operations...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This interface follows the explicit failure policy - streaming operations
 * will throw exceptions if called on non-streaming implementations rather
 * than providing fallback behavior.
 *
