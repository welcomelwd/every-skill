 * Emitted once per individual LLM invocation (per-call, not per-loop).
 *
 * Survives CONCURRENT mode and validation/binding retries — each effective LLM call
 * produces exactly one event. Listener exceptions are isolated by the underlying
 * `notifyAfterLlmCall` try/catch, so a misbehaving listener cannot break the tool loop.
 *
 * In CONCURRENT mode, this event may be emitted from multiple threads simultaneously.
 * Stateful listeners (cost aggregation, rate caps, etc.) MUST use thread-safe structures.
