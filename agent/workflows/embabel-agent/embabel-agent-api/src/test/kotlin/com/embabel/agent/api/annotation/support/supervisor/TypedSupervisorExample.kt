/**
 * A typed supervisor example demonstrating schema-informed flexible composition.
 *
 * Key differences from GOAP:
 * - Actions don't declare preconditions/effects
 * - The supervisor LLM sees TYPE SCHEMAS and decides composition at runtime
 * - Results are still TYPED and validated, but ordering is flexible
 *
 * Using wrapper request types (e.g., MarketDataRequest) enables these actions
 * to work with any planner - GOAP, Supervisor, or others.
 *
 * The LLM sees something like:
 * ```
 * Available actions:
 * - gatherMarketData(request: MarketDataRequest) -> MarketData
 *     Schema: { revenues: Map, marketShare: Map, growthRates: Map }
 * - analyzeCompetitors(request: CompetitorAnalysisRequest) -> CompetitorAnalysis
 *     Schema: { strengths: Map, weaknesses: Map, positioning: Map }
 * - forecastTrends(request: TrendForecastRequest) -> TrendForecast
 * - writeSection(request: WriteSectionRequest) -> ProseSection
 *
 * Current artifacts on blackboard:
 * - MarketData: { revenues: {AWS: "$90B", ...}, marketShare: {...} }
 * - CompetitorAnalysis: { strengths: {AWS: ["market leader"], ...} }
 *
 * Goal: FinalReport
 * ```
 *
 * The supervisor decides: "I have market data and competitor analysis.
 * I should forecast trends next, then write sections, then compile the report."
 *
 * This is TYPED but FLEXIBLE - the LLM understands schemas without being
 * constrained by declared dependencies.
