/**
 * Holds the shipped catalog against the real OpenAI API.
 *
 * The unit tests prove the catalog is *read* as written; nothing until here proves it describes
 * models that exist. That gap is how `*-pro` shipped broken — declared, never called, build green.
 * Every entry added since carries the same risk, so the claims a catalog entry makes are checked
 * against the provider: that the id resolves, that the declared transport works, and that the
 * transport still works once the request carries tools.
 *
 * The parameter lists are derived from the catalog rather than written out, so a model added to
 * the YAML is covered without anyone remembering to add it here. A hand-written list is the same
 * mechanism as no list at all: `gpt-5.6-luna` was in one, and its tool calling was still broken.
