 * [com.embabel.common.ai.model.ConfigurableModelProvider] cannot resolve `embabel.models.default-llm`
 * and the context never refreshes. Registering this placeholder and pointing `default-llm` at it
 * gives the platform something to resolve, deferring the "no key" failure from startup to the
 * first call that actually needs an LLM.
 *
 * Opt in by putting `embabel-agent-starter-byok` on the classpath and configuring:
 * ```yaml
 * embabel:
 *   models:
 *     default-llm: setup-required

 * [com.embabel.agent.api.common.PromptRunner.withLlmService].
