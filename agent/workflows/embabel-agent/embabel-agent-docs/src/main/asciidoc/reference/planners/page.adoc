=== Choosing a Planner

Embabel supports multiple planning strategies.
Most are deterministic, but their behaviour differs--although it is always predictable.

All planning strategies are entirely typesafe in Java or Kotlin.

The planning strategies currently supported out of the box are:

[cols="1,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Planner |Best For |Description

|*GOAP* (default)
|Business processes with defined outputs
|Goal-oriented, deterministic planning. Plans a path from current state to goal using preconditions and effects.

|*Utility*
|Exploration and event-driven systems
|Selects the highest-value available action at each step. Ideal when you don't know the outcome upfront.

|*Hybrid*
|Reducer pipelines (gather many context-producing actions, run one synthesizer, stop)
|Like Utility for action picking, but exits as soon as any registered goal is already satisfied. Pair an unsatisfiable goal (e.g. `NIRVANA`) with a real terminal goal: opportunistic research fires while research is profitable; the process completes the moment the real goal is reached.

|*Supervisor*
|Flexible multi-step workflows
|LLM-orchestrated composition. An LLM selects which actions to call based on type schemas and gathered artifacts.
|===

As most of the documentation covers GOAP, this section discusses the alternative planners and nested workflows.

[[reference.planners__utility]]
==== Utility AI

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_system[Utility AI] selects the action with the highest _net value_ from all available actions at each step.
Unlike GOAP, which plans a path to a goal, Utility AI makes greedy decisions based on immediate value.

Utility AI excels in *exploratory scenarios* where you don't know exactly what you want to achieve.
Consider a GitHub issue triage system: when a new issue arrives, you don't have a predetermined goal.
Instead, you want to react appropriately based on the issue's characteristics--maybe label it, maybe respond, maybe escalate.
The "right" action depends on what you discover as you process it.

This makes Utility AI ideal for scenarios where:

* There is no clear end goal--you're exploring possibilities
* Multiple actions could be valuable depending on context
* You want to respond to changing conditions as they emerge
* The best outcome isn't known upfront

===== When to Use Utility AI

* *Event-driven systems*: React to incoming events (issues, stars, webhooks) with the most appropriate action
* *Chatbots*: Where the platform provides multiple response options and selects the best one
* *Exploration*: When you want to discover what's possible rather than achieve a specific goal

===== Using Utility AI with `@EmbabelComponent`

For Utility AI, actions are typically provided via `@EmbabelComponent` rather than `@Agent`.
This allows the _platform_ to select actions across multiple components based on utility, rather than constraining actions to a single agent.

Here's an example from the Shepherd project that reacts to GitHub events:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
@EmbabelComponent  // <1>
public class IssueActions {

    private final ShepherdProperties properties;
    private final CommunityDataManager communityDataManager;
    private final GitHubUpdater gitHubUpdater;

    public IssueActions(ShepherdProperties properties,
                        CommunityDataManager communityDataManager,
                        GitHubUpdater gitHubUpdater) {
        this.properties = properties;
        this.communityDataManager = communityDataManager;
        this.gitHubUpdater = gitHubUpdater;
    }

    @Action(outputBinding = "ghIssue")  // <2>
    public GHIssue saveNewIssue(GHIssue ghIssue, OperationContext context) {
        var existing = communityDataManager.findIssueByGithubId(ghIssue.getId());
        if (existing == null) {
            var issueEntityStatus = communityDataManager.saveAndExpandIssue(ghIssue);
            context.add(issueEntityStatus);  // <3>
            return ghIssue;
        }
        return null;  // <4>
    }

    @Action(
        pre = {"spel:newEntity.newEntities.?[#this instanceof T(com.embabel.shepherd.domain.Issue)].size() > 0"}  // <5>
    )
    public IssueAssessment reactToNewIssue(GHIssue ghIssue, NewEntity<?> newEntity, Ai ai) {
        return ai
            .withLlm(properties.getTriageLlm())
            .creating(IssueAssessment.class)
            .fromTemplate("first_issue_response", Map.of("issue", ghIssue));  // <6>
    }

    @Action(pre = {"spel:issueAssessment.urgency > 0.0"})  // <7>
    public void heavyHitterIssue(GHIssue issue, IssueAssessment issueAssessment) {
        // Take action on high-urgency issues
    }
}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin]
----
@EmbabelComponent  // <1>
class IssueActions(
    val properties: ShepherdProperties,
    private val communityDataManager: CommunityDataManager,
    private val gitHubUpdater: GitHubUpdater,
) {

    @Action(outputBinding = "ghIssue")  // <2>
    fun saveNewIssue(ghIssue: GHIssue, context: OperationContext): GHIssue? {
        val existing = communityDataManager.findIssueByGithubId(ghIssue.id)
        if (existing == null) {
            val issueEntityStatus = communityDataManager.saveAndExpandIssue(ghIssue)
            context += issueEntityStatus  // <3>
            return ghIssue
        }
        return null  // <4>
    }

    @Action(
        pre = ["spel:newEntity.newEntities.?[#this instanceof T(com.embabel.shepherd.domain.Issue)].size() > 0"]  // <5>
    )
    fun reactToNewIssue(
        ghIssue: GHIssue,
        newEntity: NewEntity<*>,
        ai: Ai
    ): IssueAssessment {
        return ai
            .withLlm(properties.triageLlm)
            .creating(IssueAssessment::class.java)
            .fromTemplate("first_issue_response", mapOf("issue" to ghIssue))  // <6>
    }

    @Action(pre = ["spel:issueAssessment.urgency > 0.0"])  // <7>
    fun heavyHitterIssue(issue: GHIssue, issueAssessment: IssueAssessment) {
        // Take action on high-urgency issues
    }
}
----
====

<1> `@EmbabelComponent` contributes actions to the platform, not a specific agent
<2> `outputBinding` names the result for later actions to reference
<3> Add entity status to context, making it available to subsequent actions
<4> Returning `null` prevents further actions from firing for this issue
<5> SpEL precondition: only fire if new issues were created
<6> Use AI to assess the issue via a template
<7> This action only fires if the assessment shows urgency > 0

The platform selects which action to run based on:

1. Which preconditions are satisfied (type availability + SpEL conditions)
2. The `cost` and `value` parameters on `@Action` (net value = value - cost)

===== Action Cost and Value

The `@Action` annotation supports `cost` and `value` parameters (both 0.0 to 1.0):

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
@Action(
    cost = 0.1,   // <1>
    value = 0.8   // <2>
)
public Output highValueAction(Input input) {
    // Action implementation
}
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin]
----
@Action(
    cost = 0.1,   // <1>
    value = 0.8   // <2>
)
fun highValueAction(input: Input): Output {
    // Action implementation
}
----
====

<1> Cost to execute (0.0 to 1.0) - lower is cheaper
<2> Value when executed (0.0 to 1.0) - higher is more valuable

The Utility planner calculates _net value_ as `value - cost` and selects the action with the highest net value from all available actions.

===== The Nirvana Goal

Utility AI supports a special "Nirvana" goal that is never satisfied.
This keeps the process running, continuously selecting the highest-value available action until no actions are available.

===== Extensibility

Utility AI fosters extensibility.
For example, multiple groups within an organization can contribute their own `@EmbabelComponent` classes with actions that bring their own expertise to enhance behaviours around shared types, while retaining the ability to own and control their own extended model.

===== Utility and States

Utility AI can combine with the `@State` annotation to implement classification and routing patterns.
This is particularly useful when you need to:

* *Classify input* into different categories at runtime
* *Route processing* through category-specific handlers
* *Achieve different goals* based on classification

The key pattern is:

1. An entry action classifies input and returns a `@State` type
2. Each `@State` class contains an `@AchievesGoal` action that produces the final output
3. The `@AchievesGoal` output is _not_ a `@State` type (to prevent infinite loops)

Here's an example of a ticket triage system that routes support tickets based on severity:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
@Agent(
    description = "Triage and process support tickets",
    planner = PlannerType.UTILITY  // <1>

    public record Ticket(String id, String description, String customerId) {}
    public record ResolvedTicket(String id, String resolution, String handledBy) {}

    @State
    public sealed interface TicketCategory permits CriticalTicket, BugTicket, GeneralTicket {}  // <2>

    @Action
    public TicketCategory triageTicket(Ticket ticket) {  // <3>
        if (ticket.description().toLowerCase().contains("down")) {
            return new CriticalTicket(ticket);
        } else if (ticket.description().toLowerCase().contains("bug")) {
            return new BugTicket(ticket);
        } else {
            return new GeneralTicket(ticket);
        }
    }

    @State
    public record CriticalTicket(Ticket ticket) implements TicketCategory {
        @AchievesGoal(description = "Handle critical ticket with immediate escalation")  // <4>
        @Action

            );
        }

                "ENGINEERING_TEAM"
            );

----
====

<1> Use `PlannerType.UTILITY` for opportunistic action selection
<2> Sealed interface as the state supertype
<3> Entry action classifies and returns a `@State` instance
<4> Each state has an `@AchievesGoal` action producing the final output

When a `Ticket` is processed:

1. The `triageTicket` action classifies it into one of the state types
2. Entering a state clears other objects from the blackboard
3. The Utility planner selects the `@AchievesGoal` action for that state
4. The goal is achieved when `ResolvedTicket` is produced

This pattern works well when:

* Classification determines the processing path
* Each category has distinct handling requirements
* The final output type is the same across all categories

===== UtilityInvocation: Lightweight Utility Pattern

For simple utility workflows, you don't need to create an `@Agent` class.
`UtilityInvocation` provides a fluent API to run utility-based workflows directly from `@EmbabelComponent` actions.

[[reference.planners__hybrid]]
==== Hybrid

The Hybrid planner combines Utility AI's value-based action picking with goal-satisfaction termination — the "iterate then stop" mode. It exists for reducer-style pipelines where:

* You want to fire many opportunistic, context-producing actions (research lookups, KG queries, enrichment passes) in netValue order — like Utility AI.
* You then want a single synthesising action to run, producing a terminal result.
* You want the process to *stop* the moment that terminal result is on the blackboard, rather than continuing to fire low-value or negative-value leftover actions.

===== Why a Separate Planner

GOAP minimises path cost to the goal; it skips opportunistic actions that aren't on the cheapest plan, so research never fires. Pure Utility AI is greedy single-step; when paired with a satisfiable terminal goal it gives up at step 1 if no single action reaches the goal. Pure Utility AI paired with `NIRVANA` iterates beautifully but never terminates — it keeps picking actions even after your real goal is satisfied, burning compute on the way to nowhere.

Hybrid is the missing middle. It picks the highest-netValue achievable action each tick (so research happens) *and* checks "is the goal already satisfied?" **before** selecting an action (so termination is clean once a real goal is reached).

===== The Two-Goal Pattern

The hybrid planner is designed to be used with *two* goals on the same agent:

1. The *real terminal goal* — what success looks like (e.g. `attention-candidate-produced`, `report-generated`).
2. `com.embabel.agent.core.support.NIRVANA` — the framework's pre-built unsatisfiable goal, which keeps Utility-style action picking alive while research is still profitable.

At each tick the planner generates one plan per goal. NIRVANA returns the highest-netValue achievable action as a 1-step plan. The real goal returns:

* An *empty plan* (`netValue = 0`) if the goal is already satisfied — beats NIRVANA's then-only-negative-value leftovers.
* A 1-step plan if a single action reaches the goal.
* `null` otherwise.

The host process picks the highest-net-value plan across goals. While research is profitable, NIRVANA's plan wins. The moment the real goal is satisfied, its empty plan wins and `plan.isComplete()` fires, terminating the process.

===== When to Use Hybrid

* *Per-signal triage pipelines* that gather multiple context sources before a final assessment LLM call.
* *Research-then-synthesise* workflows where multiple actions contribute typed artifacts to a blackboard, and one final action consumes everything.
* *Pack-extensible reducers* where new opportunistic actions can be added without rewriting the synthesis step — their value alone gets them scheduled.

Use Utility AI without Hybrid when you genuinely want a long-running event loop with no terminal goal (chat surfaces, exploratory triage).

Use GOAP when you have strict typed-dependency ordering and don't need opportunistic research.

===== Tuning Values

For the hybrid pattern to work as intended:

* *Research actions* (the opportunistic context producers) should have *high net value* so they win the picker race while their `canRerun=false` slot is still open.
* *The synthesiser* (the final action that produces the terminal output) should have *positive but lower net value*. It wins after research is locked out.
* *Wrap-up actions* (those that lift a verdict into the goal output) should have *value just above the synthesiser* so they fire immediately after.

Once the wrap-up writes the terminal artifact, the real goal's empty plan wins and the process exits — regardless of any remaining negative-value actions.

<1> `NIRVANA` keeps the iterate-by-netValue picking alive across multiple ticks; without it, the planner gives up at step 1 if no single action reaches the real goal.
<2> The real terminal goal — what makes the process stop. Returns an empty plan once satisfied.
<3> Per-process opt-in via `ProcessOptions`. The default (`GOAP`) is unchanged for other processes.

===== Difference from `UTILITY`

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Scenario |`UTILITY` |`HYBRID`

|Real goal satisfied, no actions achievable
|Empty plan (terminate)
|Empty plan (terminate)

|Real goal satisfied, other actions still achievable
|Picks highest-netValue action and runs it
|Empty plan (terminate) — *the load-bearing fix*

|Real goal not satisfied, action reaches it in 1 step
|1-step plan
|1-step plan

|Real goal not satisfied, no 1-step path
|`null` (planner gives up)
|`null` (planner gives up — paired NIRVANA handles iteration)

|`NIRVANA` goal
|Highest-netValue achievable action; `null` when nothing's available
|Identical to `UTILITY` semantics
|===

`HYBRID` is `UTILITY` with one extra check: *if the real goal is already satisfied, return an empty plan regardless of what actions remain achievable.* This is what enables clean termination of the two-goal pattern.

[[reference.planners__supervisor]]
==== Supervisor

The Supervisor planner uses an LLM to orchestrate actions dynamically.
This is a popular pattern in frameworks like https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#supervisor[LangGraph] and https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/multi-agents/#supervisor-agent-sample[Google ADK], where a supervisor LLM decides which tools to call and in what order.

[NOTE]
====
Unlike GOAP and Utility, the Supervisor planner is *non-deterministic*.
The LLM may choose different action sequences for the same inputs.
This makes it less suitable for business-critical workflows requiring reproducibility.
====

===== Type-Informed vs Type-Driven

A key design decision in supervisor architectures is how types relate to composition:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Approach |Description

|*Type-Driven* (GOAP)
|Types _constrain_ composition. An action requiring `MarketData` can only run after an action produces `MarketData`. This is deterministic but rigid.

|*Type-Informed* (Supervisor)
|Types _inform_ composition. The LLM sees type schemas and decides what to call based on semantic understanding. This is flexible but non-deterministic.
|===

Embabel's Supervisor planner takes the *type-informed* approach while maximizing the benefits of types:

* Actions return *typed outputs* that are validated
* The LLM sees *type schemas* to understand what each action produces
* Results are stored on the *typed blackboard* for later actions
* The same actions work with *any planner* (GOAP, Utility, or Supervisor)

This is a "typed supervisor" pattern--a middle ground between fully type-driven (GOAP) and untyped string-passing (typical LangGraph).

===== When to Use Supervisor

Supervisor is appropriate when:

* Action ordering is *context-dependent* and hard to predefine
* You want an LLM to *synthesize information* across multiple sources
* The workflow benefits from *flexible composition* rather than strict sequencing
* Non-determinism is acceptable for your use case

Supervisor is *not* recommended when:

* You need *reproducible*, auditable execution paths
* Actions have strict *dependency ordering* that must be enforced
* Latency and cost matter (each decision requires an LLM call)

===== Using Supervisor

To use Supervisor, annotate your agent with `planner = PlannerType.SUPERVISOR` and mark one action with `@AchievesGoal`:

<1> Tool actions have descriptions visible to the supervisor LLM
<2> The goal action is called when the supervisor has gathered enough information

The supervisor LLM sees type schemas for available actions:

[source]
----
Available actions:
- gatherMarketData(request: MarketDataRequest) -> MarketData
    Schema: { revenues: Map, marketShare: Map }
- analyzeCompetitors(request: CompetitorAnalysisRequest) -> CompetitorAnalysis
    Schema: { strengths: Map }

Current artifacts on blackboard:
- MarketData: { revenues: {"CompanyA": "$10B"}, marketShare: {...} }

Goal: FinalReport
----

The LLM decides action ordering based on this information, making informed decisions without being constrained by declared dependencies.

===== Interoperability

Using wrapper request types (like `MarketDataRequest`) enables actions to work with *any planner*:

* *GOAP*: Request types flow through the blackboard based on preconditions/effects
* *Utility*: Actions fire when their request types are available with highest net value
* *Supervisor*: The LLM constructs request objects to call actions

This means you can switch planners without changing your action code--useful for testing with deterministic planners (GOAP) and deploying with flexible planners (Supervisor).

===== Comparison with LangGraph

https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-supervisor-py[LangGraph's supervisor pattern] is a popular approach for multi-agent orchestration.
Here's how a similar workflow looks in LangGraph vs Embabel:

.LangGraph (Python)
[source,python]
----
from langgraph_supervisor import create_supervisor
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

# Tools return strings - no type information
def gather_market_data(topic: str) -> str:
    """Gather market data for a topic."""
    return f"Revenue data for {topic}..."  # <1>

def analyze_competitors(companies: str) -> str:
    """Analyze competitors."""
    return f"Analysis of {companies}..."  # <1>

# Create agents with tools
research_agent = create_react_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[gather_market_data, analyze_competitors],
    name="research_expert",
)

# Supervisor sees all tools, always  # <2>
workflow = create_supervisor([research_agent], model=model)
app = workflow.compile()

# State is a dict of messages  # <3>
result = app.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Research cloud market"}]})
----

<1> Tools return strings--the LLM must parse and interpret results
<2> All tools always visible--no filtering based on context
<3> State is untyped message history

.Embabel
[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
@Agent(planner = PlannerType.SUPERVISOR)
public class MarketResearchAgent {

    // Tools return typed objects with schemas  // <1>
    @Action(description = "Gather market data for a topic")
    public MarketData gatherMarketData(MarketDataRequest request, Ai ai) {
        return ai.withDefaultLlm().createObject(
            "Generate market data for " + request.topic(), MarketData.class);
    }

    @Action(description = "Analyze competitors")
    public CompetitorAnalysis analyzeCompetitors(CompetitorAnalysisRequest request, Ai ai) {
        return ai.withDefaultLlm().createObject(
            "Analyze " + request.companies(), CompetitorAnalysis.class);
    }

    @AchievesGoal
    @Action
    public FinalReport compileReport(ReportRequest request, Ai ai) { ... }
}

// State is a typed blackboard  // <2>
// Tools are filtered based on available inputs  // <3>
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin]
----
@Agent(planner = PlannerType.SUPERVISOR)
class MarketResearchAgent {

    // Tools return typed objects with schemas  // <1>
    @Action(description = "Gather market data for a topic")
    fun gatherMarketData(request: MarketDataRequest, ai: Ai): MarketData {
        return ai.withDefaultLlm().createObject("Generate market data for ${request.topic}")
    }

    @Action(description = "Analyze competitors")
    fun analyzeCompetitors(request: CompetitorAnalysisRequest, ai: Ai): CompetitorAnalysis {
        return ai.withDefaultLlm().createObject("Analyze ${request.companies}")
    }

    @AchievesGoal
    @Action
    fun compileReport(request: ReportRequest, ai: Ai): FinalReport { ... }
}

// State is a typed blackboard  // <2>
// Tools are filtered based on available inputs  // <3>
----
====

<1> Tools return typed, validated objects--`MarketData`, `CompetitorAnalysis`
<2> Blackboard holds typed artifacts, not just message strings
<3> Tools with satisfied inputs are prioritized via currying

===== Key Advantages

Embabel's Supervisor offers several advantages over typical supervisor implementations:

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Aspect |Typical Supervisor (LangGraph) |Embabel Supervisor

|*Output Types*
|Strings--LLM must parse
|Typed objects--validated and structured

|*Tool Visibility*
|All tools always available
|Tools filtered by blackboard state (currying)

|*Domain Awareness*
|None--tools are opaque functions
|Type schemas visible to LLM

|*Determinism*
|Fully non-deterministic
|Semi-deterministic: tool availability constrained by types

|*State*
|Untyped message history
|Typed blackboard with named artifacts
|===

====== Blackboard-Driven Tool Filtering

A key differentiator is *curried tool filtering*.
When an action's inputs are already on the blackboard, those parameters are "curried out"--the tool signature simplifies.

[NOTE]
.What is Currying?
====
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying[Currying] is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple parameters is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single parameter.

In Embabel's context: if an action requires `(MarketDataRequest, Ai)` and `MarketDataRequest` is already on the blackboard, we "curry out" that parameter--the tool exposed to the LLM only needs to provide any remaining parameters.
This simplifies the LLM's task and signals which tools are "ready" to run.
====

[source]
----
# Initial state: empty blackboard
Available tools:
- gatherMarketData(request: MarketDataRequest) -> MarketData
- analyzeCompetitors(request: CompetitorAnalysisRequest) -> CompetitorAnalysis

# After MarketData is gathered:
Available tools:
- gatherMarketData(request: MarketDataRequest) -> MarketData  [READY - 0 params needed]
- analyzeCompetitors(request: CompetitorAnalysisRequest) -> CompetitorAnalysis
----

This reduces the LLM's decision space and guides it toward logical next steps--tools with satisfied inputs appear "ready" with fewer parameters.
This is more deterministic than showing all tools equally, while remaining more flexible than GOAP's strict ordering.

====== Semi-Determinism

While still LLM-orchestrated, Embabel's Supervisor is *more deterministic* than typical implementations:

1. *Type constraints*: Actions can only produce specific types--no arbitrary string outputs
2. *Input filtering*: Tools unavailable until their input types exist
3. *Schema guidance*: LLM sees what each action produces, not just descriptions
4. *Validated outputs*: Results must conform to declared types

This makes debugging easier and behaviour more predictable, while retaining the flexibility that makes supervisor patterns valuable.

====== When Embabel's Approach Excels

* *Domain-rich workflows*: When your domain has clear types (reports, analyses, forecasts), schemas help the LLM understand relationships
* *Multi-step synthesis*: When actions build on each other's outputs, typed blackboard tracks progress clearly
* *Hybrid determinism*: When you want more predictability than pure LLM orchestration but more flexibility than GOAP

[[reference.planners__supervisor-invocation]]
===== SupervisorInvocation: Lightweight Supervisor Pattern

For simple supervisor workflows, you don't need to create an `@Agent` class.
`SupervisorInvocation` provides a fluent API to run supervisor-orchestrated workflows directly from `@EmbabelComponent` actions.

This is ideal when:

* You have a small set of related actions in an `@EmbabelComponent`
* You want LLM-orchestrated composition without creating a full agent
* You're prototyping or exploring supervisor patterns before committing to a full agent design

====== Example: Meal Preparation Workflow

Here's a complete example from the https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent-examples[embabel-agent-examples] repository:

====== Configuration Options

`SupervisorInvocation` supports several configuration methods:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Method |Description

|`.returning(Class)`
|Specifies the goal type to produce

|`.withScope(AgentScopeBuilder)`
|Defines which actions are available

|`.withAgentName(String)`
|Sets a custom name for the created agent (defaults to `{platformName}.supervisor`)

|`.withGoalDescription(String)`
|Provides a custom description for the goal

|`.withProcessOptions(ProcessOptions)`
|Configures process-level options
|===

.Setting a custom agent name
[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source,java]
----
SupervisorInvocation.on(agentPlatform)
    .returning(Report.class)
    .withScope(AgentScopeBuilder.fromInstance(actions))
    .withAgentName("market-research-supervisor")
    .invoke(request);
----

Kotlin::
+
[source,kotlin]
----
SupervisorInvocation.on(agentPlatform)
    .returning(Report::class.java)
    .withScope(AgentScopeBuilder.fromInstance(actions))
    .withAgentName("market-research-supervisor")
    .invoke(request)
----
====

The supervisor LLM sees:

1. *Available actions* with their type signatures and schemas
2. *Current artifacts* on the blackboard (including `UserInput` content)
3. *Goal* to produce a `Meal`

It then orchestrates the actions—calling `chooseCook` and `takeOrder` (possibly in parallel), then `prepareMeal` when the dependencies are satisfied.

====== Key Design Points

1. **Actions use UserInput explicitly**: Each action receives `UserInput` and includes it in the LLM prompt, ensuring the actual user request is used.
2. **@AchievesGoal marks the target**: The `prepareMeal` action is marked with `@AchievesGoal` to indicate it produces the final output.
3. **Type-driven dependencies**: `prepareMeal` requires `Cook` and `Order`, which guides the supervisor's orchestration.

====== SupervisorInvocation vs @Agent with planner = SUPERVISOR

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Aspect |SupervisorInvocation |@Agent(planner = SUPERVISOR)

|*Declaration*
|Fluent API, no class annotation
|Annotated agent class

|*Action source*
|`@EmbabelComponent` or multiple components
|Single `@Agent` class

|*Best for*
|Quick prototypes, simple workflows
|Formalized, reusable agents

|*Goal specification*
|`.returning(Class)` fluent method
|`@AchievesGoal` on action

|*Scope*
|Explicit via `AgentScopeBuilder`
|Implicit from agent class
|===

====== Comparison with AgenticTool

Both `SupervisorInvocation` and <<reference.tools__agentic-tools,AgenticTool>> provide LLM-orchestrated composition, but at different levels:

[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
|Aspect |AgenticTool |SupervisorInvocation

|*Level*
|Tool (can be used within actions)
|Invocation (runs a complete workflow)

|*Sub-components*
|Other `Tool` instances
|`@Action` methods from `@EmbabelComponent`

|*Output*
|`Tool.Result` (text, artifact, or error)
|Typed goal object (e.g., `Meal`)

|*State management*
|Minimal (LLM conversation only)
|Full blackboard with typed artifacts

|*Type awareness*
|Tools have names and descriptions
|Actions have typed inputs/outputs with schemas

|*Currying*
|None
|Inputs on blackboard are curried out

|*Use case*
|Mini-orchestration within an action
|Complete multi-step workflow with typed results
|===

Use `AgenticTool` when you need a tool that internally orchestrates other tools.
Use `SupervisorInvocation` when you need a complete workflow that produces a typed result with full blackboard state management.
