# Evaluation Methodology

All tasks are evaluated using a rubric-based methodology. Every task defines its rubric inline in `task.json` as a list of equally-weighted pass/fail criteria that an LLM judge grades individually. There is no separate gold standard file -- each criterion's `match_criteria` field describes exactly what the judge should look for in the agent's output.

An **LLM judge** (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`) reads the agent's output and evaluates it against each criterion's `match_criteria`. No keyword matching or regex is used; every comparison is semantic. No golden reference output is needed. The rubric schema handles every shape of legal work product: drafting tasks graded on quality dimensions, issue-spotting tasks where specific findings must appear, and structured deliverables where discrete data points are required. Task authors encode what matters into the `match_criteria` field of each criterion.

## How It Works

1. **Rubric criteria**: Defined inline in `task.json` under `criteria` -- a list of equally-weighted criteria, each with a `match_criteria` description of what the judge should verify.
2. **Deliverables map**: The top-level `deliverables` field in `task.json` maps expected output filenames to their canonical name. Each criterion declares which deliverables are relevant to it.
3. **Agent output**: The agent writes files to the `output/` directory. The filenames must match the deliverables map.
4. For each criterion, the LLM judge reads only the relevant output files (scoped by the criterion's `deliverables` list) and evaluates whether the agent's work satisfies the `match_criteria`.
5. Each criterion receives a binary verdict: **pass** or **fail**.
6. **All-pass grading**: the task scores `1.0` only if every criterion passed, else `0.0`. See [Scoring Details](#scoring-details).

## Criterion Schema

Each entry in `criteria` has these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier (e.g. `"C-001"`, `"C-002"`) |
| `title` | string | Descriptive title for the criterion |
| `match_criteria` | string | The substantive evaluation standard -- what the judge should look for in the agent's output |
| `deliverables` | array | List of output filenames (from the top-level `deliverables` map) this criterion applies to |
| `sources` | array | (Optional) Source document filenames in the VDR relevant to this criterion |
| `evaluation_options` | object | (Optional) Criterion-specific evaluation options, such as whether to include DOCX redlines |

**Example**:

```json
{
  "id": "C-001",
  "title": "Identifies key contract as requiring change-of-control consent",
  "match_criteria": "PASS if the agent identifies the key customer contract contains a change-of-control consent requirement (Section 14.3 or equivalent reference). FAIL if the agent does not mention the change-of-control consent requirement.",
  "deliverables": ["red-flag-memo.docx"],
  "sources": []
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "C-002",
  "title": "Notes consent has NOT been obtained",
  "match_criteria": "PASS if the agent states that no consent has been obtained for the change of control. FAIL if the agent does not note the absence of consent.",
  "deliverables": ["red-flag-memo.docx"],
  "sources": []
}
```

## Deliverables Map

The top-level `deliverables` field in `task.json` maps expected output filenames to their canonical name:

```json
{
  "deliverables": {
    "ddq-responses.docx": "ddq-responses.docx",
    "issues-memo.docx": "issues-memo.docx",
    "questions-requiring-input.docx": "questions-requiring-input.docx"
  }
}
```

Each criterion's `deliverables` array references filenames from this map. When scoring a criterion, the evaluation pipeline loads only the output files relevant to that criterion -- so a criterion about DDQ response accuracy only sees the DDQ responses file, not the issues memo. This scoping gives the judge focused context and prevents cross-contamination between unrelated deliverables.

For tasks with a single output file, the deliverables map is straightforward:

```json
{
  "deliverables": {
    "output.md": "output.md"
  }
}
```

And every criterion's `deliverables` list is simply `["output.md"]`.

## Scoring Details

The scoring logic lives in `score_rubric` in `evaluation/scoring.py`.

For each criterion, the function:
1. Loads the output files named in that criterion's `deliverables` list, using the top-level `deliverables` map to resolve names to filenames in `run_dir/output/`.
2. Calls the LLM judge with the `rubric_criterion` prompt template, passing the task description, the scoped agent output, the criterion title, and the `match_criteria` text.
3. The judge returns `"pass"` or `"fail"` with reasoning.

The task score is binary, computed as:

```
score = 1.0 if every criterion passed else 0.0
```

This is the **all-pass** grading scheme. A task is only marked pass if every rubric criterion passes — there is no partial credit at the task level. There is no partial credit within a criterion either: each one passes or fails. There is no golden reference output -- the judge evaluates the agent's work directly against the `match_criteria` description.

**Why all-pass.** In legal production settings, a graded mean is misleading. A diligence memo that catches 95% of issues but misses one material one is not 95% useful — it's wrong. The operational question is "how often does the agent get everything right?" That is what the score answers, run-by-run.

### Diagnostic: criterion pass rate

Every `scores.json` also records three diagnostic fields so you can see how close a model came when it didn't all-pass:

- `all_pass` (bool) — `true` only if every rubric criterion passed (equivalent to `score == 1.0`)
- `n_criteria` (int) — total criteria evaluated
- `n_passed` (int) — criteria the judge marked `pass`

The comparison dashboard (`uv run python -m evaluation.compare --all`) ranks configs by **all-pass rate** (share of runs where every criterion passed) and reports the **criterion pass rate** (passed criteria / total criteria, pooled across runs) as a diagnostic alongside it. The per-run HTML report surfaces an `ALL PASS` / `MISSED N` badge in the summary tile.

Rubric authors should keep this in mind: criteria that are "nice-to-have" padding drag down the all-pass rate without surfacing real quality signal. Rubrics should ideally contain the criteria that a supervising attorney would actually check before sending work to a client — nothing more.

### Optional standard dual-judge profile

Single-judge evaluation remains the default. Pass `--dual` to
`evaluation.run_eval` to grade one saved trajectory independently with the
standard LAB judge pair:

- `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `gpt-5.5`

The evaluator preserves each judge's complete score artifact and writes
`scores_dual.json` only after both judges succeed. For each judge, criterion
pass is `n_passed / n_criteria` and task all-pass is binary. The dual values
are their arithmetic means:

```text
dual_criterion_pass = mean(per-judge criterion-pass fractions)
dual_all_pass_rate  = mean(per-judge task all-pass values)
```

Therefore, one task's dual all-pass rate is `0.0`, `0.5`, or `1.0`.
The aggregate `all_pass` field requires both judges to all-pass.

Across multiple tasks, the comparison output includes both existing LAB
criterion diagnostics:

- `criterion_pass_rate_macro`: average task-level criterion-pass fraction,
  giving each task equal weight.
- `criterion_pass_rate_pooled`: total passed criteria divided by total
  criteria, giving each criterion equal weight.

The existing `criterion_pass_rate` field remains an alias for the pooled value
for backward compatibility. The canonical headline remains the averaged
all-pass rate; strict both-agree all-pass is reported separately.

## Example Output

## How the LLM Judge Works

The judge is a separate LLM call that mediates every comparison between a criterion's `match_criteria` and the agent's output. It is implemented in `evaluation/judge.py` as the `Judge` class.

### Architecture

1. The `Judge` is initialized with a model ID (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`). It creates its own `anthropic.Anthropic()` client.
2. When the scoring function needs a verdict, it calls `judge.evaluate_from_file(prompt_name, variables)`.
3. The judge loads the `rubric_criterion` prompt template from `evaluation/prompts/`, substitutes the variables, and sends the formatted prompt to the model at temperature 0.0.
4. The model returns a JSON response with a `verdict` field and a `reasoning` field.
5. The judge parses the JSON (handling markdown code fences) and returns the structured result.

### Prompt Template

The prompt template lives in `evaluation/prompts/rubric_criterion.txt`. It receives four variables:

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `task_description` | `task.json` `title` field |
| `agent_output` | Concatenation of the relevant deliverable files (scoped per criterion) |
| `criterion_title` | The criterion's `title` field |
| `match_criteria` | The criterion's `match_criteria` field -- the substantive evaluation standard |

The prompt instructs the judge to evaluate the agent's output against the criterion and respond with a JSON object containing `verdict` ("pass" or "fail") and `reasoning`.

Note that there is no golden reference output in the prompt. The `match_criteria` field serves as the evaluation standard directly -- it describes what a passing answer looks like, what facts must appear, or what analysis must be performed.

### Design Decisions

- **Temperature 0.0**: The judge runs deterministically to maximize reproducibility across evaluation runs.
- **Binary verdicts**: No partial credit. This keeps scoring simple and interpretable -- every criterion is either satisfied or not.
- **Semantic matching**: The judge is instructed to match on substance, not wording. An agent that captures the required analysis in different language still passes.
- **One criterion at a time**: Each criterion gets its own judge call. This prevents interference between criteria and makes the reasoning traceable.
- **Scoped deliverables**: Each criterion only sees the output files it declares, not the full output directory. This gives the judge focused context.
- **No golden reference**: The `match_criteria` text is the standard. This eliminates the need to maintain separate gold standard files and makes criteria self-contained.
- **Reasoning recorded**: The judge's reasoning for every verdict is stored in `scores.json`, enabling post-hoc review of borderline calls.
