# Tutorial

This tutorial walks through Harvey Labs end to end: setting up your environment, giving an agent a realistic legal assignment, watching it work through a matter file, and evaluating the final work product against expert-written rubric criteria.

The whole flow takes about 20 minutes for a small model run, most of it waiting for the agent and judge calls. By the end, you will know how to run any task in the benchmark, swap models, grade outputs, inspect reports, and plan larger sweeps.

> [!NOTE]
> Documents across the benchmark are synthetically generated in large batches, under the guidance and review of human lawyers. While they represent real world legal work in substantive complexity, they contain imperfections and should not be taken as perfectly reflecting documents drafted from scratch by a practicing lawyer.

## What We're Going To Do

We are going to provide an agent with a task and a set of documents with which to complete that task. Once it accomplishes the provided task, we will use LLMs-as-judge to score that task and then expand to running other tasks or models against the dataset.

The first tutorial task is:

```text
corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review
```

It includes 60 synthetic matter documents and a 68-criterion rubric.

---

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Clone the repository and run `scripts/setup.sh`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harveyai/harvey-labs.git
cd harvey-labs && ./scripts/setup.sh
```

The first run takes a few minutes. Subsequent runs can be set up in seconds.

> [!NOTE]
> On **Windows**, the very first run installs WSL2 and asks you to reboot. Re-run `./scripts/setup.sh` afterward and it picks up where it left off. Requires Windows 11 and CPU virtualization enabled in BIOS/UEFI.

## Step 2: Connect A Model Provider

Now we need to give the agent access to a language model. The benchmark uses Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) as the default LLM judge that grades results, so an **Anthropic API key is required**. You can also run the agent on OpenAI (GPT, o-series) or Google (Gemini) models — those keys are **optional**, only needed if you want to benchmark those providers. The optional standard dual-judge mode also requires an **OpenAI API key** because its second judge is `gpt-5.5`.

Put your key(s) into a `.env` file at the repo root. Create or open `.env` in your editor and add a line for each provider you have:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

One key per line, no quotes. The harness loads `.env` automatically on every run, so you only do this once. `.env` is in `.gitignore`, so your keys won't be committed.

This tutorial uses Anthropic examples, but the same task can be run with OpenAI or Google model IDs.

---

## Step 3: Understand The Task

Task IDs mirror paths under `tasks/`. A task can be flat:

```text
corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review
```

or nested:

```text
real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms/scenario-01
```

Start by inspecting the M&A red-flag task:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.describe_task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review
```

You should see something like:

```text
Task: Project Ridgeline - Data Room Red Flag Review for Environmental Services Acquisition
Task ID: corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review
Practice Area: corporate-ma
Work Type: review
Deliverables: red-flag-memorandum.docx

Documents: 60 files in tasks/corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review/documents/

Rubric (68 criteria):
   1. [C-001] Includes summary red flag table -> red-flag-memorandum.docx
   2. [C-002] Includes non-issues / distractor discussion section -> red-flag-memorandum.docx
   3. [C-003] ISSUE_001: Identifies USACE small business certification fraud risk -> red-flag-memorandum.docx
   ...
```

This tells us three important things:

- The agent must produce `red-flag-memorandum.docx`.
- The source matter file contains 60 documents.
- The judge will evaluate the memo against 68 pass/fail criteria.

If you want to browse the whole benchmark first:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.list_tasks
uv run python -m utils.list_tasks --area corporate-ma
uv run python -m utils.list_tasks --work-type draft
uv run python -m utils.list_tasks --difficulty medium
```

---

## Step 4: Run The Agent

Now run an agent against the task:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review \
  --max-turns 200
```

The harness will:

1. Load `task.json`.
2. Build a system prompt from `harness/system_prompt.md`, any loaded skills, and the task instructions.
3. Create a model adapter for the selected provider.
4. Expose six workspace tools to the agent: `bash`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, and `grep`.
5. Run the model/tool loop until the model stops calling tools or hits the turn limit.
6. Save the transcript, metrics, and deliverables under `results/`.

A run summary looks like this:

```text
Loading task: corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review
Creating adapter for: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
Starting agent loop (max 200 turns)...
Tools: 6 (bash, read, write, edit, glob, grep)
Documents: /.../tasks/corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review/documents
Output: /.../results/corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review/claude-sonnet-4-6/20260428-142301/output

============================================================
Run complete: corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review/claude-sonnet-4-6/20260428-142301
  Model:          anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
  Turns:          24
  Input tokens:   210,450
  Output tokens:  18,930
  Wall clock:     180.4s
  Docs read:      31/60
  Finished:       True

Results saved to: results/corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review/claude-sonnet-4-6/20260428-142301
```

Copy the run ID printed after `Run complete`. For the example output above, the run ID is `corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review/claude-sonnet-4-6/20260428-142301`. You will use it to grade and report the run. Subsequent steps in this tutorial will use `<run-id>` as a placeholder. Substitute the run ID printed by your own run wherever you see `<run-id>`.

---

## Step 5: Inspect The Run

Every run directory contains:

| File | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `config.json` | Model, task, run ID, turn limit, temperature, reasoning effort, and loaded skills |
| `metrics.json` | Token counts, wall-clock time, document coverage, and tool counts |
| `transcript.jsonl` | Full turn-by-turn model and tool trace |
| `output/` | Agent-created deliverables |

For this task, the primary deliverable should be:

```text
output/red-flag-memorandum.docx
```

You can inspect text outputs directly. For `.docx` files, use Pandoc or the evaluator/report output:

```bash
pandoc results/<run-id>/output/red-flag-memorandum.docx -t markdown --wrap=none | sed -n '1,80p'
```

The transcript is useful when you want to understand how the agent got to its answer:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.playback --run-id <run-id> --format terminal
```

---

## Step 6: Grade The Output

Now grade the memo against the task rubric:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.run_eval \
  --run-id <run-id> \
  --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review
```

The evaluator:

1. Loads the task's `criteria` from `task.json`.
2. Loads the relevant deliverable file for each criterion.
3. Sends the scoped output and criterion `match_criteria` to the LLM judge.
4. Records a `pass` or `fail` verdict and reasoning for every criterion.
5. Writes `scores.json`.
6. Generates `report.html`.

The headline score is all-pass:

```text
score = 1.0 if every criterion passed else 0.0
```

That sounds harsh, but it is intentional. In legal work, missing one material red flag can matter more than getting many easy points right. The criterion pass rate is still reported as a diagnostic so you can see whether a failed run missed one issue or many.

### Optional standard dual judging

Official-style comparisons can grade the same saved deliverables with the
standard Sonnet 4.6 and GPT-5.5 judge pair:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.run_eval \
  --run-id <run-id> \
  --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review \
  --dual
```

This mode is opt-in and requires both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and
`OPENAI_API_KEY`. It writes:

- `scores_claude-sonnet-4-6.json`
- `scores_gpt-5.5.json`
- `scores_dual.json`, only after both judges complete

The dual all-pass value is the average of the judges' binary task results, so
it is `0.0`, `0.5`, or `1.0` for one task. The aggregate `all_pass` field is
true only when both judges pass every criterion. If one judge fails
operationally, the successful judge's artifact is preserved, but no complete
dual aggregate is written.

---

## Step 7: Read The Report

Regenerate the report if needed:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.report \
  --run-id <run-id>
```

Open:

```text
results/<run-id>/report.html
```

The report shows:

- Overall all-pass score
- Criteria passed and failed
- Document coverage
- Judge model
- Expandable criterion-by-criterion reasoning

This is usually the fastest way to understand what a model missed.

---

## Step 8: Try A Different Model

Run the same task with an OpenAI model:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model openai/gpt-5.4 \
  --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review \
  --max-turns 200
```

Run it with a Google model:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview \
  --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review \
  --max-turns 200
```

You can also control model reasoning depth when the provider supports it:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 \
  --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review \
  --reasoning-effort high \
  --max-turns 200
```

Grade each run with `uv run python -m evaluation.run_eval`, then compare reports side by side.

---

## Step 9: Try Other Work Types

The benchmark covers analysis, drafting, review, extraction, and research workflows.

Draft a stock purchase agreement package:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --task corporate-ma/draft-spa-drafting \
  --max-turns 200
```

Extract structured real estate PSA terms:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --task real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms/scenario-01 \
  --max-turns 80
```

Draft a bankruptcy DIP financing motion:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --task bankruptcy-restructuring/draft-dip-financing-motion \
  --max-turns 200
```

Review NDAs against a playbook:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --task corporate-governance/review-nda-playbook-review \
  --max-turns 200
```

Every task follows the same basic workflow: inspect, run, score, report.

---

## Step 10: Run A Sweep

Once you are comfortable with single runs, use the sweep tool to run model/task matrices.

Always dry-run first:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.sweep \
  --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review \
  --models sonnet opus \
  --dry-run
```

Run the sweep:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.sweep \
  --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review \
  --models sonnet opus \
  --parallel 2
```

Run every task under a practice area:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.sweep \
  --task corporate-ma \
  --models sonnet \
  --reasoning high \
  --parallel 4
```

The sweep tool performs all three phases:

1. Agent runs.
2. Evaluation.
3. Report generation.

It also supports nested workflow directories. This command finds both scenarios under the workflow:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.sweep \
  --task real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms \
  --models sonnet \
  --dry-run
```

---

## Step 11: Compare Results

Generate comparison dashboards:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.compare --task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review
uv run python -m evaluation.compare --area corporate-ma
uv run python -m evaluation.compare --all
```

Dashboards summarize:

- All-pass rate
- Pooled criterion pass rate
- Per-criterion heatmaps
- Document coverage
- Tokens and wall-clock time
- Estimated cost

The all-pass rate is the headline metric. Criterion pass rate is the diagnostic that explains how close a model came when it did not all-pass.

## Step 12: Explore The Full Benchmark

Harvey Labs currently includes 1,660 tasks across 24 legal practice areas and contracting.

```bash
uv run python -m utils.list_tasks
uv run python -m utils.list_tasks --area litigation-dispute-resolution
uv run python -m utils.list_tasks --area tax
uv run python -m utils.list_tasks --work-type research
```

Interesting tasks to inspect:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.describe_task corporate-ma/review-data-room-red-flag-review
uv run python -m utils.describe_task real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms/scenario-01
uv run python -m utils.describe_task litigation-dispute-resolution/draft-case-assessment-memorandum
uv run python -m utils.describe_task tax/draft-cross-border-acquisition-tax-memo
uv run python -m utils.describe_task funds-asset-management/draft-lpa/scenario-01
```

## Appendix: Task Schema

Every task is defined by a `task.json` file:

```json
{
  "title": "Data Room Red Flag Review - Acquisition Due Diligence",
  "work_type": "review",
  "tags": ["M&A", "due-diligence", "data-room"],
  "instructions": "Review the data room and produce `red-flag-memorandum.docx` identifying issues that materially affect the acquisition.",
  "deliverables": {
    "red-flag-memorandum.docx": "red-flag-memorandum.docx"
  },
  "criteria": [
    {
      "id": "C-001",
      "title": "Identifies key contract as requiring change-of-control consent",
      "match_criteria": "PASS if the agent identifies the key customer contract contains a change-of-control consent requirement. FAIL if it does not mention the consent requirement.",
      "deliverables": ["red-flag-memorandum.docx"],
      "sources": ["customer-contract.docx"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Key points:

- `instructions` is sent to the agent.
- `deliverables` tells the evaluator which output files to expect.
- `criteria` is the evaluation standard; there is no separate gold answer file.
- New criteria should not include legacy `weight` fields.
