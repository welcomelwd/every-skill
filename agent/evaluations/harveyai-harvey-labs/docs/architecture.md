# Architecture

Harvey Labs is a filesystem-first benchmark harness. There is no database and no web service: tasks live under `tasks/`, runs live under `results/`, and reports are generated as static HTML.

The system has three phases:

1. **Run**: an agent reads a synthetic matter file and writes deliverables.
2. **Evaluate**: an LLM judge grades the deliverables against rubric criteria.
3. **Report**: the evaluator writes per-run reports and comparison dashboards.

```

## Task Model

Every task is a directory containing `task.json` and a `documents/` folder:

```text
tasks/
  <practice-area>/
    <task-or-workflow>/
      <optional-scenario>/
        task.json
        documents/
```

Flat and nested task IDs are both valid:

```text
corporate-ma/analyze-change-of-control-provisions-across-targets-material-contracts
real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms/scenario-01
```

Important `task.json` fields:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `title` | Human-readable task title |
| `instructions` | Directional prompt sent to the agent |
| `work_type` | `analyze`, `draft`, `review`, or `research` |
| `deliverables` | Expected output filenames |
| `criteria` | Inline pass/fail rubric criteria |
| `tags` | Discovery and analysis metadata |

---

## Harness

Entry point:

```bash
uv run python -m harness.run \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --task real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms/scenario-01
```

`harness/run.py` is responsible for:

- Loading the task and source documents.
- Loading the shared system prompt from `harness/system_prompt.md`.
- Loading any skill manuals under `harness/skills/`.
- Creating the provider-specific model adapter.
- Creating the `ToolExecutor`.
- Running the agent loop.
- Writing `config.json`, `transcript.jsonl`, `metrics.json`, and agent outputs.

Run IDs default to:

```text
{task}/{model-short}{-reasoning-effort}/{timestamp}
```

Example:

```text
real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms/scenario-01/claude-sonnet-4-6-high/20260428-142301
```

---

## Agent Loop

The core loop lives in `harness/agent_loop.py`.

At a high level:

1. Start with a system message containing the harness preamble, loaded skills, and task instructions.
2. Call `adapter.chat(messages, tools)`.
3. Append the model response to the transcript.
4. If there are no tool calls, stop.
5. Execute tool calls with `ToolExecutor`.
6. Convert tool outputs back into provider-native messages.
7. Continue until the model stops or `--max-turns` is reached.

There is no explicit finish tool. The run finishes when the model stops calling tools.

---

## Tools

The agent has six closed-workspace tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bash` | Execute shell commands inside the run workspace with `WORKSPACE_DIR`, `DOCUMENTS_DIR`, and `OUTPUT_DIR` set |
| `read` | Read `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.pdf`, and text files |
| `write` | Write deliverables under the output directory |
| `edit` | Replace exact strings in an output/workspace file |
| `glob` | Find files by glob pattern |
| `grep` | Search file contents by regex |

Document parsing is handled by Pandoc, MarkItDown, pandas, openpyxl-compatible readers, and pdfplumber depending on file type.

Tool metrics are written to `metrics.json`, including documents read, documents skipped, shell calls, files written, files edited, glob searches, and grep searches.

---

## Security Model

Every agent run executes inside a per-task Podman sandbox (`--network=none --cap-drop=ALL`, writable `/workspace` with read-only `/workspace/documents` and writable `/workspace/output` overlaying it). All six tools — `bash`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep` — route through the same sandbox interface, so attacker-controlled file content (e.g. crafted `.docx`) is parsed inside the container, not on the host. See [`sandbox/README.md`](../sandbox/README.md) for the threat model and filesystem layout.

---

## Model Adapters

Adapters live under `harness/adapters/` and implement the `ModelAdapter` interface:

```python
class ModelAdapter:
    def chat(self, messages: list[dict], tools: list[dict]) -> ModelResponse: ...
    def make_tool_result_messages(self, results: list[tuple[str, str]]) -> list[dict]: ...
    def make_system_message(self, content: str) -> dict: ...
    def make_user_message(self, content: str) -> dict: ...
```

Current adapters:

| Provider | Adapter | Model prefixes |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | `harness/adapters/anthropic.py` | `claude*` |
| OpenAI | `harness/adapters/openai.py` | `gpt*`, `o1*`, `o3*`, `o4*` |
| Google | `harness/adapters/google.py` | `gemini*` |
| Mistral | `harness/adapters/mistral.py` | `mistral*` |
| Fireworks | `harness/adapters/fireworks.py` | `kimi*`, `glm*`, `nemotron*`, `accounts/fireworks/*` |

Provider-prefixed IDs such as `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` are accepted; the provider prefix is stripped before adapter routing. Fireworks-served open models are addressed by bare name (e.g. `kimi-k2p6`, `glm-5p2`, `nemotron-3-ultra-nvfp4`) and the adapter expands them to the serverless path `accounts/fireworks/models/<name>`; a full resource path may also be passed explicitly.

---

## Evaluation

Entry point:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.run_eval \
  --run-id <run-id> \
  --task <task-id> \
  --judge-model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

`evaluation/run_eval.py`:

- Resolves the task directory under `tasks/`.
- Loads and validates `task.json`.
- Calls `score_rubric()` in `evaluation/scoring.py`.
- Writes `scores.json` in the default single-judge mode.
- With `--dual`, grades independently with Sonnet 4.6 and GPT-5.5, preserves
  per-judge files, and writes `scores_dual.json` only when both complete.
- Generates `report.html`.

All tasks use all-pass rubric scoring:

```text
score = 1.0 if every criterion passed else 0.0
```

Each criterion is evaluated independently. The judge receives the task title, the scoped agent output for that criterion's deliverables, the criterion title, and the criterion's `match_criteria`.

There is no separate golden answer file. The `match_criteria` text is the evaluation standard.

---

## Reporting

Per-run report:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.report --run-id <run-id>
```

Comparison dashboards:

```bash
uv run python -m evaluation.compare --task <task-id>
uv run python -m evaluation.compare --area <practice-area>
uv run python -m evaluation.compare --all
```

Dashboards summarize all-pass rate, pooled criterion pass rate, criteria-level heatmaps, document coverage, token usage, latency, and estimated cost.

---

## Sweeps

Entry point:

```bash
uv run python -m utils.sweep --task real-estate --models sonnet --parallel 4
```

`utils/sweep.py` runs all three phases across a model matrix:

1. Preflight task loading and rubric checks.
2. Agent runs in parallel.
3. Evaluation with bounded judge parallelism.
4. Per-run and comparison report generation.

Task resolution supports:

| Input | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `all` | Every `tasks/**/task.json` |
| `corporate-ma` | Every task under a practice area |
| `real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms` | Every nested scenario under a workflow |
| `real-estate/extract-psa-key-terms/scenario-01` | One exact task |

---

## Results Layout

```text
results/<practice-area>/<task-or-workflow>/<optional-scenario>/<model-config>/<timestamp>/
  config.json
  transcript.jsonl
  metrics.json
  output/
  scores.json
  report.html
```

`results/` is ignored by git.
