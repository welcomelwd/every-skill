/**
 * `FactoryIntegration` — the common contract for pluggable web integrations
 * (GitHub, Linear, third-party).
 *
 * Each integration is a self-contained class: the deploy entry
 * (`src/mastra/index.ts`) reads that integration's env vars ONCE, constructs
 * an instance with explicit credentials, and passes it to `MastraFactory`
 * via `integrations: [...]`. The factory registers the pieces each instance
 * provides — HTTP routes, agent/session tools, diagnostics — into the system.
 * No system code reads integration env vars or imports integration free
 * functions; everything downstream talks to instances through this interface.
 *
 * An absent integration means: its routes never mount, its tools never
 * register, diagnostics report "not configured", and the server boots fine.
 * Third parties add capabilities by implementing this same interface — no
 * factory changes required (the same capability-based philosophy as the
 * sandbox machine's `derive()` gate).
