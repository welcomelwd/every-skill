/**
 * `SlackIntegration` — Slack as a `FactoryIntegration`.
 *
 * Slack contributes two things to a factory: the chat channels that carry
 * inbound messages into agent runs (`channels()`), and the browser-facing
 * account-link routes that bind a Slack sender to a Mastra tenant (`routes()`).
 * Both used to be assembled by hand in the deploy entry, which had to reach
 * into the prepared agent controller by string key, resolve storage domains
 * itself, mint its own state signer, and splice routes onto the factory's
 * assembled server config. Implementing the integration interface instead means
 * the factory does all of that the same way it already does for GitHub and
 * Linear, and the entry's job shrinks to reading Slack's env vars once.
 *
 * Slack ships as a factory built-in alongside GitHub and Linear (it originally
 * lived in `mastracode/web` to keep `@mastra/slack`/`chat` out of this package;
 * the team reversed that so `create-factory` consumers get Slack channels out
 * of the box). The integration interface remains open — third parties still add
 * capabilities by implementing `FactoryIntegration` from outside the package.
