Added `upsertExperimentResult()` to the experiments storage domain plus an `attempt` column on experiment results and a nullable target with an optional `scorerIds` column on experiments, enabling retry-safe result writes for caller-driven experiments (retried submissions with the same `(experimentId, itemId, attempt)` key converge on a single row). `saveScore()` now accepts an optional caller-supplied `id` and upserts on it, so retried experiment submissions replace their previous score rows (latest wins) instead of accumulating duplicates.
