 * `threadId` from its execution context and hands the decision to your `onGrant` store. The runtime
 * grants live only where `onGrant` put them: enforce consent by reading them back from your own
 * store — at `onCallEnd` or before any consent-gated action — cross-checking against the declared
 * requirements in `VoiceCallEndArgs.configuration.consentPolicy` (the configuration carries the
 * policy, never the grants).
