/**
 * Builds a Mastra tool the agent calls to end the call itself (say goodbye → hang up). It is the
 * agent-visible half of agent-initiated hang-up: the tool only SIGNALS intent (and runs optional
 * bookkeeping) — it can't reach the LiveKit room from inside `agent.stream()`. The worker owns the
 * hang-up: with `configuration.endCall` set, it watches each turn for this tool, waits for the
 * agent's closing words to finish playing, then disconnects (running `onCallEnd` on the way out).
 * Keeping the tool inside the single agent means it stays visible/editable in Studio and works on
 * the agent and workflow reply paths alike.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // agent tools
 * endCall: createEndCallTool({
 *   onEndCall: ({ reason, resourceId }) => log.info('agent ended call', { reason, resourceId }),
 * }),
 * // worker
 * createLiveKitWorker({ mastra, agent: 'support', configuration: { endCall: {} } });
