# Critical Paths

Brittle code paths in the Mastra monorepo. Each entry lists a file or glob, the GitHub owners who must review changes to it, and a short reason explaining why.

## Instructions for the triage agent

When triaging a PR, do the following:

1. Get the list of changed files in the PR.
2. For each changed file, check whether it matches any `path` entry below. A `**` suffix means every file under that directory.
3. **Auto-close for external contributors**: If the PR author is **not** a member of the `mastra-ai` GitHub organization and any changed file matches one of the following paths, auto-close the PR with a polite comment explaining that these paths require internal ownership and suggesting the contributor open an issue instead. Do not proceed to step 4.
   - `packages/core/src/loop/loop.ts`
   - `packages/deployer/**`
4. If one or more changed files match, add every listed `owner` from the matching entries as a reviewer on the PR. In your triage comment, list each matched path and its `reason` so the reviewer has context.
5. If zero changed files match, this file has no effect on the PR. Continue with normal triage.
