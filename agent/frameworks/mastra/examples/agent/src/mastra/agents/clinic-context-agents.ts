 * Clinic Context Agents
 *
 * Test agents for verifying requestContext propagation through dataset
 * experiments in multi-tenant clinic scenarios.
 *
 * - clinicDirectAgent: calls clinicLookupTool directly
 * - clinicSupervisorAgent: delegates to clinicSpecialistAgent, which calls clinicLookupTool
 *
 * The tool throws if clinicId is missing from requestContext, so experiment
 * items fail visibly instead of hanging silently.
