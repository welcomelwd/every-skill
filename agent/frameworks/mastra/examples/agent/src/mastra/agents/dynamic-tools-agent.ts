/**
 * Dynamic Tools Agent Example
 *
 * This agent demonstrates the dynamic tool search pattern where tools are
 * discovered and loaded on demand rather than being available upfront.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Reduces context token usage by ~94% when working with many tools
 * - Agent discovers tools as needed rather than having all definitions loaded
 * - Tools are loaded per-conversation and persist across turns
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Agent starts with only search_tools and load_tool
 * 2. When agent needs a capability, it searches for relevant tools
 * 3. Agent loads the tool by name
 * 4. On subsequent turns, loaded tools are available via toolsets

 * The Dynamic Tools Agent
 *
 * This agent uses the ToolSearchProcessor to dynamically discover and load tools on demand.
 * The processor injects search_tools and load_tool, and handles tool loading automatically.
 *
 * This approach is simpler than the previous pattern:
 * - No need for a tools function
 * - No need to manually get loaded tools
 * - Processor handles everything via inputProcessors

  instructions: `You are a helpful assistant with access to a large library of tools.

IMPORTANT: You do NOT have direct access to most tools. Instead, you have two special tools:

1. **search_tools**: Use this to search for tools by keyword when you need a capability.
   - Example: If asked to do math, search for "calculator" or "add"
   - Example: If asked about stocks, search for "stock price"

2. **load_tool**: After finding a useful tool, use this to load it by exact name.
   - The tool will be available on your NEXT response.

WORKFLOW:
1. When you need a capability you don't have, use search_tools first
2. Review the search results and pick the most relevant tool
3. Use load_tool to load it
4. Use the tool normally

Example conversation:
User: "What's 5 + 3?"
You: [search_tools for "add" or "calculator"] -> finds calculator_add
You: [load_tool for "calculator_add"] -> tool is now loading
You: "I've found and loaded a calculator tool. Let me add those numbers for you now."

Be proactive about searching for tools when you don't have the capability the user needs.`,
