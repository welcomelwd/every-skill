/**
 * A small refund workflow that mirrors the billing-agent demo, but as a
 * WORKFLOW the agent can call. When an agent has a workflow in its `workflows`
 * config, that workflow is exposed to the model as a tool named
 * `workflow-<workflowName>` and runs through the same `beforeToolCall` boundary
 * as any other tool — so it is mockable with item-level tool mocks.
 *
 * Demo flow in Studio:
 * 1. Run an experiment against the billing agent and have it call the refund
 *    workflow → balances mutate, console prints "💸 LIVE refund".
 * 2. Add a `workflow-refundWorkflow` mock to the dataset item → re-run → the
 *    workflow (and its inner agent + refund side effect) never runs, the mocked
 *    result is returned, and the tool mock report shows the call was served.
 *
 * Note: workflow tools receive a `{ inputData, initialState? }` envelope, so a
 * strict mock's `args` must match that envelope. For free-text/nested args,
 * `matchArgs: 'ignore'` (toolName-only) is usually the practical choice.
