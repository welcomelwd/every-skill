# LongMemEval Investigation Workflow

This document describes how to investigate failing questions in LongMemEval benchmarks to identify root causes and implement fixes.

The point is to find deficiencies in the LongMemEval dataset - there appear to be many broken question/answer pairs where the question is misleading, or the answer includes incorrect information or details that the question didn't ask for.

## Overview

The investigation workflow has 4 stages:

```
pending → investigated → fix-implemented → synced
```

1. **pending**: Initial state for all failed questions
2. **investigated**: Root cause identified and documented
3. **fix-implemented**: Fix has been applied (Observer/Reflector prompt, improved Q/A, etc.)
4. **synced**: Changes synced to `longmemeval_s.json` dataset

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. List all runs with failures
pnpm investigate --list

# 2. Setup investigation for a specific run
pnpm investigate <run-id>

# 3. Open the next uninvestigated question
pnpm investigate --next

# 4. After investigating, mark as done
pnpm investigate --done <question-id>

# 5. After implementing fix, mark as fixed
pnpm investigate --fixed <question-id>

# 6. Sync all fixes to dataset
pnpm investigate --sync
```

## Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Find Failures to Investigate

```bash
# List all runs with failures, grouped by config
pnpm investigate --list

# Filter by config name
pnpm investigate --list -c gpt5
pnpm investigate --list -c om-gemini
```

### Step 2: Setup Investigation

```bash
# Setup investigation directory for a run
pnpm investigate run_1768439350043
```

This creates:

```
investigations/
└── run_1768439350043/
    ├── progress.json           # Tracks investigation status
    └── <question-id>/
        ├── analysis.md         # Investigation template
        └── data/
            ├── original.json   # Raw dataset for this question
            ├── result.json     # Evaluation result
            ├── om.md           # Agent's context window
            └── om.json         # Prepared OM data (if exists)
```

### Step 3: Investigate Each Question

```bash
# Open the next uninvestigated question in your editor
pnpm investigate --next

# Check current progress
pnpm investigate --status
```

#### Investigation Utilities

The `investigate` command provides several utilities to help diagnose issues:

##### Search Observations

```bash
# Search what the Observer extracted
pnpm investigate --search "keyword" -q <question-id>
```

##### Search Original Dataset

```bash
# Search the raw dataset with full context
pnpm investigate --search-original "keyword" -q <question-id>
```

##### Trace Information Flow

```bash
# Trace a keyword through the entire pipeline
pnpm investigate --trace "keyword" -q <question-id>
```

This shows where information exists at each stage:

- Original dataset sessions
- Stored messages (om.json)
- Extracted observations
- Agent context (om.md)

##### View Sessions

```bash
# List all sessions for a question
pnpm investigate --list-sessions -q <question-id>

# View a specific session
pnpm investigate --session 33 -q <question-id>
```

##### Inspect Question Data

```bash
# Show summary of question's data
pnpm investigate --inspect <question-id>
```

##### View by Date

```bash
# View observations around a specific date
pnpm investigate --date "2023/05/29" -q <question-id>
pnpm investigate --date "May 29" -q <question-id> --context 2
```

### Step 4: Document Findings

Edit the `analysis.md` file for each question:

```markdown
## Failure Category

- [x] Observer missed critical information
- [ ] Reflector lost/merged information incorrectly
- [ ] Agent reasoning error (had info, wrong conclusion)
- [ ] Ambiguous/poorly-worded question
- [ ] Dataset inconsistency/error
- [ ] RAG retrieval miss (if applicable)
- [ ] Other: \_\_\_

## Root Cause Analysis

<!-- Describe what went wrong -->

## Evidence

<!-- Quote relevant parts of om.md, original data, etc. -->

## Potential Improvements

### Observer/Reflector Changes

- **Likelihood**: High
- **Suggested prompt change**: ...

### Fixed Question/Answer

- **improved_question**: ...
- **improved_answer**: ...
- **improvement_note**: ...
```

### Step 5: Mark as Investigated

```bash
pnpm investigate --done <question-id>
```

This:

- Extracts the failure category from `analysis.md`
- Updates `progress.json`
- Shows remaining count

### Step 6: Implement Fixes

Based on your investigation, implement fixes:

1. **Observer/Reflector prompt changes**: Edit `packages/memory/src/experiments/observational-memory/observer-agent.ts` or `reflector-agent.ts`

2. **Improved question/answer**: Add to `analysis.md`:

   ```markdown
   ### Fixed Question/Answer

   - **improved_question**: What is the current location of my old sneakers?
   - **improved_answer**: in a shoe rack in my closet
   - **improvement_note**: Original question was ambiguous about timeframe
   ```

3. **Re-prepare data**: If Observer/Reflector prompts changed:
   ```bash
   pnpm prepare om --from-failures ./results/om/run_xxx/failures.json
   ```

### Step 7: Mark as Fixed

```bash
pnpm investigate --fixed <question-id>
```

### Step 8: Sync to Dataset

```bash
pnpm investigate --sync
```

This syncs `improved_question`, `improved_answer`, and `improvement_note` from `analysis.md` files to `longmemeval_s.json`.

## Common Failure Categories

### Observer Missed Information

**Symptoms**: Information exists in original dataset but not in observations.

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
pnpm investigate --trace "keyword" -q <question-id>
# Look for: "❌ Observer missed this information"
```

**Common causes**:

- Statement of intent misclassified as question
- Information buried in long message
- Implicit information not captured

### Reflector Lost Information

**Symptoms**: Information in observations but lost after reflection.

**Diagnosis**: Compare observations before/after reflection in `om.json`.

### Agent Reasoning Error

**Symptoms**: Information present in `om.md` but agent reached wrong conclusion.

**Diagnosis**: Check `om.md` - if the answer is there, it's a reasoning issue.

### Dataset Inconsistency

**Symptoms**: Conflicting information in the dataset itself.

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
pnpm investigate --search-original "keyword" -q <question-id>
# Look for contradictory statements
```

## Tips

1. **Start with `--trace`**: It quickly shows where information was lost.

2. **Use `--search-original`**: See the full context of what the user actually said.

3. **Check the date**: Use `--list-sessions` to find when information was mentioned.

4. **Look for patterns**: Similar failures often have the same root cause.

5. **Document everything**: Good `analysis.md` files help identify systemic issues.

## Example Investigation

```bash
# 1. Find the question
pnpm investigate --list -c om

# 2. Setup
pnpm investigate run_1768439350043

# 3. Start investigating
pnpm investigate --next

# 4. Trace the issue
pnpm investigate --trace "shoe rack" -q 07741c45

# 5. Search original data
pnpm investigate --search-original "shoe rack" -q 07741c45

# 6. View the session
pnpm investigate --session 33 -q 07741c45

# 7. Document findings in analysis.md
# (edit the file)

# 8. Mark as done
pnpm investigate --done 07741c45

# 9. After implementing fix
pnpm investigate --fixed 07741c45

# 10. Sync to dataset
pnpm investigate --sync
```
