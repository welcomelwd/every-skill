//! MCP server for ai-memory.
//!
//! Hosts an [`AiMemoryServer`] that wraps the storage layer and exposes a
//! deliberately narrow tool surface to coding agents. Read-only tools live
//! here; write tools (M3+) and consolidation tools (M7+) follow.
//!
//! Pin the MCP protocol version explicitly so we never fall into the
//! agentmemory #510 / #553 "negotiated-down to a version the client
//! discards tools for" failure mode.
