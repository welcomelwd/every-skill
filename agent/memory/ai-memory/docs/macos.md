# macOS Support

macOS is a supported platform: the workspace test suite runs on macOS CI and
tagged releases publish native `ai-memory-macos-aarch64.tar.gz` (Apple Silicon)
and `ai-memory-macos-x86_64.tar.gz` (Intel) binaries.

On macOS the **native binary** (a prebuilt release or a source build) is the
recommended way to run ai-memory. It binds the server on `127.0.0.1:49374`, and
both the MCP endpoint and the lifecycle hooks talk to that loopback address —
which the native agent can reach and which is already in the default Host-header
allowlist. The Docker wrapper is also supported when you prefer a containerised
server.

Unlike Windows there is only one "path world" on macOS: POSIX paths and POSIX
`.sh` hooks throughout. There is no WSL-vs-native split to get wrong.

## Rule Of Thumb

Run `install-mcp` / `install-hooks` from the same shell that launches Claude
Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, or another agent — on macOS that is just your
normal Terminal.

- The agent runs as a native macOS process, so its config must point at a
  **host-reachable** server URL. Native installs and Docker-wrapper
  `install-mcp` / `install-hooks` commands render `http://127.0.0.1:49374`,
  which works from the host agent.
- Hooks are rendered for one of two platforms:
  - `posix-native` — a direct `ai-memory hook --event …` call. The default for
    native macOS/Linux Claude Code installs (cargo / release binary); it uses
    the local event spool + OIDC-token fallback.
  - `posix` — `sh` runs the bundled `.sh` script. The Docker wrapper's default.

  Set `AI_MEMORY_HOOK_PLATFORM` before wiring hooks to override the default.

## Scenario A: Prebuilt Release Binary (Recommended, No Toolchain)

Use this when you want a local server plus native hooks without a Rust toolchain
or Docker. Each tagged release publishes a macOS tarball per architecture.

```bash
# 1. Download the archive for your chip and extract it to a stable location.
#    aarch64 = Apple Silicon (M-series); x86_64 = Intel.
mkdir -p ~/Applications/ai-memory && cd ~/Applications/ai-memory
curl -fsSL -O https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory/releases/latest/download/ai-memory-macos-aarch64.tar.gz
tar -xzf ai-memory-macos-aarch64.tar.gz
# `curl` downloads are not Gatekeeper-quarantined, so the binary runs as-is.
# If you downloaded via a browser instead, clear the quarantine flag once:
#   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./ai-memory

# 2. Initialise the data dir (defaults to
#    ~/Library/Application Support/ai-memory; override with AI_MEMORY_DATA_DIR).
./ai-memory init

# 3. Start the server (loopback only).
./ai-memory serve --transport http --bind 127.0.0.1:49374
```

In a second terminal, wire the agent:

```bash
cd ~/Applications/ai-memory
# `install-hooks` auto-discovers the bundled hooks/ directory beside the binary.
./ai-memory install-hooks --agent claude-code --apply
./ai-memory install-mcp --client claude-code --apply
```

Notes:

- The MCP endpoint, capture hooks, and `ai-memory status` work without a token
  in this single-user loopback setup. If you explicitly configure
  `AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` for the server, pass the same token with `--auth-token`
  or export it for CLI commands.
- Keep the extracted `ai-memory` at a stable path; the hook commands reference
  it. Re-run `install-hooks` if you move it.

## Scenario B: Source Build

Use this when developing ai-memory itself. Requires Rust 1.95
(`rust-toolchain.toml`) plus the Xcode Command Line Tools
(`xcode-select --install`); SQLite is bundled and libgit2 is vendored, so no
extra system libraries are needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory
cd ai-memory
cargo build --release --workspace
./target/release/ai-memory init
./target/release/ai-memory serve --transport http --bind 127.0.0.1:49374
```

From another shell in the repo, `install-hooks` finds the bundled `hooks/`
automatically (no `--source` needed from the repo root):

```bash
./target/release/ai-memory install-hooks --agent claude-code --apply
./target/release/ai-memory install-mcp   --client claude-code --apply
```

## Scenario C: Docker Wrapper

Use this when you want the server data in a Docker volume while the agent still
runs as a native macOS process. The wrapper renders host-side agent config with
`http://127.0.0.1:49374`, but its own thin-client commands reach the server from
inside a helper container via Docker Desktop's `host.docker.internal` alias.

```bash
# Start the server. The image default allowlist includes host.docker.internal so
# wrapper thin-client commands (status, search, …) are not rejected with 403.
docker run -d --name ai-memory --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 127.0.0.1:49374:49374 -v ai-memory-data:/data \
    akitaonrails/ai-memory:latest

# Wire the native host agent. The wrapper keeps these rendered URLs on loopback.
ai-memory install-mcp   --client claude-code --apply
ai-memory install-hooks --agent  claude-code --apply
```

The published Docker image includes both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so
Apple Silicon pulls the native arm64 image without `--platform linux/amd64`.

## Hook Platform on macOS

`AI_MEMORY_HOOK_PLATFORM` selects how hook commands are rendered. On macOS the
two relevant values are `posix-native` (direct binary call; the native default)
and `posix` (the bundled `.sh` scripts; the Docker-wrapper default). Set it
before running `install-hooks` so the choice is baked into the rendered
commands. The native hook spools events locally, does short session-start
cleanup, and starts a detached session-end `hook-drain` helper; the whole-minute
spool-timing overrides are shared with Windows and documented in
[`docs/windows.md`](windows.md#tuning-the-spool-timings-high-latency-instances).

Native `posix-native` `ai-memory hook` commands enforce the nearest-marker
`[capture] ignore_paths` policy before spool or network delivery. The Docker
wrapper's `posix` shell-script path does not. Re-run `install-hooks --agent
<agent> --apply` after upgrading to refresh an existing native install; see
[Capture exclusions](marker-file.md#capture-exclusions).

## Troubleshooting on macOS

- **`403 forbidden host` from Docker-wrapper CLI commands:** update the Docker
  image and wrapper script. Current images allowlist `host.docker.internal` for
  loopback-published Docker Desktop servers.
- **Agent config points at `host.docker.internal`:** re-run `ai-memory
  install-mcp --client <client> --apply` and `ai-memory install-hooks --agent
  <agent> --apply` with the current wrapper. Host-side agent config should use
  `http://127.0.0.1:49374`.
- **Hooks bundle not found from a release archive:** ensure you extracted the
  whole tarball, not just the binary. Current `install-hooks` probes the sibling
  `hooks/` directory automatically.
- **Platform-mismatch warning on Apple Silicon:** update to a current Docker
  tag. Tagged releases publish a multi-arch manifest with `linux/arm64`.

## Suggested Test Checklist

1. `ai-memory serve --bind 127.0.0.1:49374` starts and logs `bind=127.0.0.1:49374`.
2. `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp` returns
   `405` (reachable; GET not allowed), confirming the loopback server is up.
3. `install-hooks --agent claude-code --apply` writes hook commands that
   reference `http://127.0.0.1:49374` and host-side paths.
4. `install-mcp --client claude-code` renders `http://127.0.0.1:49374/mcp`.
5. Launch the agent, call `memory_status`, send a prompt, then confirm capture
   (`ai-memory status` shows non-zero observations, or query the SQLite
   `observations` table).

Report which scenario you used, your chip (Apple Silicon / Intel), the agent and
version, and whether hooks executed or failed with a connect/resolve error.
