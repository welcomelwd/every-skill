## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.10+
- **Go**: 1.22+ (Required only for Go SDK development under `sdk/go`)
- **Rust**: 1.91.1+ (Required for source builds because the bundled `ov` CLI is built during packaging)
- **C++ Compiler**: GCC 9+ or Clang 11+ (Required for building core extensions, must support C++17)
- **CMake**: 3.15+

#### Platform-Specific Native Build Tools

- **Linux**: Install `build-essential`; some environments may also require `pkg-config`
- **macOS**: Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- **Windows**: Install CMake and MinGW for local native builds

#### Supported Platforms (Pre-compiled Wheels)

OpenViking provides pre-compiled **Wheel** packages for the following environments:

- **Windows**: x86_64
- **macOS**: x86_64, arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: x86_64, arm64 (manylinux)

For other platforms (e.g., FreeBSD), the package will be automatically compiled from source during installation via `pip`. Ensure you have the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed.

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/openviking.git
cd openviking
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We recommend using `uv` for Python environment management:

```bash
# Install uv (if not installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Sync dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync --all-extras
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

#### Local Development & Native Rebuilds

OpenViking defaults to `binding-client` mode for AGFS/RAGFS, which requires pre-built native artifacts. If you modify the **RAGFS Rust binding**, the bundled **Rust CLI**, or the **C++ extensions**, or if the pre-built artifacts are not found, you need to re-compile and re-install them. Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
uv pip install -e . --force-reinstall
```

This command ensures that `setup.py` is re-executed, triggering rebuilds for AGFS/RAGFS, the bundled `ov` CLI, and the C++ components.

### 3. Configure Environment

Run the interactive wizard to pick providers and write `~/.openviking/ov.conf`, then
validate the result:

```console
openviking-server init
openviking-server doctor
```

Manual `ov.conf` templates, per-provider examples, and environment variables are in the
[Configuration guide](https://docs.openviking.ai/en/guides/01-configuration). The default
config file is loaded automatically; set `OPENVIKING_CONFIG_FILE` only when using a
non-default path.

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import openviking; print(openviking.__version__)"
```

### 5. Build Rust CLI (Optional)

The Rust CLI (`ov`) provides a high-performance command-line client for interacting with OpenViking Server.

Even if you do not plan to use `ov` directly, the Rust toolchain is still required when building OpenViking from source because packaging also builds the bundled CLI binary.

```bash
# Build and install from source
cargo install --path crates/ov_cli

# Or install the published npm CLI package (downloads pre-built binary)
npm i -g @openviking/cli
```

After installation, run `ov --help` to see all available commands. CLI connection config goes in `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf`.

## Code Style

We use the following tools to maintain code consistency:

| Tool | Purpose | Config |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Ruff** | Linting, Formatting, Import sorting | `pyproject.toml` |
| **mypy** | Type checking | `pyproject.toml` |

### Running Checks

```bash
# Format code
ruff format openviking/

# Lint
ruff check openviking/

# Type check
mypy openviking/
```

### Style Guidelines

1. **Line width**: 100 characters
2. **Indentation**: 4 spaces
3. **Strings**: Prefer double quotes
4. **Type hints**: Encouraged but not required
5. **Docstrings**: Required for public APIs (1-2 lines max)

---

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test module
pytest tests/client/ -v
pytest tests/server/ -v
pytest tests/parse/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/client/test_http_client_config.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/client/test_http_client_config.py

# Run by keyword
pytest -k "search" -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=openviking --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Writing Tests

Tests are organized in subdirectories under `tests/`. The project uses `asyncio_mode = "auto"`, so async tests do **not** need the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator:

```python
# tests/service/test_example.py
class TestResourceService:
    async def test_add_resource(self, service, request_context, sample_markdown_file):
        result = await service.resources.add_resource(
            path=str(sample_markdown_file),
            ctx=request_context,
            reason="test document",
        )
        assert "root_uri" in result
        assert result["root_uri"].startswith("viking://")
```

Common fixtures are defined in `tests/conftest.py`, including the initialized `service`, `request_context`, `temp_dir`, and sample files.

## Maintainer Routing and Contribution Entry

### Contributor-Facing Module Map

If you are not sure where your question, issue, or PR belongs, start with this table:

| Domain | Area | Primary Contact |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Integration | Bot | `@yeshion23333` |
| Integration | OpenClaw Plugin | `@Mijamind719`, `@wlff123` |
| Platform | Framework / Multi-tenant / Resources / Session | `@qin-ctx` |
| Platform | Incremental / Scheduled Update | `@myysy` |
| Knowledge | Memory | `@chenjw` |
| Knowledge | Retrieval / Directory Semantics | `@zhoujh01` |
| Storage & Security | Virtual FS / File Encryption | `@chuanbao666`, `@baojun-zhang` |

If the area is still unclear, mention one of the cross-module maintainers listed below.

### Maintainer Routing Map

Use this table when routing issues, PRs, or design questions to a more specific owner:

| Domain | Subarea | Representative Paths or Topics | Primary Contact | Backup / Cross-Module |
|--------|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Integration | Bot Runtime | `bot/vikingbot`, `bot/bridge`, deployment scripts, bot docs | `@yeshion23333` | `@chenjw` |
| Integration | OpenClaw Plugin | `examples/openclaw-plugin`, installation, remote mode, compatibility | `@Mijamind719`, `@wlff123` | `@LinQiang391` |
| Platform | Server & Multi-tenant | `openviking/server`, `openviking/service`, auth, identity, admin, tenant boundary | `@qin-ctx` | `@MaojiaSheng` |
| Platform | Resource & Session Lifecycle | `openviking/resource`, `openviking/session`, resource ingestion, session lifecycle | `@qin-ctx` | `@MaojiaSheng` |
| Platform | Incremental & Scheduled Update | `openviking/resource/watch_manager.py`, `openviking/resource/watch_scheduler.py` | `@myysy` | `@qin-ctx` |
| Knowledge | Memory Engine | `openviking/session/memory`, `memory_extractor.py`, `memory_deduplicator.py` | `@chenjw` | `@qin-ctx` |
| Knowledge | Retrieval & Directory Semantics | `openviking/retrieve`, intent analysis, hierarchical retrieval, directory semantics | `@zhoujh01` | `@qin-ctx` |
| Storage & Security | VFS / AGFS Path Semantics | `openviking/storage`, `openviking/pyagfs`, filesystem behavior, path semantics | `@chuanbao666`, `@baojun-zhang` | `@zhoujh01` |
| Storage & Security | Encryption & Data Safety | `openviking/crypto`, file encryption, storage safety | `@chuanbao666`, `@baojun-zhang` | `@zhoujh01` |

For areas without a stable owner yet, cross-module maintainers will help route the request first.

### Cross-Module Maintainers

- `@MaojiaSheng`
- `@qin-ctx`
- `@zhoujh01`

Cross-module maintainers help with issue routing, cross-cutting design questions, and fallback review support.

### How to Ask for Help

- If you already know the affected module, mention it in the issue or PR description.
- If you are unsure about the module, describe the use case and affected behavior first.
- If you want to work on an issue, leave a comment before starting, especially for cross-module changes.
- If your PR spans multiple areas, call out the primary affected domain in the description.

### Contribution Entry Labels

Issue templates already classify reports such as `bug`, `enhancement`, and `question`. Maintainers may also use the following labels to make contribution entry clearer:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `good first issue` | Newcomer-friendly work with clear scope and acceptance criteria |
| `help wanted` | Tasks that benefit from contributors who already know the codebase or review style |
| `needs-design` | Work that needs maintainer clarification before implementation |
| `needs-review` | Pull requests waiting for the first review round |

### Contributor Growth Path

The project uses a practical contribution path so contributors can see what “next step” looks like:

| Stage | Typical Signals | Common Next Step |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| New Contributor | First issue or first PR, often docs, tests, or scoped fixes | Start with `good first issue` items and get familiar with local workflow |
| Active Contributor | One or more merged contributions | Pick up `help wanted` work in an area you already touched |
| Module Contributor | Repeated contributions in the same subarea | Help with triage, reproduction, docs, or review comments in that area |
| Backup Reviewer Candidate | Stable contribution record in one subarea | Help with first-pass review, routing, and contributor support |

## CI/CD Workflows

We use **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Our workflows are designed to be modular and tiered.

### 1. Automatic Workflows

| Event | Workflow | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Pull Request** | `pr.yml` | Runs **Lint** (Ruff, Mypy) and **Test Lite** (Integration tests on Linux + Python 3.10). Provides fast feedback for contributors. (Displayed as **01. Pull Request Checks**) |
| **Push to Main** | `ci.yml` | Runs **Test Full** (All OS: Linux/Win/Mac, All Py versions: 3.10-3.14) and **CodeQL** (Security scan). Ensures main branch stability. (Displayed as **02. Main Branch Checks**) |
| **Release Published** | `release.yml` | Triggered when you create a Release on GitHub. Automatically builds source distribution and wheels, determines version from Git Tag, and publishes to **PyPI**. (Displayed as **03. Release**) |
| **Weekly Cron** | `schedule.yml` | Runs **CodeQL** security scan every Sunday. (Displayed as **04. Weekly Security Scan**) |

Other repository workflows also exist for PR review automation, Docker image builds, and Rust CLI packaging.

### 2. Manual Trigger Workflows

Maintainers can manually trigger the following workflows from the "Actions" tab to perform specific tasks or debug issues.

#### A. Test Suite (Lite) (`12. _Test Suite (Lite)`)
Runs fast integration tests, supports custom matrix configuration.

*   **Inputs**:
    *   `os_json`: JSON string array of OS to run on (e.g., `["ubuntu-24.04"]`).
    *   `python_json`: JSON string array of Python versions (e.g., `["3.10"]`).

#### B. Test Suite (Full) (`13. _Test Suite (Full)`)
Runs the full test suite on all supported platforms (Linux/Mac/Win) and Python versions (3.10-3.14). Supports custom matrix configuration when triggered manually.

*   **Inputs**:
    *   `os_json`: List of OS to run on (Default: `["ubuntu-24.04", "macos-14", "windows-latest"]`).
    *   `python_json`: List of Python versions (Default: `["3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13", "3.14"]`).

#### C. Security Scan (`14. _CodeQL Scan`)
Runs CodeQL security analysis. No arguments required.

#### D. Build Distribution (`15. _Build Distribution`)
Builds Python wheel packages only, does not publish.

*   **Inputs**:
    *   `os_json`: List of OS to build on (Default: `["ubuntu-24.04", "ubuntu-24.04-arm", "macos-14", "macos-15-intel", "windows-latest"]`).
    *   `python_json`: List of Python versions (Default: `["3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13", "3.14"]`).
    *   `build_sdist`: Whether to build source distribution (Default: `true`).
    *   `build_wheels`: Whether to build wheel distribution (Default: `true`).

#### E. Publish Distribution (`16. _Publish Distribution`)
Publishes built packages (requires build Run ID) to PyPI.

*   **Inputs**:
    *   `target`: Select publish target (`testpypi`, `pypi`, `both`).
    *   `build_run_id`: Build Workflow Run ID (Required, get it from the Build run URL).

#### F. Manual Release (`03. Release`)
One-stop build and publish (includes build and publish steps).

> **Version Numbering & Tag Convention**:
> This project uses `setuptools_scm` to automatically extract version numbers from Git Tags.
> *   **Tag Naming Convention**: Must follow the `vX.Y.Z` format (e.g., `v0.1.0`, `v1.2.3`). Tags must be compliant with Semantic Versioning.
> *   **Release Build**: When a Release event is triggered, the version number directly corresponds to the Git Tag (e.g., `v0.1.0` -> `0.1.0`).
> *   **Manual/Non-Tag Build**: The version number will include the commit count since the last Tag (e.g., `0.1.1.dev3`).
> *   **Confirm Version**: After the publish job completes, you can see the published version directly in the **Notifications** area at the top of the Workflow **Summary** page (e.g., `Successfully published to PyPI with version: 0.1.8`). You can also verify it in the logs or the **Artifacts** filenames.

*   **Inputs**:
    *   `target`: Select publish target.
        *   `none`: Build artifacts only (no publish). Used for verifying build capability.
        *   `testpypi`: Publish to TestPyPI. Used for Beta testing.
        *   `pypi`: Publish to official PyPI.
        *   `both`: Publish to both.
    *   `os_json`: Build platforms (Default includes all).
    *   `python_json`: Python versions (Default includes all).
    *   `build_sdist`: Whether to build source distribution (Default: `true`).
    *   `build_wheels`: Whether to build wheel distribution (Default: `true`).

> **Publishing Notes**:
> *   **Test First**: It is strongly recommended to publish to **TestPyPI** for verification before publishing to official PyPI. Note that PyPI and TestPyPI are completely independent environments, and accounts and package data are not shared.
> *   **No Overwrites**: Neither PyPI nor TestPyPI allow overwriting existing packages with the same name and version. If you need to republish, you must upgrade the version number (e.g., tag a new version or generate a new dev version). If you try to publish an existing version, the workflow will fail.
