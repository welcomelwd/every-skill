# Common Tools

Pydantic AI ships with native tools that can be used to enhance your agent's capabilities.

## DuckDuckGo Search Tool

The DuckDuckGo search tool allows you to search the web for information. It is built on top of the
[DuckDuckGo API](https://github.com/deedy5/ddgs).

### Installation

To use [`duckduckgo_search_tool`][pydantic_ai.common_tools.duckduckgo.duckduckgo_search_tool], you need to install
[`pydantic-ai-slim`](install.md#slim-install) with the `duckduckgo` optional group:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-slim[duckduckgo]"
```

### Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the DuckDuckGo search tool with an agent:

```py {title="duckduckgo_search.py" test="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.common_tools.duckduckgo import duckduckgo_search_tool

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    tools=[duckduckgo_search_tool()],
    instructions='Search DuckDuckGo for the given query and return the results.',
)

result = agent.run_sync(
    'Can you list the top five highest-grossing animated films of 2025?'
)
print(result.output)
"""
I looked into several sources on animated box‐office performance in 2025, and while detailed
rankings can shift as more money is tallied, multiple independent reports have already
highlighted a couple of record‐breaking shows. For example:

• Ne Zha 2 – News outlets (Variety, Wikipedia's "List of animated feature films of 2025", and others)
    have reported that this Chinese title not only became the highest‑grossing animated film of 2025
    but also broke records as the highest‑grossing non‑English animated film ever. One article noted
    its run exceeded US$1.7 billion.
• Inside Out 2 – According to data shared on Statista and in industry news, this Pixar sequel has been
    on pace to set new records (with some sources even noting it as the highest‑grossing animated film
    ever, as of January 2025).

Beyond those two, some entertainment trade sites (for example, a Just Jared article titled
"Top 10 Highest-Earning Animated Films at the Box Office Revealed") have begun listing a broader
top‑10. Although full consolidated figures can sometimes differ by source and are updated daily during
a box‑office run, many of the industry trackers have begun to single out five films as the biggest
earners so far in 2025.

Unfortunately, although multiple articles discuss the "top animated films" of 2025, there isn't yet a
single, universally accepted list with final numbers that names the complete top five. (Box‑office
rankings, especially mid‑year, can be fluid as films continue to add to their totals.)

Based on what several sources note so far, the two undisputed leaders are:
1. Ne Zha 2
2. Inside Out 2

The remaining top spots (3–5) are reported by some outlets in their "Top‑10 Animated Films"
lists for 2025 but the titles and order can vary depending on the source and the exact cut‑off
date of the data. For the most up‑to‑date and detailed ranking (including the 3rd, 4th, and 5th
highest‑grossing films), I recommend checking resources like:
• Wikipedia's "List of animated feature films of 2025" page
• Box‑office tracking sites (such as Box Office Mojo or The Numbers)
• Trade articles like the one on Just Jared

To summarize with what is clear from the current reporting:
1. Ne Zha 2
2. Inside Out 2
3–5. Other animated films (yet to be definitively finalized across all reporting outlets)

If you're looking for a final, consensus list of the top five, it may be best to wait until
the 2025 year‑end box‑office tallies are in or to consult a regularly updated entertainment industry source.

Would you like help finding a current source or additional details on where to look for the complete updated list?

## Web Fetch Tool

The web fetch tool allows your agent to fetch the content of web pages and convert them to markdown.
It uses [SSRF protection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery) to prevent server-side request forgery attacks.

### Installation

To use [`web_fetch_tool`][pydantic_ai.common_tools.web_fetch.web_fetch_tool], you need to install
[`pydantic-ai-slim`](install.md#slim-install) with the `web-fetch` optional group:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-slim[web-fetch]"
```

### Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the web fetch tool with an agent:

```py {title="web_fetch.py" test="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.common_tools.web_fetch import web_fetch_tool

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    tools=[web_fetch_tool()],
    instructions='Fetch web pages and summarize their content.',
)

result = agent.run_sync('What is on https://ai.pydantic.dev?')
print(result.output)
```

!!! tip "Automatic fallback via WebFetch capability"
    You don't need to use [`web_fetch_tool`][pydantic_ai.common_tools.web_fetch.web_fetch_tool] directly — the
    [`WebFetch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebFetch] capability automatically uses it
    as a local fallback when the model doesn't support native URL fetching.

By default the tool caps returned text at 50,000 characters (`max_content_length`) and caps the
downloaded response body at 50 MiB (`max_download_bytes`). Pass `None` for either to disable that limit.

!!! warning "Credentials in `headers`"
    Headers configured via `web_fetch_tool(headers=...)` are sent to whatever URL the model requests,
    since the model chooses the URL. If you configure a credential like `Authorization`, use
    `allowed_domains` to restrict which hosts can receive it, and keep in mind that domain filters
    match the hostname only: the model can still direct the credential to plain `http://` or to a
    non-standard port on an allowed host. On redirects, configured sensitive headers
    (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorization`) are only forwarded when the redirect stays
    on the same origin (scheme, host, and port) or upgrades from `http` to `https` on the same host
    on the default ports; they are stripped on any other redirect.

## Tavily Search Tool

!!! info
    Tavily is a paid service, but they have free credits to explore their product.

    You need to [sign up for an account](https://app.tavily.com/home) and get an API key to use the Tavily search tool.

The Tavily search tool allows you to search the web for information. It is built on top of the [Tavily API](https://tavily.com/).

### Installation

To use [`tavily_search_tool`][pydantic_ai.common_tools.tavily.tavily_search_tool], you need to install
[`pydantic-ai-slim`](install.md#slim-install) with the `tavily` optional group:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-slim[tavily]"
```

### Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the Tavily search tool with an agent:

```py {title="tavily_search.py" test="skip"}
import os

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.common_tools.tavily import tavily_search_tool

api_key = os.getenv('TAVILY_API_KEY')
assert api_key is not None

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    tools=[tavily_search_tool(api_key)],
    instructions='Search Tavily for the given query and return the results.',
)

result = agent.run_sync('Tell me the top news in the GenAI world, give me links.')
print(result.output)
"""

### Configuring Parameters

The `tavily_search_tool` factory accepts optional parameters that control search behavior. `max_results` is always developer-controlled and never appears in the LLM tool schema. Other parameters, when provided, are fixed for all searches and hidden from the LLM's tool schema. Parameters left unset remain available for the LLM to set per-call.

For example, you can lock in `max_results` and `include_domains` at tool creation time while still letting the LLM control `exclude_domains`:

```py {title="tavily_domain_filtering.py"}
import os

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.common_tools.tavily import tavily_search_tool

api_key = os.getenv('TAVILY_API_KEY')
assert api_key is not None

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    tools=[tavily_search_tool(api_key, max_results=5, include_domains=['arxiv.org'])],
    instructions='Search for information and return the results.',
)

result = agent.run_sync(
    'Find recent papers about transformer architectures'
)
print(result.output)
"""
Here are some recent papers about transformer architectures from arxiv.org:

1. "Attention Is All You Need" - The foundational paper on the Transformer model.
2. "FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention" - Proposes an IO-aware attention algorithm.

## Exa Search Tool

!!! warning "Deprecated"
    The Exa common tools (`exa_search_tool`, `exa_find_similar_tool`, `exa_get_contents_tool`, `exa_answer_tool`, and `ExaToolset`) are deprecated and will be removed in v3.

    Use the [`ExaSearch`](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/exa-search/) capability from the Pydantic AI Harness instead, which bundles web search, full-page retrieval, deep search, and an `ExaAgent` capability for long-running research:

    ```bash
    pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-harness[exa]"
    ```

    ```py {title="exa_search.py" test="skip"}
    from pydantic_ai_harness.exa import ExaSearch

    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', capabilities=[ExaSearch()])

    result = agent.run_sync('What are the latest developments in quantum computing?')
    print(result.output)
    ```
