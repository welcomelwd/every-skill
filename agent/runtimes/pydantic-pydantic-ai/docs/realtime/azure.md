# Azure Realtime

[`AzureRealtimeModel`][pydantic_ai.realtime.azure.AzureRealtimeModel] connects to Azure's realtime
speech-to-speech with the server-side Pydantic AI agent loop — either the **Azure OpenAI GA** protocol
(the default) or **Azure AI Voice Live** (opt-in). Start with the
[realtime quickstart](overview.md#quickstart) or [text-to-audio example](../examples/realtime-text-to-audio.md).

## Setup

Azure OpenAI realtime uses the OpenAI realtime stack, so install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the
`openai-realtime` optional group:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-slim[openai-realtime]"
```

Set `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` as for the
[Azure AI Foundry provider](../models/openai.md#azure-ai-foundry). Use the `azure:` prefix followed
by your Azure deployment name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(instructions='You are a helpful voice assistant.')


async def main():
    async with agent.realtime('azure:my-realtime-deployment').session() as session:
        await session.send('Say hello.')

        async for part in session.stream_transcripts():
            print(f'{part.speaker}: {part.transcript}')
            #> assistant: Hello from the realtime assistant.
            if part.speaker == 'assistant':
                break  # keep listening in a real call; we stop after one reply
```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" — you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_

For explicit configuration, use
[`AzureProvider.for_realtime()`][pydantic_ai.providers.azure.AzureProvider.for_realtime]. It accepts
a bare resource endpoint or its `/openai/v1` form. The GA realtime protocol uses `/openai/v1/realtime`
and does not take an `api_version`. Requests authenticate with the resource API key by default, or
with a Microsoft Entra ID token when a `credential` is passed (see
[Browser WebRTC and Microsoft Entra ID](#browser-webrtc-and-microsoft-entra-id)).

## Model names

Pass the Azure **deployment name**, which is chosen when the model is deployed and need not match
the underlying model ID. Available realtime models and regions are documented in the
[Azure OpenAI realtime documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/realtime-audio-quickstart).

## Settings

Azure uses
[`OpenAIRealtimeModelSettings`][pydantic_ai.realtime.openai.OpenAIRealtimeModelSettings] — the
realtime counterpart of [model run settings](../agent.md#model-run-settings) — including the
[shared settings](overview.md#shared-settings) plus:

- `openai_voice` for the provider voice;
- `openai_input_noise_reduction` and `openai_output_speed`;
- `openai_turn_detection` for server or semantic VAD (see [turn detection](turns.md#automatic-turn-detection));
- `openai_truncation` for session context management.

See [OpenAI settings](openai.md#settings) for the shared settings. Azure realtime does not
expose `temperature` through Pydantic AI.

### Input transcription deployment

Azure resolves the [`input_transcription_model`](audio.md#input-transcription) setting against
deployments in your resource. The default `'auto'` selects `gpt-realtime-whisper`; a resource
without a matching deployment emits a `DeploymentNotFound` transcription error on every turn.

Deploy a realtime-capable transcription model such as `gpt-realtime-whisper` or
`gpt-4o-transcribe`, then set `input_transcription_model` to that deployment name. A classic
`whisper` deployment is not accepted. Set the field to `None` to disable transcription and use
[`audio_retention='input_audio'`](history.md#retaining-audio) if the spoken turn must remain
available as audio.

## Browser WebRTC and Microsoft Entra ID

Azure OpenAI supports the same browser WebRTC flow as OpenAI — the audio flows browser ↔ Azure directly
while your backend runs a control-plane **sideband**. See [Connecting a frontend](deployment.md#browser-webrtc-server-sideband)
for the topology, and use
[`AgentRealtime.answer_webrtc_offer`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRealtime.answer_webrtc_offer] /
[`AgentRealtime.create_client_secret`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRealtime.create_client_secret] exactly as on OpenAI.
Azure relays the offer with `webrtcfilter=on`, which limits the events forwarded to the browser to a
safe subset so the session instructions stay on the server's control connection.

!!! note "Capturing sideband transcripts needs a deployed transcription model"
    The server side of a WebRTC call never receives the user's audio (it flows browser ↔ Azure
    directly), so the only way to capture the *words* the user speaks is a transcription model — the
    `audio_retention='input_audio'` fallback can't apply (there's no audio to retain). Without one, the
    user's turns are still represented in history, but as content-less
    [`SpeechPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.SpeechPart]s. To capture what users say, deploy a transcription
    model on your Azure resource (the default `gpt-realtime-whisper` fails with `DeploymentNotFound`
    until you deploy it, or point `input_transcription_model` at a transcription deployment you have).

!!! note "The browser's filtered event stream differs from the raw protocol"
    `webrtcfilter=on` means the events Azure forwards over the browser's data channel are a privacy-safe
    subset: the browser sees `output_audio_buffer.started` / `output_audio_buffer.stopped` for
    speaking-state, not the raw `response.created` / `response.done`. A frontend that keys "assistant is
    speaking" or latency telemetry off `response.*` needs to map the `output_audio_buffer.*` events
    instead. This affects only client code reading the data channel directly; the server-side session's
    [event stream](events.md) is unaffected — verified live: the session receives the
    `output_audio_buffer.*` frames in full and reports them as
    [`RealtimeOutputSpeechStartEvent`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeOutputSpeechStartEvent] /
    [`RealtimeOutputSpeechEndEvent`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeOutputSpeechEndEvent], so a
    listening/speaking indicator can be driven from the server rather than reconstructed in the browser
    (see [Connecting a frontend](deployment.md#browser-webrtc-server-sideband)).

Azure requests authenticate with the resource's API key by default. To use **Microsoft Entra ID**
instead — so no API key is involved, e.g. when the resource is locked to managed identity — pass a
`credential` (any [`azure.identity`](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)
credential, e.g. `DefaultAzureCredential`). It authenticates **every** request to the resource — the
realtime WebSocket session and the WebRTC signaling — with a bearer token for the Azure OpenAI data
plane (scope `https://ai.azure.com/.default`), which requires the **Cognitive Services User** role on
the resource:

```python {test="skip"}
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

from pydantic_ai.providers.azure import AzureProvider
from pydantic_ai.realtime.azure import AzureRealtimeModel

model = AzureRealtimeModel(
    'gpt-realtime',
    # `entra_authenticated=True` so no resource key is required — a resource locked to managed
    # identity has none. Omit `provider=` entirely to take the endpoint from `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.
    provider=AzureProvider.for_realtime(
        azure_endpoint='https://my-resource.openai.azure.com', entra_authenticated=True
    ),
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)
# The realtime session, `answer_webrtc_offer`, and `create_client_secret` now authenticate with an Entra
# bearer token; the browser only ever receives the short-lived ephemeral secret, never it or the API key.
```

## Azure AI Voice Live

[Azure AI Voice Live](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live) is
Microsoft's managed speech-to-speech service, with extra session options and a wider model catalog than
the GA realtime API — including cascade pipelines (Azure speech-to-text → a chat model → Azure
text-to-speech) over models like `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1`, and `gpt-5`. It's the **same
[`AzureRealtimeModel`][pydantic_ai.realtime.azure.AzureRealtimeModel]**: set
[`azure_voice_live=True`][pydantic_ai.realtime.azure.AzureRealtimeModelSettings.azure_voice_live] and the
model targets the Voice Live endpoint and beta session protocol.

Voice Live is a distinct Azure resource with its own credentials, so set `AZURE_VOICELIVE_ENDPOINT`,
`AZURE_VOICELIVE_API_KEY`, and `AZURE_VOICELIVE_API_VERSION`, or pass `voice_live_endpoint`,
`voice_live_api_key`, and `voice_live_api_version` to
[`AzureProvider`][pydantic_ai.providers.azure.AzureProvider]. Each value resolves explicit argument
first, then its own `AZURE_VOICELIVE_*` variable, then the Azure OpenAI endpoint/key — so a Voice Live
user who only has one resource doesn't need to configure both, and one who has both never gets a
mixture of the two.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.providers.azure import AzureProvider
from pydantic_ai.realtime.azure import AzureRealtimeModel, AzureRealtimeModelSettings

provider = AzureProvider(
    voice_live_endpoint='https://my-voice-live.services.ai.azure.com',
    voice_live_api_key='...',
    voice_live_api_version='2026-04-10',
)

agent = Agent(instructions='You are a helpful voice assistant.')
# Pass the Voice Live `provider`, and set `azure_voice_live` on the model rather than per session so
# `model.profile` reflects Voice Live (see the note below).
model = AzureRealtimeModel(
    'gpt-realtime', provider=provider, settings=AzureRealtimeModelSettings(azure_voice_live=True)
)


async def main():
    async with agent.realtime(model).session() as session:
        await session.send('Say hello.')
        async for event in session:
            ...
```

Voice-Live-only knobs use the `azure_voice_live_*` prefix (e.g.
[`azure_voice_live_turn_detection`][pydantic_ai.realtime.azure.AzureRealtimeModelSettings.azure_voice_live_turn_detection]).

### Which models use which API

`azure_voice_live` isn't always needed: `AzureRealtimeModel` routes by model. The two APIs overlap but
neither contains the other, so each recognized model is served by the GA realtime API, by Voice Live, or
by both:

- **Both** (e.g. `gpt-realtime`, `gpt-realtime-mini`) — default to GA;
  `azure_voice_live=True` selects Voice Live.
- **Voice Live only** (e.g. `gpt-5` and the other cascade chat models, `phi4-mm-realtime`) — routed to
  Voice Live automatically, with or without the setting.
- **GA only** (e.g. `gpt-realtime-2`, `gpt-4o-realtime-preview`) — `azure_voice_live=True` raises a
  [`UserError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError], since Voice Live doesn't serve them.

An unrecognized model (a future release, or a deployment named after something else) defaults to GA and
reaches Voice Live only with `azure_voice_live=True`. When a deployment's name doesn't match its model,
pass a [`profile=`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeModel.profile]
[`AzureRealtimeModelProfile`][pydantic_ai.realtime.azure.AzureRealtimeModelProfile] with
[`azure_realtime_apis`][pydantic_ai.realtime.azure.AzureRealtimeModelProfile.azure_realtime_apis] to
correct the routing:

```python
from pydantic_ai.providers.azure import AzureProvider
from pydantic_ai.realtime.azure import AzureRealtimeModel, AzureRealtimeModelProfile

# A Voice-Live-only model deployed under a custom name.
model = AzureRealtimeModel(
    'my-voice-bot',
    provider=AzureProvider(
        voice_live_endpoint='https://my-voice-live.services.ai.azure.com', voice_live_api_key='...'
    ),
    profile=AzureRealtimeModelProfile(azure_realtime_apis=frozenset({'voice_live'})),
)
```

!!! note "Browser WebRTC is WebSocket-only for Voice Live"
    The [browser WebRTC](#browser-webrtc-and-microsoft-entra-id) flow above is for the GA Azure OpenAI
    realtime path. Voice Live negotiates WebRTC over its own WebSocket control channel instead, which
    isn't implemented yet, so `answer_webrtc_offer` / `create_client_secret` raise `UserError` whenever
    the session resolves to Voice Live — set with `azure_voice_live=True`, or auto-routed because the
    model is only served by Voice Live (e.g. `gpt-5`). Use a WebSocket session with Voice Live for now
    ([issue #6702](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/6702)).

    [`supports_webrtc`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeModelProfile.supports_webrtc] reports `False`
    whenever the **model** resolves to Voice Live — forced by `azure_voice_live=True` at construction, or
    auto-routed for a Voice-Live-only model.
    [`profile`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeModel.profile] is a property of the model and cannot see
    `model_settings` passed per session, so a per-session `azure_voice_live=True` on an otherwise-GA
    model isn't reflected in the flag. The signaling methods still refuse at the point of use in that
    case, so the flag is an early check and the point-of-use guard is the safety net.

## Provider-specific quirks

- A failed input transcription leaves the user turn represented as
  [retained audio](history.md#retaining-audio) when available, or as a content-less `SpeechPart`
  otherwise.
- Azure AI Voice Live rides the same model behind `azure_voice_live=True`, against its own
  resource and beta session protocol; browser WebRTC is GA-only for now.
