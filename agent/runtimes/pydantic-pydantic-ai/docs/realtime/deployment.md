# Connecting a frontend

Keep provider keys, tools, and business logic on the server; connect user devices to your backend,
not straight to the provider. How audio travels between the device and the model depends on the
client and the provider:

- **[Browser WebRTC + server sideband](#browser-webrtc-server-sideband)** — the recommended browser
  path on OpenAI and Azure OpenAI: the browser exchanges media directly with the provider (lowest
  latency) while your backend runs the agent over a control-plane sideband.
- **[Browser → backend WebSocket relay](#browser-backend-websocket-relay)** — works with every
  provider, including Gemini Live and xAI: the browser streams audio to your backend, which owns the
  media bridge.
- **[SIP / telephony bridge](#siptelephony-bridge)** — for phone calls, via a telephony provider.

In every shape the session — with its [tools](tools.md), [history](history.md), and
[usage limits](observability.md#usage-and-limits) — runs on your backend. Wiring a browser straight
to the provider with the provider's own SDK instead moves the agent loop into the client and gives
up all of that; prefer the shapes above.

## Browser WebRTC + server sideband

For browser voice agents on OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, the browser carries microphone and speaker
audio directly over WebRTC while the backend attaches a control-plane **sideband** to the same call.
Media never touches your backend, so latency stays low, while tools, history, dependencies, and
provider credentials stay on the server. Gemini Live and xAI do not offer this sideband transport —
use the [WebSocket relay](#browser-backend-websocket-relay) there.

```text
browser ── WebRTC media ── provider
   │                         ▲
   └─ SDP offer → backend ───┘ sideband identified by call_id
```

Relay the browser's offer with
[`AgentRealtime.answer_webrtc_offer`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRealtime.answer_webrtc_offer], return
the SDP answer to the browser, then attach the returned call handle:

```python
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(instructions='You are a concise voice assistant.')
realtime = agent.realtime('openai:gpt-realtime')


async def handle_offer(sdp_offer: str) -> str:
    answer = await realtime.answer_webrtc_offer(sdp_offer)

    async def run_sideband() -> None:
        async with realtime.session(provider_session=answer.session) as session:
            async for event in session:
                print(event)

    asyncio.create_task(run_sideband())
    return answer.sdp
```

The secure offer-relay flow never gives the browser a token. As an alternative,
[`AgentRealtime.create_client_secret`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRealtime.create_client_secret] mints a
short-lived credential for client-led negotiation. Either way the browser is a peer on the provider
session and can send provider-native control events, so authorize every server-side tool against
trusted [`deps`](../dependencies.md), not session instructions supplied to the model.

!!! warning "The browser can read seeded history"
    Seeding a sideband session with [`message_history`](history.md) sends those prior turns into the
    **shared** provider conversation that the browser is a peer on, so a call participant can read
    them — including confidential tool results — over the data channel (Azure's `webrtcfilter=on`
    still forwards conversation-item events). Only seed a sideband with history that is safe for the
    browser to see; keep confidential context in [`deps`](../dependencies.md) and tool logic instead.

A sideband does not own the audio transport: its `send_audio()`, `commit_audio()`, `clear_audio()`,
and `stream_audio()` methods raise, and `audio_retention` must remain `'transcript_only'`. Enable
[input transcription](audio.md#input-transcription) when user speech must appear in history, and use
[`RealtimeOutputSpeechStartEvent`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeOutputSpeechStartEvent] /
[`RealtimeOutputSpeechEndEvent`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeOutputSpeechEndEvent] for speaking
indicators — [`interrupt()`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeSession.interrupt] clears the provider's
outbound WebRTC audio buffer so [barge-in](turns.md#barge-in) stops playback. A
dropped sideband follows the same [reconnect](lifecycle.md#reconnecting) rules, with one wrinkle
covered there: a clean close is treated as the browser hanging up.

The [realtime WebRTC example](../examples/realtime-webrtc.md) demonstrates the full FastAPI and
browser flow. Provider-specific setup (Azure's Microsoft Entra ID and `webrtcfilter`) lives on the
[Azure](azure.md#browser-webrtc-and-microsoft-entra-id) page.

## Browser → backend WebSocket relay

When the browser can't use WebRTC — or the provider is Gemini Live or xAI — build a WebSocket
endpoint on your backend that accepts the browser's microphone audio and pumps it into
[`send_audio()`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeSession.send_audio], while relaying
[`stream_audio()`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeSession.stream_audio] output back for playback. Here
the backend owns the media bridge. The [realtime camera example](../examples/realtime-camera.md)
demonstrates this shape end to end; a minimal FastAPI relay — the browser sends raw PCM16 binary
frames and plays the frames it receives — is:

```python
import asyncio

from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket

from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent(instructions='You are a helpful voice assistant.')
app = FastAPI()


@app.websocket('/voice')
async def voice_socket(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    async with agent.realtime('openai:gpt-realtime').session() as session:

        async def pump_input():
            while True:
                await session.send_audio(await websocket.receive_bytes())

        input_task = asyncio.create_task(pump_input())
        try:
            async for chunk in session.stream_audio():
                await websocket.send_bytes(chunk)
        finally:
            input_task.cancel()
```

## SIP/telephony bridge

Terminate the phone call with a telephony provider such as Twilio, then build the service that
connects its media stream (e.g. Twilio Media Streams over WebSocket) to the backend session,
transcoding between the line's codec and PCM16.
