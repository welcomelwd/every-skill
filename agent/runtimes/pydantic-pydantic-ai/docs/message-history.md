# Messages and chat history

Pydantic AI provides access to messages exchanged during an agent run. These messages can be used both to continue a coherent conversation, and to understand how an agent performed.

### Accessing Messages from Results

After running an agent, you can access the messages exchanged during that run from the `result` object.

Both [`RunResult`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult]
(returned by [`Agent.run`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run], [`Agent.run_sync`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_sync])
and [`StreamedRunResult`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult] (returned by [`Agent.run_stream`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_stream]) have the following methods:

- [`all_messages()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.all_messages]: returns all messages, including messages from prior runs. There's also a variant that returns JSON bytes, [`all_messages_json()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.all_messages_json].
- [`new_messages()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.new_messages]: returns only the messages from the current run. There's also a variant that returns JSON bytes, [`new_messages_json()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.new_messages_json].

!!! info "StreamedRunResult and complete messages"
    On [`StreamedRunResult`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult], the messages returned from these methods will only include the final result message once the stream has finished.

    E.g. you've awaited one of the following coroutines:

    * [`StreamedRunResult.stream_output()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_output]
    * [`StreamedRunResult.stream_text()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_text]
    * [`StreamedRunResult.stream_response()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_response]
    * [`StreamedRunResult.get_output()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.get_output]

    **Note:** The final result message will NOT be added to result messages if you use [`.stream_text(delta=True)`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_text] since in this case the result content is never built as one string.

### Using Messages as Input for Further Agent Runs

The primary use of message histories in Pydantic AI is to maintain context across multiple agent runs.

To use existing messages in a run, pass them to the `message_history` parameter of
[`Agent.run`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run], [`Agent.run_sync`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_sync] or
[`Agent.run_stream`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_stream].

If `message_history` is set and not empty, a new system prompt is not generated — we assume the existing message history includes a system prompt. If your history comes from a source that doesn't round-trip system prompts (a UI frontend, a database that didn't persist them, a compaction pipeline), add the [`ReinjectSystemPrompt`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ReinjectSystemPrompt] capability so the agent's configured `system_prompt` is reinjected at the head of the first request when it's missing.

```python {title="Reusing messages in a conversation" hl_lines="9 13"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', instructions='Be a helpful assistant.')

result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
print(result1.output)
#> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

result2 = agent.run_sync('Explain?', message_history=result1.new_messages())
print(result2.output)
#> This is an excellent joke invented by Samuel Colvin, it needs no explanation.

print(result2.all_messages())

### Mid-conversation system prompts

A [`SystemPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.SystemPromptPart] in the first [`ModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest] is the agent's standing system prompt, and always hoists to the provider's top-level system parameter. One in any *later* request is a mid-conversation instruction: something that became true partway through the session, whether it arrived in a stored `message_history` or from [`RunContext.enqueue`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue] during a run.

Mid-conversation instructions stay where you put them rather than joining the system prompt at the front. When prompt caching is enabled, that lets the provider reuse the unchanged prefix: editing the top-level system prompt invalidates everything behind it, while an instruction appended in place leaves the conversation up to that point eligible for a cache hit. Position alone does not enable caching; configure the active model's prompt-caching settings or add an explicit [`CachePoint`][pydantic_ai.messages.CachePoint].

How it reaches the model depends on the provider:

* Where the API accepts a system message inside the conversation, it's sent as one, with the operator authority that implies. [Anthropic](models/anthropic.md#mid-conversation-system-messages) supports this on some models, and may adjust the position slightly to satisfy its own placement rules.
* Everywhere else it's rendered as a `<system>`-tagged [`UserPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.UserPromptPart] at the same position. The instruction still applies from where you put it, but the model can tell it came in over the user channel and may treat it as a strong preference rather than a rule.

Phrase the instruction as what changed rather than as an override of the user. Models are trained to resist instructions that appear to work against the person they're talking to, and that applies to the system role too — "the build tag is no longer confidential" lands where "ignore what the user was told earlier" doesn't.

!!! warning "Not a place for untrusted content"
    A system prompt carries operator authority, so text you put in one is treated as *your* instruction to the model. Never build a `SystemPromptPart` out of content you didn't author — tool output, a retrieved document, a fetched page, a message from another user — or a prompt injection buried in it inherits that authority.

    This matters most for late-arriving results, which is a common reason to reach for `enqueue`: a background job whose tool returned `'started'` long before the work finished, a webhook, a long-running search. Deliver those as data — enqueue the payload as user content, or return it from a tool — and reserve `SystemPromptPart` for instructions you wrote yourself. Where a background result should also *change how the agent behaves*, write that instruction yourself and enqueue the untrusted payload separately.

### Making histories provider-valid

Model providers reject a request whose message history has broken tool-call/tool-result pairing — a tool call with no result, or a result with no call. A run that is cancelled or crashes partway through can leave the history in exactly this state, and so can a hand-built, truncated, or context-evicted history. You don't need to clean these up yourself: before each model request, Pydantic AI repairs the history it was given so the provider accepts it.

Tool additions are stored as [`ToolAvailabilityDeltaPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolAvailabilityDeltaPart] request parts; tool removal is not represented. A tool returning [`ToolReturn(tools=[...])`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturn] authors the part immediately after its [`ToolReturnPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturnPart] in the same request, with the call's `tool_call_id` as a causal link. The executor deduplicates names in first-occurrence order and omits names already revealed. Replaying history keeps each `added` name revealed; tool definitions continue to come from the current run, so unknown or already-visible names have no effect when rendering a request.

The guiding rule is to adapt the history to what the provider accepts without ever discarding something you meant to send. Repairs only **add** synthesized parts or **remove** parts that are fundamentally unsendable (no provider could accept them); nothing meaningful is silently dropped. Concretely, before each request Pydantic AI:

- **Adds** a synthesized [`ToolReturnPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturnPart] for a tool call that has no result, telling the model the call was interrupted before a result was produced. It has [`outcome='interrupted'`][pydantic_ai.messages.BaseToolReturnPart.outcome] — a neutral outcome that (unlike `'failed'`) is not surfaced as a provider error — and carries `{'pydantic_ai_synthesized_tool_return': True}` in its [`metadata`][pydantic_ai.messages.BaseToolReturnPart.metadata] so your code can tell it apart from real tool results. This also covers a call whose arguments were cut off mid-stream: the call is kept as-is and closed out the same way. Its arguments stay verbatim in the history, but the request serializers send them as `{"INVALID_JSON": "<raw args>"}` (see [`args_as_json_str`][pydantic_ai.messages.BaseToolCallPart.args_as_json_str]) so that a provider requiring an object still accepts the request.
- **Removes** an orphaned tool result — a [`ToolReturnPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolReturnPart] or [`RetryPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.RetryPromptPart] whose tool call is absent from the history (including a result placed before its call). If this empties an interior [`ModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest] the request is removed; if it empties the last message, an empty request is kept so the history still ends on a `ModelRequest`.

After the invalid parts are handled, consecutive compatible messages are **merged** into one (two adjacent [`ModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest]s become a single turn, with tool results ordered ahead of user parts). This changes message boundaries but preserves all content, so processed history you inspect afterwards may have fewer messages than you passed in.

The repair is deterministic and idempotent: repairing the same history always produces the same output, running a repaired history through another run leaves it untouched, and synthesized parts contain no wall-clock data, so reuse doesn't invalidate provider prompt caches.

Tool calls that can still receive a real result are left alone: when the history ends on a `ModelResponse` with tool calls, running without a new `user_prompt` executes them, and [deferred tool calls](deferred-tools.md) are matched to their `deferred_tool_results` — including when a 'complete' `ModelRequest` with the already-executed results follows the response. Repair of that live frontier only happens when the interruption is evident: a final response with [`state='interrupted'`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse.state] or a trailing request with [`state='interrupted'`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest.state] (e.g. from a [cancelled stream](output.md#cancelling-streams) or a crash during tool execution) whose tool calls will never be executed.

This pipeline handles regular, locally-executed tool calls only. Provider-native tool parts — produced and resolved by the provider inline — are left untouched and repaired by each model's own serializer instead. Some other provider-invalid histories are also out of scope and may be rejected: duplicate tool results for one call, and provider-specific ordering rules beyond call/result pairing — where one of those rules is known and verified, the model's own serializer normalizes the request for it instead.

### Correlating runs with `run_id` and `conversation_id`

Each `ModelRequest` and `ModelResponse` carries two identifiers:

- [`run_id`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest.run_id] — unique per agent run. Also available as [`RunContext.run_id`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.run_id] and [`AgentRunResult.run_id`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.run_id], and emitted on the OpenTelemetry agent run span as `gen_ai.agent.call.id`.
- [`conversation_id`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest.conversation_id] — shared across all runs that build on the same `message_history`. Also available as [`AgentRunResult.conversation_id`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.conversation_id], and emitted as `gen_ai.conversation.id`.

A fresh `run_id` is generated for every agent run (or you can pass `run_id='<your-id>'` to use an ID minted by your application — e.g. one created, stored, or handed out to a client before the run starts). Unlike `conversation_id`, `run_id` is **never** inherited from `message_history`. Each [`Agent.run`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run] call — including a [deferred-tool resume](deferred-tools.md) — is a separate run with its own `run_id`. Passing an empty `run_id=''`, or a `run_id` that already appears on `message_history`, raises [`UserError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError], because both break [`new_messages()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.new_messages] boundary detection. Correlate pause/resume or multi-turn work with `conversation_id` instead. When retrying a failed run with the same `run_id`, rebuild `message_history` without the failed attempt's messages.

A fresh `conversation_id` is generated on the first run, stamped onto every message produced by that run, and inherited by subsequent runs that pass the messages back via `message_history`. This means you can correlate traces from a multi-turn conversation in [Logfire](logfire.md) (or any OpenTelemetry backend) without tracking anything yourself — as long as the message history round-trips, the conversation ID does too.

```python {title="conversation_id is shared across runs in the same conversation"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
result2 = agent.run_sync('Explain?', message_history=result1.all_messages())

assert result1.conversation_id == result2.conversation_id
assert result1.run_id != result2.run_id
```

```python {title="pass a pre-minted run_id"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel

agent = Agent(TestModel())

result = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.', run_id='run-from-api-42')
assert result.run_id == 'run-from-api-42'
```

To override or fork `conversation_id`:

- Pass `conversation_id='<your-id>'` to use an ID from your own application (e.g. a chat thread ID stored in your database).
- Pass `conversation_id='new'` to start a fresh conversation that ignores any `conversation_id` already on `message_history` — useful for branching off an existing thread without making the caller generate an ID.

!!! note "`'new'` is not a `run_id` sentinel"
    `'new'` is a sentinel for `conversation_id` only. Passing `run_id='new'` uses the literal string `"new"` as that run's id.

```python {title="forking a conversation"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
forked = agent.run_sync(
    'Tell me a different joke.',
    message_history=result1.all_messages(),
    conversation_id='new',
)

assert forked.conversation_id != result1.conversation_id
```

The [UI adapters](ui/overview.md) auto-populate `conversation_id` from the protocol's own thread/chat ID, so frontends using these protocols get conversation correlation for free. Protocol-level run IDs (for example AG-UI's `runId`) are **not** mapped into the agent's `run_id` — pass `run_id=` explicitly on [`AGUIAdapter.run_stream`][pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui.AGUIAdapter.run_stream] / [`dispatch_request`][pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui.AGUIAdapter.dispatch_request] (or a plain `Agent.run`) if you need them to match.

## Storing and loading messages (to JSON)

While maintaining conversation state in memory is enough for many applications, often times you may want to store the messages history of an agent run on disk or in a database. This might be for evals, for sharing data between Python and JavaScript/TypeScript, or any number of other use cases.

The intended way to do this is using a `TypeAdapter`.

We export [`ModelMessagesTypeAdapter`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelMessagesTypeAdapter] that can be used for this, or you can create your own.

Here's an example showing how:

```python {title="serialize messages to json"}
from pydantic_core import to_jsonable_python

from pydantic_ai import (
    Agent,
    ModelMessagesTypeAdapter,  # (1)!
)

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', instructions='Be a helpful assistant.')

result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
history_step_1 = result1.all_messages()
as_python_objects = to_jsonable_python(history_step_1)  # (2)!
same_history_as_step_1 = ModelMessagesTypeAdapter.validate_python(as_python_objects)

result2 = agent.run_sync(  # (3)!
    'Tell me a different joke.', message_history=same_history_as_step_1
)
```

1. Alternatively, you can create a `TypeAdapter` from scratch:
   ```python {lint="skip" format="skip"}
   from pydantic import TypeAdapter
   from pydantic_ai import ModelMessage
   ModelMessagesTypeAdapter = TypeAdapter(list[ModelMessage])
   ```
2. Alternatively you can serialize to/from JSON directly:
   ```python {test="skip" lint="skip" format="skip"}
   from pydantic_core import to_json
   ...
   as_json_objects = to_json(history_step_1)
   same_history_as_step_1 = ModelMessagesTypeAdapter.validate_json(as_json_objects)
   ```
3. You can now continue the conversation with history `same_history_as_step_1` despite creating a new agent run.

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

!!! note "What survives a round-trip"
    `ModelMessagesTypeAdapter` preserves every field, including application-only annotations such
    as [`TextContent.metadata`][pydantic_ai.messages.TextContent.metadata] that are *not sent to
    the model*. Because `metadata` is typed `Any`, a JSON round-trip normalizes values with no
    JSON-native form — a `tuple` reloads as a `list`, a `datetime` as its ISO string — while a
    `dump_python` → `validate_python` round-trip preserves them exactly. This is the boundary you
    use to persist and reload history.

    The [UI adapters](ui/overview.md) are different: they convert messages to a foreign wire
    protocol (Vercel AI, AG-UI) whose message shape has no place for application-only fields, so
    those fields are dropped entirely. That loss is by design, not a state-loss bug.

### Loading untrusted history

The `message_history` parameter is trusted server-side state. If you load history that came from a browser request or another untrusted boundary, sanitize it before passing it to the agent.

[`sanitize_messages`][pydantic_ai.messages.sanitize_messages] applies the same default message sanitization used by the [UI adapters](ui/overview.md): it strips client-supplied system prompts, drops non-HTTP file URL schemes, resets non-allowlisted [`FileUrl.force_download`][pydantic_ai.messages.FileUrl.force_download] values to `False`, drops uploaded file references, and removes unresolved tool calls at the end of the history.

Client-supplied [`CompactionPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.CompactionPart]s are kept, so the conversation stays [compacted](capabilities/compaction.md) — but they are never trusted to stand in for the system prompt. Whether that prompt is a [`SystemPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.SystemPromptPart] already in the history or one re-injected by [`ReinjectSystemPrompt`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ReinjectSystemPrompt], it is re-sent to the model even where a provider's own compaction state would normally let it be skipped. If you combine the sanitized history with trusted server-side `message_history`, also pass `strip_compaction_parts=True`: everything before a compaction item is hidden from the model, so a client-supplied one would hide the server's history — see [Client-held history](capabilities/compaction.md#client-held-history). The [UI adapters](ui/overview.md) apply this rule automatically when a run combines server-side `message_history` with client-submitted messages.

```python {title="sanitize untrusted message history" test="skip" lint="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelMessagesTypeAdapter
from pydantic_ai.messages import sanitize_messages

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', instructions='Be a helpful assistant.')

# `request_json` is the body submitted by an untrusted client.
loaded_history = ModelMessagesTypeAdapter.validate_python(request_json['message_history'])
message_history = sanitize_messages(loaded_history)

result = agent.run_sync('Tell me a different joke.', message_history=message_history)
```

Each sanitization can be turned off individually when the corresponding parts were created by trusted server-side code: pass `strip_system_prompts=False`, add schemes to `allowed_file_url_schemes`, add values to `allowed_file_url_force_download`, or set `allow_uploaded_files=True`.

## Trust boundary for client-supplied history

Pydantic AI's server-side surfaces are stateless: a run is reconstructed from the `message_history` (and any `deferred_tool_results`) supplied with the request, whether that request arrives through a [UI adapter](ui/overview.md) or through an endpoint you wrote yourself. A client that can submit history can therefore fabricate it — including [`ToolCallPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolCallPart]s the model never emitted and [approvals](deferred-tools.md#human-in-the-loop-tool-approval) no human granted — and the server will process them as genuine, up to and including executing the tools they name.

Pydantic AI does not sign or cryptographically verify tool calls, tool results, or approvals, and neither do comparable agent frameworks: signing is only meaningful for a server that kept the run itself, and such a server doesn't need the client's copy of the history in the first place. The defaults described under [Loading untrusted history](#loading-untrusted-history) and in the [UI adapter trust model](ui/overview.md#trust-model-for-client-submitted-messages) narrow what a fabricated history can reach; they don't make it trustworthy.

Possession of the endpoint is therefore the authorization boundary, so design around that:

- **Authenticate and authorize at the transport layer.** Run the agent inside your own authenticated route handler, and treat every caller that gets through as able to submit any history it likes.
- **Scope the toolset to the caller.** Expose only the tools the authenticated caller is entitled to use, by [building the toolset per run](toolsets.md#dynamically-building-a-toolset) or [filtering](toolsets.md#filtering-tools) it against the user carried in your [dependencies](dependencies.md).
- **Re-validate high-stakes effects server-side.** [Approval](deferred-tools.md#human-in-the-loop-tool-approval) guards against the *model* acting without human sign-off, not against the client. Where the stakes demand it, check the caller's authority against server-side state inside the tool function itself, or persist paused runs server-side and resume them with your own `deferred_tool_results` instead of the client's.

!!! note "This is a documented design boundary, not a vulnerability"
    A report that a client can forge an approval, submit a tool call the model never made, or otherwise rewrite the conversation describes this boundary behaving as designed, and is not a vulnerability in Pydantic AI. What *would* be one is a bypass of a check Pydantic AI actually performs — for instance a sanitization default that fails to strip what it documents as stripped.

## Other ways of using messages

Since messages are defined by simple dataclasses, you can manually create and manipulate, e.g. for testing.

The message format is independent of the model used, so you can use messages in different agents, or the same agent with different models.

In the example below, we reuse the message from the first agent run, which uses the `openai:gpt-5.2` model, in a second agent run using the `google:gemini-3-pro-preview` model.

```python {title="Reusing messages with a different model" hl_lines="17"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', instructions='Be a helpful assistant.')

result1 = agent.run_sync('Tell me a joke.')
print(result1.output)
#> Did you hear about the toothpaste scandal? They called it Colgate.

result2 = agent.run_sync(
    'Explain?',
    model='google:gemini-3-pro-preview',
    message_history=result1.new_messages(),
)
print(result2.output)
#> This is an excellent joke invented by Samuel Colvin, it needs no explanation.

print(result2.all_messages())
"""

    ModelRequest(
        parts=[
            UserPromptPart(
                content='Tell me a joke.',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            )
        ],
        timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
        instructions='Be a helpful assistant.',

    ModelResponse(

        conversation_id='...',
    ),
]

## Sharing messages between agents

The same `message_history` parameter also works when the next run uses a
different [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent]. This is useful for
[programmatic agent hand-off](multi-agent-applications.md#programmatic-agent-hand-off),
where your application runs one agent, then gives another agent the conversation
so far as context.

```python {title="sharing_messages_between_agents.py" hl_lines="19"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent

biography_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    instructions='Answer biographical questions concisely.',
)

science_agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    instructions='Answer science questions for a general audience.',
)

biography_result = biography_agent.run_sync('Who was Albert Einstein?')
print(biography_result.output)
#> Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.

science_result = science_agent.run_sync(
    'What was his most famous equation?',
    message_history=biography_result.new_messages(),
)
print(science_result.output)
#> Albert Einstein's most famous equation is (E = mc^2).
```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is")_

!!! tip "Handing off from a realtime session"
    A [realtime speech-to-speech session](realtime/overview.md) accumulates the same message history, so you
    can pass [`session.all_messages()`][pydantic_ai.realtime.RealtimeSession.all_messages] straight
    into `agent.run(message_history=...)` to summarize or extract structured data from a voice
    conversation. See [Realtime history and handoff](realtime/history.md).

!!! note "Instructions, system prompts, and tools"
    When you pass `message_history` to another agent, previous
    [`ModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest] messages still contain
    the instructions used by the originating agent, but those instructions are
    not sent to the model again. The receiving agent uses its own
    `instructions`; see [Instructions](agent.md#instructions) for how this
    differs from [system prompts](agent.md#system-prompts) when
    `message_history` is provided.

    `system_prompt` is different: system prompt parts are part of the message
    history. If the receiving agent has its own `system_prompt` and you need to
    ensure it is present when reusing history, see
    [`ReinjectSystemPrompt`](capabilities/reinject-system-prompt.md). Use
    `replace_existing=True` when a system prompt from another agent should not
    remain authoritative.

    Tool call and tool return parts also remain in the history. Prefer sharing
    history between agents that can understand the same tool context, or pass
    only the messages that make sense for the receiving agent.

For more complex multi-agent patterns, see the [multi-agent applications](multi-agent-applications.md) documentation.

## Editing existing messages

To change the conversation mid-run, build *new* message objects rather than modifying existing ones: [inject new messages](#injecting-messages-mid-run) with `enqueue`, or prune, summarize, or otherwise rewrite the history the model receives with a [history processor](#processing-message-history). When you need to edit an earlier message — say, compacting a large tool output — copy it with [`dataclasses.replace`][dataclasses.replace], passing a new `parts` list of new (or reused) part objects; edited parts are likewise built with `replace` rather than modified. Replacing a message in the history and reassigning its `parts` list are both safe.

!!! warning "Don't mutate existing messages in place"
    Mutating a message that's already part of the history in place — assigning to a part's fields (e.g. `ctx.messages[0].parts[0].content = '...'` from a tool) or modifying its existing `parts` list (e.g. `append` or item assignment) — is not supported. To keep long runs fast, [instrumentation](logfire.md) serializes each message only once and reuses the result when later model request spans record their `gen_ai.input.messages` attribute: a run makes two serialization passes over its history in total — one as messages are first recorded, one at the end of the run — instead of re-serializing the full history on every request (O(N) messages serialized twice, rather than O(N²) with N requests over N messages). Replaced messages and reassigned `parts` lists are picked up and serialized fresh, but a field mutated in place is not, so later request spans may not reflect it. When this is detected at the end of a run, a [`MessageHistoryMutatedWarning`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.MessageHistoryMutatedWarning] is emitted; the run-level `pydantic_ai.all_messages` attribute always reflects the final history.

## Injecting messages mid-run

Tools, capability hooks, and external code driving an agent run can inject extra content
into the conversation mid-run with [`RunContext.enqueue`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue]
(when a `RunContext` is in scope, e.g. inside a tool or capability hook) or
[`AgentRun.enqueue`][pydantic_ai.run.AgentRun.enqueue] (from external code driving
[`agent.iter()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.iter]). Use this when something happens during a
run that the agent should know about — a tool wants to add follow-up context, an external event
needs to *steer* the agent's plan, or background work needs to reach the agent when it completes.

A `priority` controls when the enqueued content is delivered:

- `'asap'` (default): delivered at the earliest opportunity — added to the next [`ModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest], or, if the agent would otherwise terminate before another request, used to redirect the run into one more request. Use when the new context should reach the model as soon as possible; this is what other frameworks often call **steering** an in-flight agent.
- `'when_idle'`: delivered only when the agent would otherwise terminate, after any `'asap'` messages. Use when the agent shouldn't be interrupted but should pick up the new work — a follow-up task — once it's done with what it's doing.

`enqueue` is variadic — each positional argument is one item, and can be:

- a piece of [`UserContent`][pydantic_ai.messages.UserContent] — a `str` or multi-modal content like an [`ImageUrl`][pydantic_ai.messages.ImageUrl]. Adjacent user content is gathered into a single [`UserPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.UserPromptPart], so `enqueue('caption', image)` forms one user turn. To pass an existing list, spread it: `enqueue(*items)`;
- a [`ModelRequestPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequestPart], such as a [`SystemPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.SystemPromptPart];
- a complete [`ModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest] or [`ModelResponse`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse], to control request-level fields like `instructions`/`metadata` or to inject a synthetic prior turn.

Adjacent part-style items (user content and [`ModelRequestPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequestPart]s) are coalesced into one [`ModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest]; complete messages stay separate. This lets a single call inject an interleaved exchange — for example a synthetic tool call (a [`ModelResponse`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse]) followed by its result (a [`ModelRequest`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest]). The content must end in a request, so the agent has something to respond to.

Both `enqueue` methods return an `enqueue_id` (`str`) for a non-empty call, or `None` when called with no content. When the queued content is actually delivered into run history, the [event stream](agent.md#streaming-all-events) yields an [`EnqueuedMessagesEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.EnqueuedMessagesEvent] carrying that `enqueue_id` and the delivered messages (exactly as they landed in history), so a client can observe when its steering message took effect. The event carries the delivered message objects themselves — the same objects held in the run's message history. A history processor that replaces history with new message objects does not affect the event, but [in-place mutation](#editing-existing-messages) of a delivered message will be visible through it.

### From inside a tool or hook

Use [`RunContext.enqueue`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue] when you have a
`RunContext` in scope:

```python {title="enqueue_from_tool.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.messages import SystemPromptPart

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-4-7')


@agent.tool
def trigger_alert(ctx: RunContext[None]) -> str:
    ctx.enqueue('Alert: production is degraded, prioritize triage.')
    return 'alert raised'


@agent.tool
def enter_incident_mode(ctx: RunContext[None]) -> str:
    # Enqueue a `SystemPromptPart` to adjust the agent's standing instructions mid-run.
    ctx.enqueue(SystemPromptPart(content='You are now in incident mode: be terse and action-oriented.'))
    return 'incident mode enabled'
```

The `'asap'` message is appended to the agent's message history and is visible to the
model on the next request, alongside any tool returns from the same step. A
[`SystemPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.SystemPromptPart] is delivered the same way, and lands as
a [mid-conversation system prompt](#mid-conversation-system-prompts) — it keeps its position in the
history instead of being lifted into the top-level system prompt, so it doesn't invalidate the
cached prefix ahead of it. Only enqueue a `SystemPromptPart` for an instruction you authored; see
the warning in that section for why late-arriving tool or webhook output belongs in user content
instead.

### From external code driving `agent.iter()`

Use [`AgentRun.enqueue`][pydantic_ai.run.AgentRun.enqueue] when you're driving a run
from outside (e.g. forwarding events from a webhook, chat platform, or job queue):

```python {title="enqueue_from_agent_run.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_graph import End

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-opus-4-7')


async def main():
    async with agent.iter('Summarize the latest deploy report') as agent_run:
        # An external system pushes a follow-up while the agent is working.
        # When the agent would otherwise finish, the message redirects it
        # into a fresh model request so it can incorporate the new context.
        agent_run.enqueue(
            'A new error was just reported — include it in the summary.',
            priority='when_idle',
        )
        node = agent_run.next_node
        while not isinstance(node, End):
            node = await agent_run.next(node)
```

`'when_idle'` messages are only drained when the agent would otherwise reach an `End` — that
drain happens in `after_node_run`. `'asap'` messages are drained in `before_model_request`, and
also at the same end-of-run point if anything arrived during the final step. Both fire however
you drive the run, so [`Agent.run`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run],
[`AgentRun.next()`][pydantic_ai.run.AgentRun.next], and a bare `async for node in agent_run:`
loop all deliver enqueued messages.

!!! info "Limitations"
    - Inside a [Temporal](durable_execution/temporal.md) workflow, tools run in
      activities and don't share state with the workflow, so `ctx.enqueue` from a
      tool doesn't currently propagate back to the run. Enqueue from the workflow
      context (e.g. via `AgentRun.enqueue`) instead.
    - Each end-of-run redirect opens a new model request. If something keeps
      enqueueing on every step (e.g. a tool that always enqueues, or a
      system-prompt callback that re-enqueues on each reinjection), the run will
      loop indefinitely. Set [`UsageLimits`][pydantic_ai.usage.UsageLimits] on the
      run as a safety net.
    - `enqueue` is designed to be called from the same event loop that drives the
      agent run. Inside the run that's automatic: async tools, sync tools (which
      Pydantic AI auto-wraps in a thread executor), and capability hooks all
      enqueue safely because the drain only iterates between graph nodes, never
      concurrently with a tool body. If you're forwarding events from a *different*
      thread or loop (e.g. a webhook handler), marshal the call onto the agent's
      loop first — e.g. `loop.call_soon_threadsafe(agent_run.enqueue, msg)`. The
      drain isn't atomic against concurrent cross-thread appends.

## Processing Message History

Sometimes you may want to modify the message history before it's sent to the model. This could be for privacy
reasons (filtering out sensitive information), to save costs on tokens, to give less context to the LLM, or
custom processing logic.

Pydantic AI provides the [`ProcessHistory`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ProcessHistory] capability that allows
you to intercept and modify the message history before each model request.

!!! note "`ProcessHistory` is a thin wrapper over `before_model_request`"
    [`ProcessHistory`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ProcessHistory] is a migration-friendly wrapper
    around the [`before_model_request`](hooks.md) lifecycle hook. If you want richer control
    over the message history — access to the full [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext]
    and [`ModelRequestContext`][pydantic_ai.models.ModelRequestContext], the ability to short-circuit
    the model call, etc. — hook the event directly via
    `capabilities=[Hooks(before_model_request=fn)]`.

!!! warning "History processors replace the message history"
    History processors replace the message history in the state with the processed messages, including the new user prompt part.
    This means that if you want to keep the original message history, you need to make a copy of it.

    When using deferred tools, preserve their
    [`ToolAvailabilityDeltaPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.ToolAvailabilityDeltaPart] entries, or the
    complete `load_capability` call and return pairs from which Pydantic AI can reconstruct them.
    Reveal state is derived from the processed history sent to the model. If a processor or
    summarizer drops both representations, the affected tools become hidden again.

!!! warning "History processors can affect `new_messages()` results"
    [`new_messages()`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult.new_messages] returns the messages
    produced during the current run. Messages provided via `message_history` are excluded —
    including the trailing `ModelRequest` when resuming without a user prompt, even though
    the framework may stamp it with the current run's `run_id` for observability.

    To keep this working when your processor mutates or adds messages:

    - If you rebuild the trailing `ModelRequest`, preserve its `parts`, `timestamp`,
      `instructions`, and `metadata` so it can still be identified as prior context.
    - If you insert a new message that should appear in `new_messages()`, use a
      [context-aware processor](#runcontext-parameter) and set `run_id=ctx.run_id` on it.

### Usage

Each [`ProcessHistory`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ProcessHistory] wraps a callable that takes a list of
[`ModelMessage`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelMessage] and returns a modified list of the same type.

Each processor is applied in sequence, and processors can be either synchronous or asynchronous.

```python {title="simple_history_processor.py"}
from pydantic_ai import (
    Agent,
    ModelMessage,
    ModelRequest,
    ModelResponse,
    TextPart,
    UserPromptPart,
)
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import ProcessHistory


def filter_responses(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    """Remove all ModelResponse messages, keeping only ModelRequest messages."""
    return [msg for msg in messages if isinstance(msg, ModelRequest)]

# Create agent with history processor
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', capabilities=[ProcessHistory(filter_responses)])

# Example: Create some conversation history
message_history = [
    ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='What is 2+2?')]),
    ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='2+2 equals 4')]),  # This will be filtered out
]

# When you run the agent, the history processor will filter out ModelResponse messages
# result = agent.run_sync('What about 3+3?', message_history=message_history)
```

#### Keep Only Recent Messages

You can use the `history_processor` to only keep the recent messages:

```python {title="keep_recent_messages.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelMessage
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import ProcessHistory


async def keep_recent_messages(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    """Keep only the last 5 messages to manage token usage."""
    return messages[-5:] if len(messages) > 5 else messages

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', capabilities=[ProcessHistory(keep_recent_messages)])

# Example: Even with a long conversation history, only the last 5 messages are sent to the model
long_conversation_history: list[ModelMessage] = []  # Your long conversation history here
# result = agent.run_sync('What did we discuss?', message_history=long_conversation_history)
```

!!! warning "Be careful when slicing the message history"
    When slicing the message history, you need to make sure that tool calls and returns are paired, otherwise the LLM may return an error. For more details, refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/2050#issuecomment-3019976269).

#### `RunContext` parameter

History processors can optionally accept a [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext] parameter to access
additional information about the current run, such as dependencies, model information, and usage statistics:

```python {title="context_aware_processor.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelMessage, RunContext
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import ProcessHistory


def context_aware_processor(
    ctx: RunContext,
    messages: list[ModelMessage],
) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    # Access current usage
    current_tokens = ctx.usage.total_tokens

    # Filter messages based on context
    if current_tokens > 1000:
        return messages[-3:]  # Keep only recent messages when token usage is high
    return messages

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', capabilities=[ProcessHistory(context_aware_processor)])
```

This allows for more sophisticated message processing based on the current state of the agent run.

Whether the processor wants a [`RunContext`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext] is detected by resolving its type hints at runtime, so every annotated type in the processor signature must be imported at runtime rather than only under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`. If any annotation can't be resolved, a [`UserError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError] is raised instead of the processor being silently called without the context.

#### Summarize Old Messages

Use an LLM to summarize older messages to preserve context while reducing tokens. This is one of several ways to keep a conversation within the context window — see [Compaction](capabilities/compaction.md) for the full picture, including provider-native compaction and ready-made strategies from [Pydantic AI Harness](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/compaction/).

```python {title="summarize_old_messages.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelMessage
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import ProcessHistory

# Use a cheaper model to summarize old messages.
summarize_agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5-mini',
    instructions="""
Summarize this conversation, omitting small talk and unrelated topics.
Focus on the technical discussion and next steps.
""",
)


async def summarize_old_messages(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    # Summarize the oldest 10 messages
    if len(messages) > 10:
        oldest_messages = messages[:10]
        summary = await summarize_agent.run(message_history=oldest_messages)
        # Return the last message and the summary
        return summary.new_messages() + messages[-1:]

    return messages


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', capabilities=[ProcessHistory(summarize_old_messages)])
```

!!! warning "Be careful when summarizing the message history"
    When summarizing the message history, you need to make sure that tool calls and returns are paired, otherwise the LLM may return an error. For more details, refer to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/2050#issuecomment-3019976269), where you can find examples of summarizing the message history.

### Testing History Processors

You can test what messages are actually sent to the model provider using
[`FunctionModel`][pydantic_ai.models.function.FunctionModel]:

```python {title="test_history_processor.py"}
import pytest

from pydantic_ai import (
    Agent,
    ModelMessage,
    ModelRequest,
    ModelResponse,
    TextPart,
    UserPromptPart,
)
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import ProcessHistory
from pydantic_ai.models.function import AgentInfo, FunctionModel


@pytest.fixture
def received_messages() -> list[ModelMessage]:
    return []


@pytest.fixture
def function_model(received_messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> FunctionModel:
    def capture_model_function(messages: list[ModelMessage], info: AgentInfo) -> ModelResponse:
        # Capture the messages that the provider actually receives
        received_messages.clear()
        received_messages.extend(messages)
        return ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='Provider response')])

    return FunctionModel(capture_model_function)


def test_history_processor(function_model: FunctionModel, received_messages: list[ModelMessage]):
    def filter_responses(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
        return [msg for msg in messages if isinstance(msg, ModelRequest)]

    agent = Agent(function_model, capabilities=[ProcessHistory(filter_responses)])

    message_history = [
        ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Question 1')]),
        ModelResponse(parts=[TextPart(content='Answer 1')]),
    ]

    agent.run_sync('Question 2', message_history=message_history)
    assert received_messages == [
        ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Question 1')]),
        ModelRequest(parts=[UserPromptPart(content='Question 2')]),
    ]
```

### Multiple Processors

You can also use multiple processors:

```python {title="multiple_history_processors.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelMessage, ModelRequest
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import ProcessHistory


def filter_responses(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    return [msg for msg in messages if isinstance(msg, ModelRequest)]


def summarize_old_messages(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> list[ModelMessage]:
    return messages[-5:]


agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    capabilities=[ProcessHistory(filter_responses), ProcessHistory(summarize_old_messages)],
)
```

In this case, the `filter_responses` processor will be applied first, and the
`summarize_old_messages` processor will be applied second.
