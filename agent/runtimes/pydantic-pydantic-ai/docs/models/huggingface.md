# Hugging Face

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is an AI platform with all major open source models, datasets, MCPs, and demos. You can use [Inference Providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers) to run open source models like DeepSeek R1 on scalable serverless infrastructure.

!!! tip "Local embeddings via Sentence Transformers"
    This page covers chat completions via Hugging Face Inference Providers. To run Hugging Face **embedding** models locally (no API key, no network calls), see the [Sentence Transformers embedding model](../embeddings.md#sentence-transformers-local), which works with any model in the [sentence-transformers library](https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html).

## Install

To use `HuggingFaceModel`, you need to either install `pydantic-ai`, or install `pydantic-ai-slim` with the `huggingface` optional group:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-slim[huggingface]"
```

## Configuration

To use [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) inference, you'll need to set up an account which will give you [free tier](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/pricing) allowance on [Inference Providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers). To setup inference, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and sign up for an account.
2. Create a new access token in [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
3. Set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable to the token you just created.

Once you have a Hugging Face access token, you can set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN='hf_token'
```

## Usage

You can then use [`HuggingFaceModel`][pydantic_ai.models.huggingface.HuggingFaceModel] by name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('huggingface:Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B')
...
```

Or initialise the model directly with just the model name:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel

model = HuggingFaceModel('Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B')
agent = Agent(model)
...
```

By default, the [`HuggingFaceModel`][pydantic_ai.models.huggingface.HuggingFaceModel] uses the
[`HuggingFaceProvider`][pydantic_ai.providers.huggingface.HuggingFaceProvider] that will select automatically
the first of the inference providers (Cerebras, Together AI, Cohere..etc) available for the model, sorted by your
preferred order in https://hf.co/settings/inference-providers.

## Configure the provider

If you want to pass parameters in code to the provider, you can programmatically instantiate the
[`HuggingFaceProvider`][pydantic_ai.providers.huggingface.HuggingFaceProvider] and pass it to the model:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.huggingface import HuggingFaceProvider

model = HuggingFaceModel('Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B', provider=HuggingFaceProvider(api_key='hf_token', provider_name='nebius'))
agent = Agent(model)
...
```

## Custom Hugging Face client

[`HuggingFaceProvider`][pydantic_ai.providers.huggingface.HuggingFaceProvider] also accepts a custom
[`AsyncInferenceClient`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.29.3/en/package_reference/inference_client#huggingface_hub.AsyncInferenceClient) client via the `hf_client` parameter, so you can customise
the `headers`, `bill_to` (billing to an HF organization you're a member of), `base_url` etc. as defined in the
[Hugging Face Hub python library docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/inference_client).

```python
from huggingface_hub import AsyncInferenceClient

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.huggingface import HuggingFaceModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.huggingface import HuggingFaceProvider

client = AsyncInferenceClient(
    bill_to='openai',
    api_key='hf_token',
    provider='fireworks-ai',
)

model = HuggingFaceModel(
    'Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B',
    provider=HuggingFaceProvider(hf_client=client),
)
agent = Agent(model)
...
```

## Streaming cancellation

!!! warning "Cancellation limitations"
    The `huggingface_hub.AsyncInferenceClient` exposes streaming responses only as an async iterator, with no separate handle for closing the underlying HTTP transport. Because of a [Python language rule on async generators](https://peps.python.org/pep-0525/), [`cancel()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.cancel] cannot interrupt an in-flight chunk read while another coroutine is iterating the stream. Pydantic AI marks the response with `state='interrupted'`, but upstream generation may continue until the surrounding `async with agent.run_stream(...)` block exits.

    For reliable cancellation, either pass `debounce_by=None` to [`stream_text()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_text], [`stream_output()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_output], or [`stream_response()`][pydantic_ai.result.StreamedRunResult.stream_response] and call `cancel()` from the same task that's iterating:

    ```python {title="cancel_huggingface.py" test="skip"}
    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    agent = Agent('huggingface:Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B')


    def should_stop(chunk: str) -> bool:
        return len(chunk) > 100


    async def main():
        async with agent.run_stream('Write a long essay about Python') as result:
            async for chunk in result.stream_text(debounce_by=None):
                if should_stop(chunk):
                    await result.cancel()
                    break
    ```

    Or, if you need to keep debouncing, wrap the stream with [`contextlib.aclosing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.aclosing) so the iterator is closed before `cancel()` runs:

    ```python {title="cancel_huggingface_aclosing.py" test="skip"}
    from contextlib import aclosing

    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    agent = Agent('huggingface:Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B')


    def should_stop(chunk: str) -> bool:
        return len(chunk) > 100


    async def main():
        async with agent.run_stream('Write a long essay about Python') as result:
            async with aclosing(result.stream_text()) as stream:
                async for chunk in stream:
                    if should_stop(chunk):
                        break
            await result.cancel()
    ```

    Calling `cancel()` from a different task while iteration is in progress is not currently reliable on this provider.
