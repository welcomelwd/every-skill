# Model Providers

Pydantic AI is model-agnostic and has built-in support for multiple model providers:

* [OpenAI](openai.md)
* [Anthropic](anthropic.md)
* [Gemini](google.md) (via two different APIs: Gemini API and Google Cloud, formerly known as Vertex AI)
* [xAI](xai.md)
* [Bedrock](bedrock.md)
* [Cerebras](cerebras.md)
* [Cohere](cohere.md)
* [Crusoe](crusoe.md)
* [Groq](groq.md)
* [Hugging Face](huggingface.md)
* [Mistral](mistral.md)
* [OpenRouter](openrouter.md)
* [Snowflake Cortex](snowflake.md)
* [Z.AI](zai.md)

## OpenAI-compatible Providers

In addition, many providers are compatible with the OpenAI API, and can be used with `OpenAIChatModel` in Pydantic AI:

- [Alibaba Cloud Model Studio (DashScope)](openai.md#alibaba-cloud-model-studio-dashscope)
- [Azure AI Foundry](openai.md#azure-ai-foundry)
- [DeepSeek](openai.md#deepseek)
- [Fireworks AI](openai.md#fireworks-ai)
- [GitHub Models](openai.md#github-models) (retired, deprecated)
- [Heroku](openai.md#heroku-ai)
- [LiteLLM](openai.md#litellm)
- [Nebius AI Studio](openai.md#nebius-ai-studio)
- [Ollama](openai.md#ollama)
- [OVHcloud AI Endpoints](openai.md#ovhcloud-ai-endpoints)
- [Perplexity](openai.md#perplexity)
- [SambaNova](openai.md#sambanova)
- [Together AI](openai.md#together-ai)
- [Vercel AI Gateway](openai.md#vercel-ai-gateway)

Pydantic AI also comes with [`TestModel`](../api/models/test.md) and [`FunctionModel`](../api/models/function.md)
for testing and development.

To use each model provider, you need to configure your local environment and make sure you have the right
packages installed. If you try to use the model without having done so, you'll be told what to install.

## Models and Providers

Pydantic AI uses a few key terms to describe how it interacts with different LLMs:

- **Model**: This refers to the Pydantic AI class used to make requests following a specific LLM API
  (generally by wrapping a vendor-provided SDK, like the `openai` python SDK). These classes implement a
  vendor-SDK-agnostic API, ensuring a single Pydantic AI agent is portable to different LLM vendors without
  any other code changes just by swapping out the Model it uses. Model classes are named
  roughly in the format `<VendorSdk>Model`, for example, we have `OpenAIChatModel`, `AnthropicModel`, `GoogleModel`,
  etc. When using a Model class, you specify the actual LLM model name (e.g., `gpt-5`,
  `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`) as a parameter.
- **Provider**: This refers to provider-specific classes which handle the authentication and connections
  to an LLM vendor. Passing a non-default _Provider_ as a parameter to a Model is how you can ensure
  that your agent will make requests to a specific endpoint, or make use of a specific approach to
  authentication (e.g., you can use Azure auth with the `OpenAIChatModel` by way of the `AzureProvider`).
  In particular, this is how you can make use of an AI gateway, or an LLM vendor that offers API compatibility
  with the vendor SDK used by an existing Model (such as `OpenAIChatModel`).
- **Profile**: This refers to a description of how requests to a specific model or family of models need to be
  constructed to get the best results, independent of the model and provider classes used.
  For example, different models have different restrictions on the JSON schemas that can be used for tools,
  and the same schema transformer needs to be used for Gemini models whether you're using `GoogleModel`
  with model name `gemini-3-pro-preview`, or `OpenAIChatModel` with `OpenRouterProvider` and model name `google/gemini-3-pro-preview`.

When you instantiate an [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent] with just a name formatted as `<provider>:<model>`, e.g. `openai:gpt-5.2` or `openrouter:google/gemini-3-pro-preview`,
Pydantic AI will automatically select the appropriate model class, provider, and profile.
If you want to use a different provider or profile, you can instantiate a model class directly and pass in `provider` and/or `profile` arguments.

### Inspecting a model's profile

A model's [`ModelProfile`][pydantic_ai.profiles.ModelProfile] also describes what the model can do. It is a `TypedDict`, so you read capability flags with normal dictionary access via `model.profile` — for example [`supports_tools`][pydantic_ai.profiles.ModelProfile.supports_tools], [`supports_json_schema_output`][pydantic_ai.profiles.ModelProfile.supports_json_schema_output], and [`supported_native_tools`][pydantic_ai.profiles.ModelProfile.supported_native_tools]. This is useful when you want to branch on a capability rather than discover a limitation at request time — for example checking whether a model supports tool calling, native JSON-schema output, or a specific native tool before relying on it:

```python
from pydantic_ai.models.test import TestModel
from pydantic_ai.native_tools import WebSearchTool

model = TestModel()
profile = model.profile

print(profile['supports_tools'])
#> True
print(profile['supports_json_schema_output'])
#> False
print(WebSearchTool in profile['supported_native_tools'])
#> True
```

`model.profile` is usually the fully *resolved* profile: keys from [`DEFAULT_PROFILE`][pydantic_ai.profiles.DEFAULT_PROFILE] are merged with the provider's defaults, so direct key access like `profile['supports_tools']` works. If you supply `profile=` as a callable (or otherwise have a partial profile dict), use `profile.get('supports_tools', DEFAULT_PROFILE['supports_tools'])` (after importing `DEFAULT_PROFILE`) to tolerate missing keys.
Any [`Model`][pydantic_ai.models.Model] instance exposes its resolved profile the same way, so the same check works whether the model was selected automatically from a `<provider>:<model>` name or instantiated directly. Don't confuse this with [Capabilities](../capabilities/overview.md), which are reusable bundles of tools, hooks, and settings you add to an agent — the profile describes what the underlying model itself supports.

## HTTP Client Lifecycle

When a [`Provider`][pydantic_ai.providers.Provider] creates its own HTTP client (i.e. you don't pass a custom `http_client`), it owns that client's lifecycle. Using the [`Agent`][pydantic_ai.Agent] as an async context manager ensures the HTTP client is closed cleanly on exit:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

async def main():
    async with agent:
        result = await agent.run('What is the capital of France?')
        print(result.output)
        #> The capital of France is Paris.
```

You can also use a [`Model`][pydantic_ai.models.Model] or [`Provider`][pydantic_ai.providers.Provider] directly as an async context manager for the same effect.

If you provide your own `http_client`, you are responsible for closing it yourself.

## Custom Models

!!! note
    If a model API is compatible with the OpenAI API, you do not need a custom model class and can provide your own [custom provider](openai.md#openai-compatible-models) instead.

To implement support for a model API that's not already supported, you will need to subclass the [`Model`][pydantic_ai.models.Model] abstract base class.
For streaming, you'll also need to implement the [`StreamedResponse`][pydantic_ai.models.StreamedResponse] abstract base class.

The best place to start is to review the source code for existing implementations, e.g. [`OpenAIChatModel`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/openai.py).

For details on when we'll accept contributions adding new models to Pydantic AI, see the [contributing guidelines](../contributing.md#new-model-rules).

## HTTP Request Concurrency

You can limit the number of concurrent HTTP requests to a model using the
[`ConcurrencyLimitedModel`][pydantic_ai.ConcurrencyLimitedModel] wrapper.
This is useful for respecting rate limits or managing resource usage when running many agents in parallel.

```python {title="model_concurrency.py"}
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai import Agent, ConcurrencyLimitedModel

# Wrap a model with concurrency limiting
model = ConcurrencyLimitedModel('openai:gpt-4o', limiter=5)

# Multiple agents can share this rate-limited model
agent = Agent(model)


async def main():
    # These will be rate-limited to 5 concurrent HTTP requests
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        *[agent.run(f'Question {i}') for i in range(20)]
    )
    print(len(results))
    #> 20
```

The `limiter` parameter accepts:

- An integer for simple limiting (e.g., `limiter=5`)
- A [`ConcurrencyLimit`][pydantic_ai.ConcurrencyLimit] for advanced configuration with backpressure control
- A [`ConcurrencyLimiter`][pydantic_ai.ConcurrencyLimiter] for sharing limits across multiple models

### Shared Concurrency Limits

To share a concurrency limit across multiple models (e.g., different models from the same provider),
you can create a [`ConcurrencyLimiter`][pydantic_ai.ConcurrencyLimiter] and pass it to
multiple `ConcurrencyLimitedModel` instances:

```python {title="shared_concurrency.py"}
import asyncio

from pydantic_ai import Agent, ConcurrencyLimitedModel, ConcurrencyLimiter

# Create a shared limiter with a descriptive name
shared_limiter = ConcurrencyLimiter(max_running=10, name='openai-pool')

# Both models share the same concurrency limit
model1 = ConcurrencyLimitedModel('openai:gpt-4o', limiter=shared_limiter)
model2 = ConcurrencyLimitedModel('openai:gpt-4o-mini', limiter=shared_limiter)

agent1 = Agent(model1)
agent2 = Agent(model2)


async def main():
    # Total concurrent requests across both agents limited to 10
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        *[agent1.run(f'Question {i}') for i in range(10)],
        *[agent2.run(f'Question {i}') for i in range(10)],
    )
    print(len(results))
    #> 20
```

When instrumentation is enabled, requests waiting for a concurrency slot appear as spans with
attributes showing the queue depth and configured limits. The `name` parameter on
`ConcurrencyLimiter` helps identify shared limiters in traces.

<!-- TODO(Marcelo): We need to create a section in the docs about reliability. -->

## Handling HTTP Errors

When a provider returns a 4xx or 5xx response, Pydantic AI raises a
[`ModelHTTPError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelHTTPError]. The exception exposes the
[`status_code`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelHTTPError.status_code], the response
[`body`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelHTTPError.body], and the provider's
**response headers** via the [`headers`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelHTTPError.headers]
attribute (a `dict[str, str]` with lowercase keys, or `None` for providers that don't
surface headers, such as gRPC-based providers).

When [OpenAI](openai.md), [Anthropic](anthropic.md), the [Google Gemini API](google.md),
[Amazon Bedrock](bedrock.md), or [Groq](groq.md) reports that a requested model identifier is
unavailable, Pydantic AI adds a close known match to the error message when one exists. The
suggestion is also available as
[`suggested_model_id`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelHTTPError.suggested_model_id]. This is
best-effort guidance after the provider rejects a request, not local validation: unknown model
identifiers remain valid so custom deployments and newly released models continue to work.

The motivating use case is propagating the `Retry-After` header from a 429 response to a
caller's own HTTP client.  A convenience property
[`retry_after`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelHTTPError.retry_after] parses that header and
returns the number of seconds to wait as a `float`, handling both the integer
delta-seconds and HTTP-date formats:

```python {title="handle_rate_limit.py" test="skip" lint="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.exceptions import ModelHTTPError

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

try:
    result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
except ModelHTTPError as exc:
    if exc.status_code == 429:
        wait = exc.retry_after  # float | None
        raise MyRateLimitException(
            'AI service is rate-limited. Try again shortly.',
            retry_after=wait,
        )
    raise
```

!!! note
    `headers` is `None` for errors synthesised from a non-HTTP source (e.g. xAI's
    gRPC transport, or OpenRouter errors parsed from a 200-OK response body).

## Fallback Model

You can use [`FallbackModel`][pydantic_ai.models.fallback.FallbackModel] to attempt multiple models
in sequence until one succeeds. Pydantic AI can switch to the next model when the current model
raises an exception (like a 4xx/5xx API error) **or** when the response content indicates a semantic
failure (like a truncated response or a failed native tool call).

By default, fallback triggers on [`ModelAPIError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelAPIError] (4xx/5xx API errors),
so you don't need to configure anything for the most common use case.

This behavior is controlled by the `fallback_on` parameter (see
[`FallbackModel`][pydantic_ai.models.fallback.FallbackModel]), which accepts exception types,
exception handlers, and response handlers — all of which can be sync or async.

!!! note
    The provider SDKs on which Models are based (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) often have built-in retry logic that can delay the `FallbackModel` from activating.

    When using `FallbackModel`, it's recommended to disable provider SDK retries to ensure immediate fallback, for example by setting `max_retries=0` on a [custom OpenAI client](openai.md#custom-openai-client).

In the following example, the agent first makes a request to the OpenAI model (which fails due to an invalid API key),
and then falls back to the Anthropic model.

```python {title="fallback_model.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIChatModel

openai_model = OpenAIChatModel('gpt-5.2')
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel('claude-sonnet-4-5')
fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)

agent = Agent(fallback_model)
response = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(response.output)
#> The capital of France is Paris.

print(response.all_messages())
"""
[
    ModelRequest(
        parts=[
            UserPromptPart(
                content='What is the capital of France?',
                timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
            )
        ],
        timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
        run_id='...',
        conversation_id='...',
    ),
    ModelResponse(
        parts=[TextPart(content='The capital of France is Paris.')],
        usage=RequestUsage(cost=Decimal('0.000273'), input_tokens=56, output_tokens=7),
        model_name='claude-sonnet-4-5',
        timestamp=datetime.datetime(...),
        run_id='...',
        conversation_id='...',
    ),
]
"""
```

The `ModelResponse` message above indicates in the `model_name` field that the output was returned by the Anthropic model, which is the second model specified in the `FallbackModel`.

!!! note
    Each model's options should be configured individually. For example, `base_url`, `api_key`, and custom clients should be set on each model itself, not on the `FallbackModel`.

### Per-Model Settings

You can configure different [`ModelSettings`][pydantic_ai.settings.ModelSettings] for each model in a fallback chain by passing the `settings` parameter when creating each model. This is particularly useful when different providers have different optimal configurations:

```python {title="fallback_model_per_settings.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelSettings
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIChatModel

# Configure each model with provider-specific optimal settings
openai_model = OpenAIChatModel(
    'gpt-5.2',
    settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=1000)  # Higher creativity for OpenAI
)
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel(
    'claude-sonnet-4-5',
    settings=ModelSettings(temperature=0.2, max_tokens=1000)  # Lower temperature for consistency
)

fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)
agent = Agent(fallback_model)

result = agent.run_sync('Write a creative story about space exploration')
print(result.output)
"""
In the year 2157, Captain Maya Chen piloted her spacecraft through the vast expanse of the Andromeda Galaxy. As she discovered a planet with crystalline mountains that sang in harmony with the cosmic winds, she realized that space exploration was not just about finding new worlds, but about finding new ways to understand the universe and our place within it.
"""
```

In this example, if the OpenAI model fails, the agent will automatically fall back to the Anthropic model with its own configured settings. The `FallbackModel` itself doesn't have settings - it uses the individual settings of whichever model successfully handles the request.

### Exception Handling

The next example demonstrates the exception-handling capabilities of `FallbackModel`.
If all models fail, a [`FallbackExceptionGroup`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.FallbackExceptionGroup] is raised, which
contains all the exceptions encountered during the `run` execution.

=== "Python >=3.11"

    ```python {title="fallback_model_failure.py" py="3.11"}
    from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelAPIError
    from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
    from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
    from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIChatModel

    openai_model = OpenAIChatModel('gpt-5.2')
    anthropic_model = AnthropicModel('claude-sonnet-4-5')
    fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)

    agent = Agent(fallback_model)
    try:
        response = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
    except* ModelAPIError as exc_group:
        for exc in exc_group.exceptions:
            print(exc)
    ```

=== "Python <3.11"

    Since [`except*`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#except-star) is only supported
    in Python 3.11+, we use the [`exceptiongroup`](https://github.com/agronholm/exceptiongroup) backport
    package for earlier Python versions:

    ```python {title="fallback_model_failure.py" noqa="F821" test="skip"}
    from exceptiongroup import catch

    from pydantic_ai import Agent, ModelAPIError
    from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
    from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
    from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIChatModel


    def model_status_error_handler(exc_group: BaseExceptionGroup) -> None:
        for exc in exc_group.exceptions:
            print(exc)


    openai_model = OpenAIChatModel('gpt-5.2')
    anthropic_model = AnthropicModel('claude-sonnet-4-5')
    fallback_model = FallbackModel(openai_model, anthropic_model)

    agent = Agent(fallback_model)
    with catch({ModelAPIError: model_status_error_handler}):
        response = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
    ```

By default, the `FallbackModel` only moves on to the next model if the current model raises a
[`ModelAPIError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelAPIError], which includes
[`ModelHTTPError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelHTTPError]. You can customize this behavior by
passing a custom `fallback_on` argument to the `FallbackModel` constructor.

!!! note
    Validation errors (from [structured output](../output.md#structured-output) or [tool parameters](../tools.md)) do **not** trigger fallback. These errors use the [retry mechanism](../agent.md#reflection-and-self-correction) instead, which re-prompts the same model to try again. This is intentional: validation errors stem from the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and may succeed on retry, whereas API errors (4xx/5xx) generally indicate issues that won't resolve by retrying the same request.

### Response-Based Fallback

In addition to exception-based fallback, you can also trigger fallback based on the **content** of a model's response. This is useful when a model returns a successful HTTP response (no exception), but the response content indicates a semantic failure — for example, an unexpected finish reason or a native tool reporting failure.

!!! note "Non-streaming only"
    Response-based fallback currently only works with non-streaming requests (`agent.run()` and `agent.run_sync()`).
    For streaming requests (`agent.run_stream()`), only exception-based fallback is supported.

The `fallback_on` parameter accepts:

- A tuple of exception types: `(ModelAPIError, ModelHTTPError)`
- An exception handler (sync or async): `lambda exc: isinstance(exc, MyError)`
- A response handler (sync or async): `def check(r: ModelResponse) -> bool`
- A list mixing all of the above: `[ModelAPIError, exc_handler, response_handler]`

Handler type is auto-detected by inspecting type hints on the first parameter. If the first parameter is hinted as [`ModelResponse`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse], it's a response handler. Otherwise (including untyped handlers and lambdas), it's an exception handler.

As the hints are resolved at runtime, every annotated type in the handler signature must be imported at runtime rather than only under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`. If any annotation can't be resolved, a [`UserError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError] is raised instead of the handler being silently treated as an exception handler.

#### Finish Reason Example

A simple use case is checking the model's finish reason — for example, falling back if the response was truncated due to length limits:

```python {title="fallback_on_finish_reason.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import FinishReason, ModelResponse
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel


def bad_finish_reason(response: ModelResponse) -> bool:
    """Fallback if the model stopped due to length limit, content filter, or error."""
    reason: FinishReason | None = response.finish_reason
    # Trigger fallback for problematic finish reasons
    return reason in ('length', 'content_filter', 'error')


fallback_model = FallbackModel(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5',
    fallback_on=bad_finish_reason,
)

agent = Agent(fallback_model)
result = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
print(result.output)
#> The capital of France is Paris.
```

!!! warning "Solo response handlers replace default exception fallback"
    When you pass a single response handler as `fallback_on` (as above), it **replaces** the default `(ModelAPIError,)` exception fallback entirely. This means API errors (4xx/5xx) will propagate as exceptions instead of triggering fallback to the next model.

    To keep exception-based fallback alongside a response handler, pass them together as a list — see the [mixed example below](#combining-handlers).

!!! note
    The [agent loop](../agent.md) only acts on a finish reason when the response has no actionable
    output. A `'length'` finish reason on an empty or thinking-only response raises
    [`UnexpectedModelBehavior`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UnexpectedModelBehavior] (typically the model hit
    the token limit mid-thinking), and an empty response with a `'content_filter'` finish reason raises
    [`ContentFilterError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ContentFilterError]. Other empty or thinking-only
    responses are re-prompted, up to the output retry limit. Non-empty responses are handled normally
    regardless of finish reason — a tool call truncated mid-arguments is re-prompted like any other
    invalid-arguments failure, and only once its retry budget is exhausted does it surface as
    [`IncompleteToolCall`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.IncompleteToolCall] (a subclass of
    `UnexpectedModelBehavior`).

    All of these are raised from the agent loop, after `model.request()` has already returned
    successfully, so no exception-based `fallback_on` can catch them — not the default
    `fallback_on=(ModelAPIError,)` (which wouldn't match anyway, as `ContentFilterError` inherits from
    `UnexpectedModelBehavior`, not [`ModelAPIError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ModelAPIError]), and not an
    explicit `fallback_on=(ContentFilterError,)` either. To fall back on a bad finish reason instead,
    use a response handler (see the [example above](#finish-reason-example)) that inspects
    [`finish_reason`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse.finish_reason]: it rejects the response inside
    `FallbackModel` before the agent loop sees it, so the next model is tried instead of an exception
    being raised. Note that it rejects *every* response with that finish reason, including non-empty
    ones the agent loop would have accepted. To instead raise on `content_filter` responses that still
    carry partial or refusal text, add the
    [`RaiseContentFilterError`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.RaiseContentFilterError] capability.

#### Native Tool Failure Example

A more complex use case is when using native tools like web search or URL fetching. For example, Google's [`WebFetchTool`][pydantic_ai.native_tools.WebFetchTool] may return a successful response with a status indicating the URL fetch failed:

```python {title="fallback_on_native_tool.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.messages import ModelResponse
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel
from pydantic_ai.models.google import GoogleModel


def web_fetch_failed(response: ModelResponse) -> bool:
    """Check if a web_fetch native tool failed to retrieve content."""
    for call, result in response.native_tool_calls:
        if call.tool_name != 'web_fetch':
            continue
        if not isinstance(result.content, list):
            continue
        for item in result.content:
            if isinstance(item, dict):
                status = item.get('url_retrieval_status', '')
                if status and status != 'URL_RETRIEVAL_STATUS_SUCCESS':
                    return True
    return False


google_model = GoogleModel('gemini-2.5-flash')
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel('claude-sonnet-4-5')

# Auto-detected as response handler via type hint
fallback_model = FallbackModel(
    google_model,
    anthropic_model,
    fallback_on=web_fetch_failed,
)

agent = Agent(fallback_model)

# If Google's web_fetch fails, automatically falls back to Anthropic
result = agent.run_sync('Summarize https://ai.pydantic.dev')
print(result.output)
"""
Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework for building production-grade LLM applications.
"""
```

Response handlers receive the [`ModelResponse`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse] returned by the model and should return `True` to trigger fallback to the next model, or `False` to accept the response.

#### Combining Handlers

You can combine exception types, exception handlers, and response handlers in a single list:

```python {title="fallback_on_mixed.py" requires="fallback_on_native_tool.py"}
from pydantic_ai.exceptions import ModelAPIError
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel

from fallback_on_native_tool import anthropic_model, google_model, web_fetch_failed

fallback_model = FallbackModel(
    google_model,
    anthropic_model,

### Exception Handling in Middleware and Decorators

When using `FallbackModel`, it's important to understand that [`FallbackExceptionGroup`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.FallbackExceptionGroup]
inherits from Python's [`ExceptionGroup`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup). This means
that existing exception handling code that catches specific exceptions (like `ModelAPIError`) won't automatically catch
the individual exceptions wrapped inside the group.

For example, if you have middleware or a decorator that catches `ModelAPIError`:

```python {title="middleware_without_fallback.py"}
from collections.abc import Callable
from functools import wraps
from typing import TypeVar

from pydantic_ai import ModelAPIError

T = TypeVar('T')


# This handler will NOT catch ModelAPIError when using FallbackModel!
def handle_api_errors(func: Callable[..., T]) -> Callable[..., T]:
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> T:
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except ModelAPIError as e:  # Won't catch FallbackExceptionGroup
            print(f'API error: {e}')
            raise

    return wrapper
```

This decorator will miss `ModelAPIError` exceptions when using `FallbackModel`, because they're wrapped in a
`FallbackExceptionGroup` containing one exception per failed model, in the order the models were tried.

To handle both cases, you can use Python 3.11+ `except*` syntax, which catches matching exceptions from
exception groups as well as bare exceptions. Note that `except*` always delivers the caught exceptions as an
`ExceptionGroup` (even if the original was a bare exception), so re-raising will propagate an `ExceptionGroup`
rather than the original exception type:

=== "Python >=3.11"

    ```python {title="middleware_with_fallback.py" py="3.11"}
    from collections.abc import Callable
    from functools import wraps
    from typing import TypeVar

    from pydantic_ai import ModelAPIError

    T = TypeVar('T')


    def handle_api_errors(func: Callable[..., T]) -> Callable[..., T]:
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> T:
            try:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            except* ModelAPIError as exc_group:
                for exc in exc_group.exceptions:
                    print(f'API error: {exc}')
                raise

        return wrapper
    ```

=== "Python <3.11"

    ```python {title="middleware_with_fallback.py" noqa="F821" test="skip"}
    from collections.abc import Callable
    from functools import wraps
    from typing import TypeVar

    from pydantic_ai import FallbackExceptionGroup, ModelAPIError

    T = TypeVar('T')


    def handle_api_errors(func: Callable[..., T]) -> Callable[..., T]:
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> T:
            try:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            except FallbackExceptionGroup as exc_group:
                for exc in exc_group.exceptions:
                    if isinstance(exc, ModelAPIError):
                        print(f'API error from fallback: {exc}')
                raise
            except ModelAPIError as e:
                print(f'API error: {e}')
                raise

        return wrapper
    ```

You can also catch `FallbackExceptionGroup` directly if you want to handle it specifically:

```python {title="catch_fallback_exception_group.py" test="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, FallbackExceptionGroup
from pydantic_ai.models.fallback import FallbackModel

agent = Agent(FallbackModel('openai:gpt-5-mini', 'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6'))

try:
    response = agent.run_sync('What is the capital of France?')
except FallbackExceptionGroup as exc_group:
    print(f'All {len(exc_group.exceptions)} models failed:')
    for exc in exc_group.exceptions:
        print(f'  - {exc}')
```
