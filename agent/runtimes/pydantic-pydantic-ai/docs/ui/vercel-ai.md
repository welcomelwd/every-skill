# Vercel AI Data Stream Protocol

Pydantic AI natively supports the [Vercel AI Data Stream Protocol](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol#data-stream-protocol) to receive agent run input from, and stream events to, a frontend using [AI SDK UI](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) hooks like [`useChat`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat). You can optionally use [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements) for pre-built UI components.

!!! note
    By default, the adapter targets AI SDK v5 for backwards compatibility. To use features introduced in AI SDK v6, set `sdk_version=6` on the adapter.

## Usage

The [`VercelAIAdapter`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter] class is responsible for transforming agent run input received from the frontend into arguments for [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../agent.md#running-agents), running the agent, and then transforming Pydantic AI events into Vercel AI events. The event stream transformation is handled by the [`VercelAIEventStream`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIEventStream] class, which you typically won't use directly unless the agent's events reach you outside the request that serves the frontend, as covered in ["Encoding events without a request"](./overview.md#encoding-events-without-a-request).

If you're using a Starlette-based web framework like FastAPI, you can use the [`VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request()`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.dispatch_request] class method from an endpoint function to directly handle a request and return a streaming response of Vercel AI events. This is demonstrated in the next section.

If you're using a web framework not based on Starlette (e.g. Django or Flask) or need fine-grained control over the input or output, you can create a `VercelAIAdapter` instance and directly use its methods. This is demonstrated in "Advanced Usage" section below.

### Usage with Starlette/FastAPI

Besides the request, [`VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request()`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.dispatch_request] takes the agent, the same optional arguments as [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../agent.md#running-agents), an optional `on_complete` callback for successful runs, and an optional `on_cancel` callback for cancelled runs. Both callbacks can optionally yield additional Vercel AI events.

```py {title="dispatch_request.py"}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import Response

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai import VercelAIAdapter

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

app = FastAPI()

@app.post('/chat')
async def chat(request: Request) -> Response:
    return await VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request(request, agent=agent)
```

### Advanced Usage

If you're using a web framework not based on Starlette (e.g. Django or Flask) or need fine-grained control over the input or output, you can create a `VercelAIAdapter` instance and directly use its methods, which can be chained to accomplish the same thing as the `VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request()` class method shown above:

1. The [`VercelAIAdapter.build_run_input()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.build_run_input] class method takes the request body as bytes and returns a Vercel AI [`RequestData`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.request_types.RequestData] run input object, which you can then pass to the [`VercelAIAdapter()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter] constructor along with the agent.
    - You can also use the [`VercelAIAdapter.from_request()`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.from_request] class method to build an adapter directly from a Starlette/FastAPI request.
2. The [`VercelAIAdapter.run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.run_stream] method runs the agent and returns a stream of Vercel AI events. It supports the same optional arguments as [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../agent.md#running-agents), including the `on_complete` and `on_cancel` callbacks.
    - You can also use [`VercelAIAdapter.run_stream_native()`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.run_stream_native] to run the agent and return a stream of Pydantic AI events instead, which can then be transformed into Vercel AI events using [`VercelAIAdapter.transform_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.transform_stream].
3. The [`VercelAIAdapter.encode_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.encode_stream] method encodes the stream of Vercel AI events as SSE (HTTP Server-Sent Events) strings, which you can then return as a streaming response.
    - You can also use [`VercelAIAdapter.streaming_response()`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.streaming_response] to generate a Starlette/FastAPI streaming response directly from the Vercel AI event stream returned by `run_stream()`.

!!! note
    This example uses FastAPI, but can be modified to work with any web framework.

### Cancellation

When a run ends in [first-party cancellation](../agent.md#cancelling-a-run) — `ctx.cancel()` from a tool, `AgentRun.cancel()`, or a [`CancellationToken`][pydantic_ai.CancellationToken] your server wires to a cancel endpoint — the adapter emits a Vercel `abort` chunk. [`useChat`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat) keeps the partial message and reports `isAbort` to `onFinish` instead of entering an error state. Pass an `on_cancel` callback to persist the resumable message history, as shown in the example below.

!!! note "Client disconnects are external cancellation"
    Calling `stop()` on the client aborts the browser's request, which the server sees as a *disconnect*, not a first-party cancellation. That tears the run down as an external `asyncio.CancelledError` (see [the two kinds of cancellation](../agent.md#cancelling-a-run)), so no `abort` chunk is emitted and `on_cancel` does not fire — and the client has disconnected anyway. To get the `abort` chunk and run `on_cancel` on a stop gesture, keep the stream connected and cancel the run *first-party*: give the run a [`CancellationToken`][pydantic_ai.CancellationToken] and expose a separate endpoint (e.g. `POST /chat/{id}/cancel`) that calls `token.cancel()`.

```py {title="run_stream.py"}
import json
from http import HTTPStatus

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.requests import Request
from fastapi.responses import Response, StreamingResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunCancelled
from pydantic_ai.ui import SSE_CONTENT_TYPE
from pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai import VercelAIAdapter

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

app = FastAPI()


async def on_cancel(cancelled: RunCancelled) -> None:
    messages = cancelled.all_messages()  # (1)!
    print(f'cancelled after {len(messages)} messages')


@app.post('/chat')
async def chat(request: Request) -> Response:
    accept = request.headers.get('accept', SSE_CONTENT_TYPE)
    try:
        run_input = VercelAIAdapter.build_run_input(await request.body())
    except ValidationError as e:
        return Response(
            content=json.dumps(e.json()),
            media_type='application/json',
            status_code=HTTPStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY,
        )

    adapter = VercelAIAdapter(agent=agent, run_input=run_input, accept=accept)
    event_stream = adapter.run_stream(on_cancel=on_cancel)

    sse_event_stream = adapter.encode_stream(event_stream)
    return StreamingResponse(sse_event_stream, media_type=accept)
```

1. The resumable history to persist -- pass it as `message_history` to a later run to resume the conversation.

### Data Chunks

Pydantic AI tools can send [Vercel AI data stream chunks](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol#data-stream-protocol) by returning a
[`ToolReturn`](../tools-advanced.md#advanced-tool-returns) object with a data-carrying chunk
(or a list of chunks) as `metadata`.
The supported chunk types are [`DataChunk`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.response_types.DataChunk],
[`SourceUrlChunk`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.response_types.SourceUrlChunk],
[`SourceDocumentChunk`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.response_types.SourceDocumentChunk],
and [`FileChunk`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.response_types.FileChunk].
This is useful for attaching structured data to the frontend alongside the tool result, such as source URLs or custom data payloads.

```python {title="vercel_ai_tool_chunks.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent, ToolReturn
from pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.response_types import DataChunk, SourceUrlChunk

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')


@agent.tool_plain
async def search_docs(query: str) -> ToolReturn:
    return ToolReturn(
        return_value=f'Found 2 results for "{query}"',
        metadata=[
            SourceUrlChunk(
                source_id='doc-1',
                url='https://example.com/docs/intro',
                title='Introduction',
            ),
            DataChunk(
                type='data-search-results',
                data={'query': query, 'count': 2},
            ),
        ],
    )
```

!!! note
    Protocol-control chunks such as `StartChunk`, `FinishChunk`, `StartStepChunk`, or `FinishStepChunk` are automatically filtered out — only the four data-carrying chunk types listed above are forwarded to the stream and preserved in `dump_messages`.

### Files from client-side tools

Vercel AI SDK [client-side tools](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot-tool-usage#client-side-tools) run in the browser and submit their result back to the server, where Pydantic AI resolves them as [external tool calls](../deferred-tools.md#external-tool-execution). Such a tool can return a file by putting a shape in its output that matches one of Pydantic AI's [multimodal content types](../input.md); Pydantic AI deserializes it into that type (via the same `ToolReturnContent` discriminator used for round-tripping) before the run continues. Use the type's snake_case field names — these are validated as Pydantic AI models, not Vercel-cased payloads, so `media_type` deserializes but `mediaType` stays an opaque dict. Three shapes are supported:

- **Inline bytes** — a [`BinaryContent`][pydantic_ai.messages.BinaryContent] shape, `{ kind: 'binary', media_type: 'image/png', data: <bytes> }` (image media types become [`BinaryImage`][pydantic_ai.messages.BinaryImage]). The `data` field accepts a base64 string, or the raw byte shapes a JavaScript frontend produces when it forwards a `Uint8Array` or Node `Buffer` through `JSON.stringify` without encoding it first (`{ "0": 137, "1": 80, ... }` or `{ "type": "Buffer", "data": [137, 80, ...] }`) — all normalized to bytes at the wire boundary, so a client-side tool can return binary data without base64-encoding it by hand.
- **A file URL** — a [`FileUrl`][pydantic_ai.messages.FileUrl] shape such as `{ kind: 'image-url', url: 'https://...' }` or `{ kind: 'document-url', url: 'https://...' }`. This is often more efficient than inlining the bytes, since only the reference crosses the wire and the provider fetches the file directly — a good fit when the file already lives at a URL the frontend trusts. The URL is honored only if its scheme passes the adapter's [`allowed_file_url_schemes`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.allowed_file_url_schemes] allowlist (`http`/`https` by default); see the [trust model](#trust-model).
- **A provider-hosted file** — an [`UploadedFile`][pydantic_ai.messages.UploadedFile] shape, `{ kind: 'uploaded-file', file_id: 'file-123', provider_name: 'openai' }`, referencing a file already uploaded to the provider's storage. Honored only when [`allow_uploaded_files`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.allow_uploaded_files] is `True`, since the server resolves it against the provider's file API using its own credentials.

## Message metadata

[`VercelAIAdapter.dump_messages`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.dump_messages] writes [`ModelRequest.metadata`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelRequest.metadata] and [`ModelResponse.metadata`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelResponse.metadata] into Vercel AI [`UIMessage.metadata`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/message-metadata), and stores the message `timestamp` under a reserved `pydantic_ai` key so it survives the round-trip. [`VercelAIAdapter.load_messages`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.load_messages] restores it on the way back.

When streaming, the timestamp is also emitted as a Vercel AI `message-metadata` chunk after the final step, so frontends using AI SDK UI can persist it with the assistant message. Request-side messages have no analogous chunk — frontends rebuilding history purely from streamed chunks see timestamps only on assistant responses, whereas `dump_messages` populates both sides.

`UIMessage.metadata` is fully client-controlled, so only `timestamp` is round-tripped: server-side fields such as `usage`, `model_name`, and `provider_*` are deliberately excluded — dumping them could leak infrastructure details, and restoring them would trust client-submitted history for values the server owns. Broadening the round-trip behind an explicit user-controlled opt-in is tracked in [issue #5174](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/5174).

## Trust model

Vercel AI's request `messages` array is fully client-controlled, and the protocol round-trips approval responses and tool results through the message history. The [`VercelAIAdapter`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter] applies defaults to strip untrusted parts before the agent runs — see [Trust model for client-submitted messages](./overview.md#trust-model-for-client-submitted-messages) in the UI adapter overview, which covers system prompts, file URL schemes, uploaded files ([`allow_uploaded_files`][pydantic_ai.ui.UIAdapter.allow_uploaded_files]), and unresolved tool calls. Those defaults don't make client-submitted history authentic — see [Trust boundary for client-supplied history](../message-history.md#trust-boundary-for-client-supplied-history).

## Compaction

[`CompactionPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.CompactionPart]s round-trip through Vercel AI data parts (`data-compaction`), so [compacted](../capabilities/compaction.md) conversations keep working when a frontend such as `useChat` holds the message history. A compaction item submitted by the frontend is honored — the conversation stays compacted — with two caveats. First, it is never trusted to stand in for the system prompt: whichever prompt applies per [System prompts and instructions](#system-prompts-and-instructions) still reaches the model on every request. Second, if the run also receives server-side `message_history` (the [server-side persistence pattern](./overview.md#trust-model-for-client-submitted-messages)), frontend compaction items are ignored — everything before a compaction item is hidden from the model, so honoring one from the frontend would let it hide the server's stored history. See [Client-held history](../capabilities/compaction.md#client-held-history) for the trade-offs and the recommended server-side pattern.

## Tool Approval

!!! note
    Tool approval requires AI SDK UI v6 or later on the frontend.

Pydantic AI supports human-in-the-loop tool approval workflows with AI SDK UI, allowing users to approve or deny tool executions before they run. See the [deferred tool calls documentation](../deferred-tools.md#human-in-the-loop-tool-approval) for details on setting up tools that require approval.

To enable tool approval streaming, pass `sdk_version=6` to `dispatch_request`:

```py {test="skip" lint="skip"}
@app.post('/chat')
async def chat(request: Request) -> Response:
    return await VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request(request, agent=agent, sdk_version=6)
```

When `sdk_version=6`, the adapter will:

1. Emit `tool-approval-request` chunks when tools with `requires_approval=True` are called
2. Automatically extract approval responses from follow-up requests
3. Emit `tool-output-denied` chunks for rejected tools

On the frontend, AI SDK UI's [`useChat`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat) hook handles the approval flow. You can use the [`Confirmation`](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/components/confirmation) component from AI Elements for a pre-built approval UI, or build your own using the hook's `addToolApprovalResponse` function.

Tool approval responses are trusted from the request by design, matching the protocol's round-trip through `useChat`'s `addToolApprovalResponse` and the reference Next.js backend. The decision itself must be an actual JSON boolean: `approved` is strictly typed, so any stand-in — `1` or `"true"` as much as `0` or `"false"` — fails request validation rather than being coerced into a decision. If your application needs the approval decision tied to server-side state rather than the request, intercept [`DeferredToolRequests`][pydantic_ai.DeferredToolRequests], persist the approval IDs server-side, and pass explicit `deferred_tool_results` when resuming.

## Tool input validation

`tool-input-available` is emitted **after** the agent has validated the call against the tool's schema and any custom [`args_validator`](../tools-advanced.md#args-validator), so the chunk only fires once the args are known to be acceptable. The chunk's `input` field carries the raw arguments the model emitted.

When validation fails, the adapter emits `tool-input-error` instead of `tool-input-available`. The chunk carries the same `tool_call_id`, `tool_name`, and `input` (the raw arguments) plus an `error_text` field rendered from the message that will be sent back to the model. When the validation failure is retryable, the agent retries the call (subject to the tool's `retries` setting) and emits a new `tool-input-(available|error)` for each attempt; when a custom validator raises [`ToolFailed`](../tools-advanced.md#tool-failed), the failure is terminal and no retry follows.

## System prompts and instructions

Pydantic AI supports two ways to provide guidance to the model: [`system_prompt`](../agent.md#system-prompts) (stored in the message history as [`SystemPromptPart`][pydantic_ai.messages.SystemPromptPart]s) and [`instructions`](../agent.md#instructions) (injected fresh on every request, never persisted). When you control the server side, `instructions` is the recommended default.

The rest of this section only matters if you use `system_prompt`. If you only use `instructions`, there's nothing to configure — they're always applied regardless of the frontend message history.

For `system_prompt`, you choose who owns it with the `manage_system_prompt` parameter on [`VercelAIAdapter`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter]:

- `'server'` (default): the agent's configured `system_prompt` is authoritative. Any system message sent by the frontend is stripped with a warning (a malicious client could otherwise inject arbitrary instructions via crafted API requests), and the agent's own system prompt is reinjected at the head of the first request via the [`ReinjectSystemPrompt`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ReinjectSystemPrompt] capability.
- `'client'`: the frontend owns the system prompt. Frontend system messages are preserved as-is, and the agent's configured `system_prompt` is not injected — the caller is fully responsible for sending it on every turn if desired. To opt into fallback-to-configured behavior, add the [`ReinjectSystemPrompt`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ReinjectSystemPrompt] capability to your agent.
