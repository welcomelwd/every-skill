# Version Policy

Pydantic AI V1 was released in September 2025, and the stable V2.0 was released on June 23, 2026; see the [Upgrade Guide](changelog.md) for what's in V2, how to install it, and how to upgrade.

We will not intentionally make breaking changes in minor releases. Functionality marked as deprecated in a release is not removed until the next major version, which we won't release sooner than 3 months after V2.0.

We'll continue to provide security fixes for V1 for at least 6 months after V2's stable release, so you have time to upgrade your applications. When you're ready to make the jump, the [Upgrade Guide](changelog.md) lists the breaking changes for each version, along with our recommended path to V2.

Of course, some apparently safe changes and bug fixes will inevitably break some users' code &mdash; obligatory link to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1172/).

The following changes will **NOT** be considered breaking changes, and may occur in minor releases:

* Bug fixes that may result in existing code breaking, provided that such code was relying on undocumented features/constructs/assumptions.
* Adding new [message parts][pydantic_ai.messages], [stream events][pydantic_ai.messages.AgentStreamEvent], or optional fields (including fields with default values) on existing message (part) and event types. Always code defensively when consuming message parts or event streams, and use the [`ModelMessagesTypeAdapter`][pydantic_ai.messages.ModelMessagesTypeAdapter] to (de)serialize message histories.
* Changing OpenTelemetry span attributes. Because different [observability platforms](logfire.md#using-opentelemetry) support different versions of the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for Generative AI systems](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/), Pydantic AI lets you configure the [instrumentation version](logfire.md#configuring-data-format), but the default version may change in a minor release. Span attributes for [Pydantic Evals](evals.md) may also change as we iterate on Evals support in [Pydantic Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/web-ui/evals/).
* Changing how `__repr__` behaves, even of public classes.

In all cases we will aim to minimize churn and do so only when justified by the increase of quality of Pydantic AI for users.

## Beta Features

At Pydantic, we like to move quickly and innovate! To that end, minor releases may introduce beta features (indicated by a `beta` module) that are active works in progress. While in its beta phase, a feature's API and behaviors may not be stable, and it's very possible that changes made to the feature will not be backward-compatible. We aim to move beta features out of beta within a few months after initial release, once users have had a chance to provide feedback and test the feature in production.

## Support for Python versions

Pydantic will drop support for a Python version when the following conditions are met:

* The Python version has reached its [expected end of life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
* less than 5% of downloads of the most recent minor release are using that version.
