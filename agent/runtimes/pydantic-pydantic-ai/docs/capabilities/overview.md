# Capabilities

A capability is a reusable, composable unit of agent behavior. Instead of threading multiple arguments through your `Agent` constructor — [instructions](../agent.md#instructions) here, [model settings](../agent.md#model-run-settings) there, a [toolset](../toolsets.md) somewhere else, a [history processor](../message-history.md#processing-message-history) on yet another parameter — you can bundle related behavior into a single capability and pass it via the [`capabilities`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.__init__] parameter.

Capabilities can provide any combination of:

* **Tools** — via [toolsets](../toolsets.md) or [native tools](../native-tools.md)
* **Lifecycle hooks** — intercept and modify model requests, tool calls, and the overall run
* **Instructions** — static or dynamic [instruction](../agent.md#instructions) additions
* **Model settings** — static or per-step [model settings](../agent.md#model-run-settings)
* **Models** — static or adaptive model selection and application-specific model ID resolution

This makes them the primary extension point for Pydantic AI. Whether you're building a memory system, a guardrail, a cost tracker, or an approval workflow, a capability is the right abstraction.

Capabilities can be always-on or [loaded by the model on demand](on-demand.md). The [capability index below](#available-capabilities) spans Pydantic AI itself and [Pydantic AI Harness](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/), [third-party packages](third-party.md) provide many more, and you can define your own, [declaratively](#bundling-behavior-with-capability) or by [subclassing](custom.md). To run agents durably across failures, restarts, and long waits, see [Durable Execution](../durable_execution/overview.md).

## Available capabilities

Capabilities come from two packages, and they all compose, with each other and with your own. Core (`pydantic-ai`) ships the capabilities that require model or framework support: provider-native tools, provider APIs, and deep loop integration. **[Pydantic AI Harness](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/)**, the official capability library and harness for Pydantic AI, ships everything else, from single capabilities to [complete agents](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/coder/). The **Package** column says which; every entry links to its documentation.

### Harnesses

Complete agent stacks as regular combined capabilities: one import gives you a working agent, and you can take either apart into the blocks below.

| Harness | Package | What it provides |
|---|---|---|
| [Coder](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/coder/) | Harness | A complete coding-agent stack: files, shell, repo context, planning, a read-only explorer sub-agent, and context controls |
| [Researcher](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/researcher/) | Harness | A complete web-research stack: search, page fetching, a delegated sub-researcher, and bounded tool output |

### Execution environments

The workspace the agent acts in: the files it edits and the commands it runs, local or isolated.

| Capability | Package | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [FileSystem](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/filesystem/) | Harness | Read, write, edit, search files under a root; path-traversal and symlink safe, secrets read-only |
| [Shell](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/shell/) | Harness | Command execution with allowlists, denylists, timeouts, and credential-stripping |
| [Modal Sandbox](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/modal-sandbox/) | Harness | Commands and files in an isolated [Modal](https://modal.com) cloud sandbox |

### Tools & native abilities

Connections to systems outside the agent's workspace, and abilities the provider executes natively.

|---|---|---|
| [Thinking](thinking.md) | Core | Provider-adaptive extended thinking at configurable effort |
| [Planning](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/planning/) | Harness | Model-owned task plans with a cache-safe live reminder |

| [Dynamic Workflow](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/dynamic-workflow/) | Harness | The model orchestrates sub-agents from one Python script: fan-out, chain, vote in a single tool call, with hard `max_agent_calls` budgets |
| [Advisor](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/advisor/) | Harness | Let an executor consult a stronger model mid-run |

### Context management

How the agent spends its context window: the difference between an agent that degrades over a long run and one that doesn't, and between paying for tokens N times or once.

| Capability | Package | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Code Mode](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/code-mode/) | Harness | The model writes one Python script that calls many tools inside a [Monty](https://github.com/pydantic/monty) sandbox: one round-trip instead of N, and intermediate results never enter the context window |
| [Tool Search](tool-search.md) | Core | Load tool definitions on demand instead of carrying hundreds in every prompt |
| [Compaction](compaction.md) | Core | Provider-native compaction on OpenAI and Anthropic; the provider summarizes history server-side |
| [Compaction](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/compaction/) | Harness | Model-agnostic strategies: tool-result clearing, sliding-window trimming, LLM summarization, tiered; all window-relative, with live usage reporting |
| [Tool Output Limits](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/tool-output-limits/) | Harness | Truncate, spill to a queryable file, or summarize oversized tool returns at the source |
| [Warn On Cache Busts](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/warn-on-cache-busts/) | Harness | Detect prompt-cache prefix collapses between requests, from the provider's own numbers |

### Knowledge & memory

What the agent knows and remembers, loaded when relevant instead of carried in every prompt.

| Capability | Package | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Memory](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/memory/) | Harness | A persistent, namespaced notebook: bounded prompt injection, on-demand search; in-memory/file/Postgres stores |

| [Skills](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/skills/) | Harness | Load [Agent Skill](on-demand.md) (`SKILL.md`) instructions on demand |
| [Repo Context](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/repo-context/) | Harness | Start runs oriented: `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` + repository structure |
| [Pydantic AI Docs](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/pydantic-ai-docs/) | Harness | On-demand Pydantic AI documentation lookup |

### Control & safety

Bounding what the agent may do, and keeping it on-instructions.

| Capability | Package | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Guardrails](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/guardrails/) | Harness | Validate/block/redact user input, tool calls, tool results, and output, including secret masking and parallel async guards |
| [Spend Limits](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/spend/) | Harness | Cross-window USD/token budgets and per-response cost tracking, per model and per tenant |

| [System Reminders](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/system-reminders/) | Harness | Cache-safe re-injection of guidance mid-run to counter instruction fade |

### Self-extension

| Capability | Package | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Capability Creation](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/capability-creation/) | Harness | The agent writes, validates, and persists *new capabilities* during a run, loaded on the next run: self-extension with typed, inspectable units instead of arbitrary code |

### Execution runtime

Outside the loop: how runs persist, survive failures, and get observed and configured in production.

| Capability | Package | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Durable execution](../durable_execution/overview.md) | Core | Runs that survive restarts and failures on [Temporal](../durable_execution/temporal.md), [DBOS](../durable_execution/dbos.md), or [Prefect](../durable_execution/prefect.md), with [Restate](../durable_execution/restate.md), [Kitaru](../durable_execution/kitaru.md), and [Airflow](../durable_execution/airflow.md) integrations |
| [Step Persistence](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/step-persistence/) | Harness | Save, restore, resume (`continue_run`), and fork (`fork_run`) runs; file/SQLite/Mongo backends |
| [Instrumentation](instrumentation.md) | Core | OpenTelemetry GenAI spans for every model and tool call; the raw material for [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) traces |
| [Managed Prompt](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/managed-prompt/) | Harness | Back instructions with a [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire)-managed prompt; version and roll out without redeploying |
| [Thread Executor](thread-executor.md) | Core | Run sync tools on a shared thread pool |

### Loop customization

Core also ships capabilities for customizing the agent loop itself, mostly for production servers:

| Capability | Package | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [Hooks](../hooks.md) | Core | Decorator-based lifecycle hook registration |
| [Select Model](select-model.md) | Core | Select a static or per-step model with a callable |
| [Resolve Model ID](resolve-model-id.md) | Core | Resolve custom, application-specific model IDs with a callable |
| [Prepare Tools / Prepare Output Tools](prepare-tools.md) | Core | Filter or modify function and [output tool][pydantic_ai.output.ToolOutput] definitions per step |
| [Prefix Tools](prefix-tools.md) | Core | Wrap a capability and prefix its tool names |
| [Include Tool Return Schemas](include-tool-return-schemas.md) | Core | Include return type schemas in tool definitions sent to the model |
| [Set Tool Metadata](set-tool-metadata.md) | Core | Merge metadata key-value pairs onto selected tools |
| [Raise Content Filter Error](raise-content-filter-error.md) | Core | Raise [`ContentFilterError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.ContentFilterError] whenever a model response has `finish_reason='content_filter'` |
| [Reinject System Prompt](reinject-system-prompt.md) | Core | Reinject the configured system prompt when the incoming message history is missing one |
| [Process History](process-history.md) | Core | Wrap a [history processor](../message-history.md#processing-message-history) |
| [Process Event Stream](process-event-stream.md) | Core | Forward [agent stream events](process-event-stream.md) to a handler function |

The authoring primitives, [`Capability`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.Capability] for [bundling behavior without subclassing](#bundling-behavior-with-capability) and [`Toolset`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.Toolset] for wrapping an [`AbstractToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.AbstractToolset], are covered below. [ACP](https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness/acp/) *(experimental, Harness)* serves any agent to editors like Zed over the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com). Capabilities that can be declared in [YAML/JSON agent specs](../agent-spec.md#capability-spec-syntax) are listed there.

```python {title="native_capabilities.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import Thinking, WebSearch

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-fable-5',
    instructions='You are a research assistant. Be thorough and cite sources.',
    capabilities=[
        Thinking(effort='high'),
        WebSearch(local='duckduckgo'),
    ],
)
```

[Instructions](../agent.md#instructions) and [model settings](../agent.md#model-run-settings) are configured directly via the `instructions` and `model_settings` parameters on `Agent` (or [`AgentSpec`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentSpec]). Capabilities are for behavior that goes beyond simple configuration — tools, lifecycle hooks, and custom extensions. They compose well, especially when you want to reuse the same configuration across multiple agents or load it from a [spec file](../agent-spec.md).

## Bundling behavior with `Capability`

You don't need a subclass to define a capability of your own: [`Capability`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.Capability] bundles instructions, function tools, and [toolsets](../toolsets.md) declaratively — think of it as defining a skill:

```python {title="capability_shorthand.py"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import Capability

refunds = Capability(
    id='refunds',
    description='Use for refund eligibility and refund status.',
    instructions='Always confirm the order ID before issuing a refund.',
)


@refunds.tool_plain
def refund_status(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Look up the refund status for an order."""
    return f'Order {order_id}: refund issued on 2026-05-01.'


agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.6-sol', capabilities=[refunds])
```

Add `defer_loading=True` and the bundle becomes an [on-demand capability](on-demand.md) that stays collapsed to a one-line catalog entry until the model loads it — like [Agent Skills](on-demand.md#loading-skills-from-markdown-files), which you can wrap in a `Capability` directly. See [The `Capability` convenience class](on-demand.md#the-capability-convenience-class) for the full API. For behavior beyond instructions, tools, and toolsets — lifecycle hooks, model settings, native tools — subclass [`AbstractCapability`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.AbstractCapability] as covered in [Building Custom Capabilities](custom.md).

## Provider-adaptive tools

[`WebSearch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebSearch], [`WebFetch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebFetch], [`ImageGeneration`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ImageGeneration], [`XSearch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.XSearch], and [`MCP`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.MCP] each cover a single capability (web search, URL fetch, image generation, X search, MCP) across two implementations:

- **Native** — invoked by the model provider when the model supports it. The work happens on the provider's side (e.g. Anthropic's web search runs server-side, returning results inline).
- **Local** — runs in your Python process. Used when the model doesn't support the native tool; your code does the work (e.g. calling DuckDuckGo directly).

| Capability | Local fallback | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [`WebSearch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebSearch] | `local='duckduckgo'` or `local=True` (DuckDuckGo) | Requires the `duckduckgo` optional group |
| [`WebFetch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebFetch] | `local=True` (markdownify-based fetch) | Requires the `web-fetch` optional group |
| [`ImageGeneration`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ImageGeneration] | Subagent via `fallback_model=` | Delegates to a model that supports native image generation |
| [`XSearch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.XSearch] | Subagent via `fallback_model=` | No default non-xAI fallback; set `fallback_model` to an xAI model that supports [`XSearchTool`][pydantic_ai.native_tools.XSearchTool] |
| [`MCP`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.MCP] | Direct connection to the MCP server (the default) | Accepts any [`MCPToolset`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPToolset] input; transport is auto-detected from a URL |

Because these capabilities contribute model-facing tools, their `id`, `description`, and `defer_loading` fields are meaningful: set them when that tool should stay hidden until the model loads the matching workflow with the `load_capability` tool. This includes [`ImageGeneration`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.ImageGeneration] when image generation should only be available for an image-specific workflow, whether it resolves to a native image tool or a fallback subagent tool.

Configure each side via the `native=` and `local=` kwargs. `native=` accepts `True` (use the capability's default [native tool](../native-tools.md) instance), `False` (disable native), or an explicit instance like `WebSearchTool(...)` for fine-grained config. `local=` accepts `True` (the bundled local fallback, on capabilities that have one — `WebSearch` and `WebFetch`), `False` (disable local), a named strategy string where supported, or any callable, [`Tool`][pydantic_ai.tools.Tool], or [`AbstractToolset`][pydantic_ai.toolsets.AbstractToolset]. Optional installs needed for the local fallback are opt-in — the capability raises a [`UserError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError] at construction (with an install hint) when you ask for a local strategy whose extra isn't installed.

```python {title="provider_adaptive_tools.py" test="skip" lint="skip"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import MCP, ImageGeneration, WebFetch, WebSearch, XSearch

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-fable-5',
    capabilities=[
        # Native when supported; DuckDuckGo fallback on unsupported models
        WebSearch(local='duckduckgo'),
        # Native when supported; markdownify-based fallback on unsupported models
        WebFetch(local=True),
        # Native when supported; subagent fallback via `fallback_model`
        ImageGeneration(fallback_model='openai:gpt-5.6-sol'),
        # Native on xAI; on other models, explicitly delegate to an xAI model
        XSearch(fallback_model='xai:grok-4.3'),
        # Runs the MCP server locally by default; pass `native=True` to also advertise native MCP
        MCP('https://mcp.example.com/api'),
    ],
)
```

`MCP` defaults the other way from the others: because MCP carries credentials, it runs locally by default and you opt into native MCP with `native=True`. The others default to native and you opt into local with `local=`.

[`XSearch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.XSearch] is slightly different from [`WebSearch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebSearch] and [`WebFetch`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.WebFetch]: there is no default non-xAI fallback. If your agent is not running on an xAI model, set `fallback_model` explicitly to an xAI model that supports [`XSearchTool`][pydantic_ai.native_tools.XSearchTool].

Some constraint fields require the native tool (the bundled local fallback can't enforce them) — passing them locks the capability to the native path. If the model doesn't support the native tool, the capability raises a [`UserError`][pydantic_ai.exceptions.UserError].

```python {title="constraints.py" test="skip" lint="skip"}
# Limit to 5 searches per run — requires native (the local fallback can't track call count)
WebSearch(max_uses=5)

# Only fetch example.com — enforced locally when native is unavailable
WebFetch(allowed_domains=['example.com'], local=True)
```

### Building your own

All five capabilities are subclasses of [`NativeOrLocalTool`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.NativeOrLocalTool], which you can use directly or subclass to build your own provider-adaptive tools. For example, to pair [`CodeExecutionTool`][pydantic_ai.native_tools.CodeExecutionTool] with a local fallback:

```python {title="custom_native_or_local.py" test="skip" lint="skip"}
from pydantic_ai.native_tools import CodeExecutionTool
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import NativeOrLocalTool

cap = NativeOrLocalTool(native=CodeExecutionTool(), local=my_local_executor)
```

## Third-party capabilities

Third-party packages publish capabilities of their own — see [Third-Party Capabilities](third-party.md) for the ecosystem, and [Publishing capabilities](custom.md#publishing-capabilities) for making your own capability available to others.
