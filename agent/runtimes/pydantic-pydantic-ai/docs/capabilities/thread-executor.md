# Thread Executor

The [`UseThreadExecutor`][pydantic_ai.capabilities.UseThreadExecutor] [capability](overview.md) provides a custom [`Executor`][concurrent.futures.Executor] for running sync tool functions and other sync callbacks in threads. This is useful in long-running servers (e.g. FastAPI) where the default ephemeral threads from [`anyio.to_thread.run_sync`][anyio.to_thread.run_sync] can accumulate under sustained load:

```python {test="skip"}
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import UseThreadExecutor

executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=16, thread_name_prefix='agent-worker')
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', capabilities=[UseThreadExecutor(executor)])
```

See [Thread executor for long-running servers](../tools-advanced.md#thread-executor-for-long-running-servers) for more details.
