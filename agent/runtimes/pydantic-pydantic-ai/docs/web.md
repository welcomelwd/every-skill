# Web Chat UI

Pydantic AI includes a built-in web chat interface that you can use to interact with your agents through a browser.

![Web Chat UI](img/web-chat-ui.png)

For CLI usage with `clai web`, see the [CLI - Web Chat UI documentation](cli.md#web-chat-ui).

!!! note
    The web UI is meant for local development and debugging. In production, you can use one of the [UI Event Stream integrations](ui/overview.md) to connect your agent to a custom frontend.

## Installation

Install the `web` extra (installs Starlette and Uvicorn):

```bash
pip/uv-add 'pydantic-ai-slim[web]'
```

## Basic Usage

Create a web app from an agent instance using [`Agent.to_web()`][pydantic_ai.agent.Agent.to_web]:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2', instructions='You are a helpful assistant.')

@agent.tool_plain
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    return f'The weather in {city} is sunny'

app = agent.to_web()
```

Run the app with any ASGI server:

```bash
uvicorn my_module:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7932
```

## Configuring Models

You can specify additional models to make available in the UI. Models can be provided as a list of model names/instances or a dictionary mapping display labels to model names/instances.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.anthropic import AnthropicModel

# Model with custom configuration
anthropic_model = AnthropicModel('claude-sonnet-4-5')

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

app = agent.to_web(
    models=['openai:gpt-5.2', anthropic_model],
)

# Or with custom display labels
app = agent.to_web(
    models={'GPT 5.2': 'openai:gpt-5.2', 'Claude': anthropic_model},
)
```

## Native Tool Support

Configure [native tools](native-tools.md) on the agent with `capabilities=[NativeTool(...)]` to expose them as options in the UI (shown only for models that support each tool):

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import NativeTool
from pydantic_ai.native_tools import CodeExecutionTool, WebSearchTool

agent = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5.2',
    capabilities=[NativeTool(CodeExecutionTool()), NativeTool(WebSearchTool())],
)

app = agent.to_web(models=['anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6'])
```

!!! note "Memory Tool"
    The `memory` native tool is not supported via `to_web()` or `clai web`. If your agent needs memory, configure the [`MemoryTool`][pydantic_ai.native_tools.MemoryTool] directly on the agent at construction time.

## Extra Instructions

You can pass extra instructions that will be included in each agent run:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

app = agent.to_web(instructions='Always respond in a friendly tone.')
```

## Tool Approval

Tools that [require approval](deferred-tools.md#human-in-the-loop-tool-approval) are surfaced in the UI as approve/reject prompts: when the agent calls such a tool, the UI renders the pending call and lets you approve or deny it before the run continues. This works out of the box — no extra configuration is needed.

!!! warning
    The chat endpoint executes tool approvals relayed by the client, including for tools marked `requires_approval=True`. The server trusts the approval decision it receives, so a client with direct access to the endpoint can approve any pending call. As noted above, the web UI is meant for local development — this is fine when it's bound to localhost, but do not expose `to_web()` to untrusted clients without putting authentication in front of it.

## Reserved Routes

The web UI app uses the following routes which should not be overwritten:

- `/` and `/{id}` - Serves the chat UI
- `/api/chat` - Chat endpoint (POST, OPTIONS)
- `/api/configure` - Frontend configuration (GET)
- `/api/health` - Health check (GET)

The app cannot currently be mounted at a subpath (e.g., `/chat`) because the UI expects these routes at the root. You can add additional routes to the app, but avoid conflicts with these reserved paths.

## Custom HTML Source

By default, the web UI is fetched from a CDN and cached locally. You can provide `html_source` to override this for offline usage or enterprise environments.

For offline usage, download the html file once while you have internet access:

```python
from pydantic_ai.ui import DEFAULT_HTML_URL

print(DEFAULT_HTML_URL)  # Use this URL to download the UI HTML file
#> https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@pydantic/ai-chat-ui@2.0.0/dist/index.html
```

You can then download the file using the URL printed above:

```bash
curl -o ~/pydantic-ai-ui.html <chat_ui_url>
```

Then use `html_source` to point to your local file or custom URL:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5.2')

# Use a local file (e.g., for offline usage)
app = agent.to_web(html_source='~/pydantic-ai-ui.html')

# Or use a custom URL (e.g., for enterprise environments)
app = agent.to_web(html_source='https://cdn.example.com/ui/index.html')
```
