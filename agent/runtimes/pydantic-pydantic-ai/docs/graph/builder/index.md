# Graph Builder API

The graph builder API provides a powerful builder pattern for constructing parallel execution graphs. The original [`BaseNode`][pydantic_graph.basenode.BaseNode]-based graph API is still available (and interoperable with the builder API) and is documented in the [main graph documentation](../../graph.md).

## Overview

The graph builder API in `pydantic-graph` provides:

- **Step nodes** for executing async functions
- **Decision nodes** for conditional branching
- **Spread operations** for parallel processing of iterables
- **Broadcast operations** for sending the same data to multiple parallel paths
- **Join nodes and Reducers** for aggregating results from parallel execution

This API is designed for advanced workflows where you want declarative control over parallelism, routing, and data aggregation.

## Installation

The graph builder API is included with `pydantic-graph`:

```bash
pip install pydantic-graph
```

Or as part of `pydantic-ai`:

```bash
pip install pydantic-ai
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python {title="simple_counter.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import GraphBuilder, StepContext


@dataclass
class CounterState:
    """State for tracking a counter value."""

    value: int = 0


async def main():
    # Create a graph builder with state and output types
    g = GraphBuilder(state_type=CounterState, output_type=int)

    # Define steps using the decorator
    @g.step
    async def increment(ctx: StepContext[CounterState, None, None]) -> int:
        """Increment the counter and return its value."""
        ctx.state.value += 1
        return ctx.state.value

    @g.step
    async def double_it(ctx: StepContext[CounterState, None, int]) -> int:
        """Double the input value."""
        return ctx.inputs * 2

    # Add edges connecting the nodes
    g.add(
        g.edge_from(g.start_node).to(increment),
        g.edge_from(increment).to(double_it),
        g.edge_from(double_it).to(g.end_node),
    )

    # Build and run the graph
    graph = g.build()
    state = CounterState()
    result = await graph.run(state=state)
    print(f'Result: {result}')
    #> Result: 2
    print(f'Final state: {state.value}')
    #> Final state: 1
```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" — you'll need to add `import asyncio; asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_

## Key Concepts

### GraphBuilder

The [`GraphBuilder`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.GraphBuilder] is the main entry point for constructing graphs. It's generic over:

- `StateT` - The type of mutable state shared across all nodes
- `DepsT` - The type of dependencies injected into nodes
- `InputT` - The type of initial input to the graph
- `OutputT` - The type of final output from the graph

### Steps

Steps are async functions decorated with [`@g.step`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.GraphBuilder.step] that define the actual work to be done in each node. They receive a [`StepContext`][pydantic_graph.step.StepContext] with access to:

- `ctx.state` - The mutable graph state
- `ctx.deps` - Injected dependencies
- `ctx.inputs` - Input data for this step

### Edges

Edges define the connections between nodes. The builder provides multiple ways to create edges:

- [`g.add()`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.GraphBuilder.add] - Add one or more edge paths
- [`g.add_edge()`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.GraphBuilder.add_edge] - Add a simple edge between two nodes
- [`g.edge_from()`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.GraphBuilder.edge_from] - Start building a complex edge path

### Start and End Nodes

Every graph has:

- [`g.start_node`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.GraphBuilder.start_node] - The entry point receiving initial inputs
- [`g.end_node`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.GraphBuilder.end_node] - The exit point producing final outputs

## A More Complex Example

Here's an example showcasing parallel execution with a map operation:

```python {title="parallel_processing.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import GraphBuilder, StepContext, reduce_list_append


@dataclass
class ProcessingState:
    """State for tracking processing metrics."""

    items_processed: int = 0


async def main():
    g = GraphBuilder(
        state_type=ProcessingState,
        input_type=list[int],
        output_type=list[int],
    )

    @g.step
    async def square(ctx: StepContext[ProcessingState, None, int]) -> int:
        """Square a number and track that we processed it."""
        ctx.state.items_processed += 1
        return ctx.inputs * ctx.inputs

    # Create a join to collect results
    collect_results = g.join(reduce_list_append, initial_factory=list[int])

    # Build the graph with map operation
    g.add(
        g.edge_from(g.start_node).map().to(square),
        g.edge_from(square).to(collect_results),
        g.edge_from(collect_results).to(g.end_node),
    )

    graph = g.build()
    state = ProcessingState()
    result = await graph.run(state=state, inputs=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    print(f'Results: {sorted(result)}')
    #> Results: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    print(f'Items processed: {state.items_processed}')
    #> Items processed: 5
```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" — you'll need to add `import asyncio; asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_

In this example:

1. The start node receives a list of integers
2. The `.map()` operation fans out each item to a separate parallel execution of the `square` step
3. All results are collected back together using [`reduce_list_append`][pydantic_graph.join.reduce_list_append]
4. The joined results flow to the end node

## Next Steps

Explore the detailed documentation for each feature:

- [**Steps**](steps.md) - Learn about step nodes and execution contexts
- [**Joins**](joins.md) - Understand join nodes and reducer patterns
- [**Decisions**](decisions.md) - Implement conditional branching
- [**Parallel Execution**](parallel.md) - Master broadcasting and mapping

## Advanced Execution Control

Beyond the basic [`graph.run()`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.Graph.run] method, the builder API provides fine-grained control over graph execution.

### Step-by-Step Execution

Use [`graph.iter()`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.Graph.iter] to execute the graph one step at a time:

```python {title="step_by_step.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import GraphBuilder, StepContext


@dataclass
class CounterState:
    value: int = 0


async def main():
    g = GraphBuilder(state_type=CounterState, output_type=int)

    @g.step
    async def increment(ctx: StepContext[CounterState, None, None]) -> int:
        ctx.state.value += 1
        return ctx.state.value

    @g.step
    async def double_it(ctx: StepContext[CounterState, None, int]) -> int:
        return ctx.inputs * 2

    g.add(
        g.edge_from(g.start_node).to(increment),
        g.edge_from(increment).to(double_it),
        g.edge_from(double_it).to(g.end_node),
    )

    graph = g.build()
    state = CounterState()

    # Use iter() for step-by-step execution
    async with graph.iter(state=state) as graph_run:
        print(f'Initial state: {state.value}')
        #> Initial state: 0

        # Advance execution step by step
        async for event in graph_run:
            print(f'{state.value=} | {event=}')
            #> state.value=0 | event=[GraphTask(node_id='increment', inputs=None)]
            #> state.value=1 | event=[GraphTask(node_id='double_it', inputs=1)]
            #> state.value=1 | event=[GraphTask(node_id='__end__', inputs=2)]
            #> state.value=1 | event=EndMarker(_value=2)
            if graph_run.output is not None:
                print(f'Final output: {graph_run.output}')
                #> Final output: 2
                break
```

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" — you'll need to add `import asyncio; asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_

The [`GraphRun`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.GraphRun] object provides:

- **Async iteration**: Iterate through execution events
- **`next_task` property**: Inspect upcoming tasks
- **`output` property**: Check if the graph has completed and get the final output
- **`next()` method**: Manually advance execution with optional value injection

### Visualizing Graphs

Generate Mermaid diagrams of your graph structure using [`graph.render()`][pydantic_graph.graph_builder.Graph.render]:

```python {title="visualize_graph.py"}
from dataclasses import dataclass

from pydantic_graph import GraphBuilder, StepContext


@dataclass
class SimpleState:
    pass


g = GraphBuilder(state_type=SimpleState, output_type=str)

@g.step
async def step_a(ctx: StepContext[SimpleState, None, None]) -> int:
    return 10

@g.step
async def step_b(ctx: StepContext[SimpleState, None, int]) -> str:
    return f'Result: {ctx.inputs}'

g.add(
    g.edge_from(g.start_node).to(step_a),
    g.edge_from(step_a).to(step_b),
    g.edge_from(step_b).to(g.end_node),
)

graph = g.build()

# Generate a Mermaid diagram
mermaid_diagram = graph.render(title='My Graph', direction='LR')
print(mermaid_diagram)
"""
---
title: My Graph
---
stateDiagram-v2
  direction LR
  step_a
  step_b

  [*] --> step_a
  step_a --> step_b
  step_b --> [*]
"""
```

The rendered diagram can be displayed in documentation, notebooks, or any tool that supports Mermaid syntax.

## Comparison with Original API

The original graph API (documented in the [main graph page](../../graph.md)) uses a class-based approach with [`BaseNode`][pydantic_graph.basenode.BaseNode] subclasses. The builder API uses a builder pattern with decorated functions, which provides:

**Advantages:**
- More concise syntax for simple workflows
- Explicit control over parallelism with map/broadcast
- Native reducers for common aggregation patterns
- Easier to visualize complex data flows

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires understanding of builder patterns
- Less object-oriented, more functional style

Both APIs are fully supported and can even be integrated together when needed.

## Persistence and Resumability

!!! info "No Native Persistence"
    Unlike the [original Graph API](../../graph.md), the graph builder API does not include built-in state persistence. This is due to the [complexity of achieving consistent snapshotting with parallel execution](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/issues/530#issuecomment-3504609992).

For workflows that need to preserve progress across failures, restarts, or long-running operations, use one of the supported [durable execution](../../durable_execution/overview.md) solutions.
