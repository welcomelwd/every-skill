description: "Security review of UI-adapter PRs (Vercel AI + AG-UI): audits the client/server trust boundary for outbound leakage and inbound abuse. Inline comments + a non-voting COMMENT-type review summary (CI Review owns the merge-gate verdict until gh-aw check-runs land). Prompt iterable from a Logfire managed variable; read-only via gh-aw safe-outputs."
on:
  # Runs on EVERY PR (no `paths:` filter) so the review's check is always
  # reported on the head commit. The UI-path selection moved into the `detect`
  # job below: non-UI PRs skip the agent via `if:` (a job skipped by `if:`
  # reports as success, so it never blocks merge), while UI PRs gate the agent
  # behind the `ui-security-review` Environment (required reviewers) — a
  # maintainer clicks "Approve" to start the AI run, and the pending approval
  # blocks merge until the review has run. `synchronize` is kept so a new
  # commit re-reports the check on the new head and re-pends the approval.

  # Fork-PR safety: only trigger when the actor has admin/maintainer/write
  # access. Without this, any established external contributor's PR would
  # consume the configured Anthropic key and a model run.
  roles: [admin, maintainer, write]
  # Pause for a maintainer's approval of the `ui-security-review` Environment
  # before the agent runs. This gates the `activation` job, but because
  # `activation` is itself gated by the `if:` below, the approval is only
  # requested on UI-touching PRs (a skipped job never requests Environment
  # approval). The pending approval keeps the agent's required check pending,
  # blocking merge until a maintainer clicks Approve to start the review.
  manual-approval: ui-security-review
# Only run the review (and request approval) when the PR touches the UI
# security surface. Non-UI PRs skip the activation chain, so the agent reports
# "skipped" (= success for required checks) and never blocks merge.
#
# `detect` MUST also be referenced from the prompt body below, or this gate
# inverts into an unconditional skip. gh-aw copies this `if:` onto `activation`,
# but only adds jobs referenced by the PROMPT to `activation.needs`; a job named
# only here resolves to empty there, `activation` skips, and `detect` — which the
# compiler makes depend on `activation` — skips with it, taking the agent down
# too. That is why this workflow had never once run its agent (#6766 item 7).
