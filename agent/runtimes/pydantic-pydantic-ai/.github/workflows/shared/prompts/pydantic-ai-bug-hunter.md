# Pydantic AI Bug Hunter

## Objective

Find a single reproducible, user-impacting bug that can be covered by a minimal
failing test. Not a number field accepting `"ABC"` — a real, impactful bug.

**The bar is high: you must actually reproduce the bug before filing.** Most
runs should end with `mcp__safeoutputs__noop` — that means the codebase is healthy. Filing a
weak or speculative issue is worse than filing nothing.

### Data Gathering

1. Review recent changes: run `git log --since="28 days ago" --stat` and
   identify candidates with user-facing impact. Read the diffs and related
   files for each candidate.
2. Investigate from multiple angles — different subsystems (model providers,
   the agent loop, tools, output handling, message history), different bug
   categories (logic errors, type-safety gaps, async edge cases), and
   different recent commits.
3. Reproduce locally — **mandatory, not optional**:
   - Write a **new** minimal reproduction: a small script or test that directly
     triggers the specific bug you identified. Do **not** run the existing
     suite (`make test`, `pytest`) and report its failures — if you did not
     write the test, a failure is not your finding.
   - Capture the exact steps and output from your reproduction.
   - If you cannot write a concrete reproduction that fails due to the bug, do
     **not** file it. Call `mcp__safeoutputs__noop` instead.

### What to Look For

- Logic errors: incorrect conditionals, off-by-one, wrong variable, missing
  edge-case handling.
- Clear user impact: wrong output, raised/swallowed exception, broken agent
  run, incorrect tool dispatch, mis-serialized message history.
- Deterministic reproduction (not flaky) that you trigger yourself.
- Expressible as a minimal failing test (unit or integration).

### What to Skip

- Theoretical concerns without a reproduction — no "this looks like it could break."
- Code that "looks wrong" but works correctly in practice.
- Existing test-suite failures you did not cause.
- Edge cases needing unusual or undocumented inputs.
- Issues requiring large refactors or design changes.
- Behavior already tracked by an open issue.
- **By-design behavior.** Check for nearby comments explaining the choice,
  consistent patterns across the codebase, and recent PRs/commits for context.
  If the "bug" requires assuming an error despite an established pattern, it is
  probably by-design.
- **Cross-provider comparisons.** Different providers have different semantics
  by design. Do not assume one provider's behavior is the "correct" reference
  for another. Only flag a bug if the behavior contradicts the provider's own
  documented API contract.

### Deduplication — mandatory BEFORE filing an issue

Search the open-issue corpus prefetched before the sandbox started for issues
that might overlap your run's scope:

```
jq '.[] | {number, title, labels: [.labels[].name], url}' \
  /tmp/gh-aw/agent/github-context/open-issues.json
```

Scan titles for the generated prefixes (`[bug-hunter]`,
`[provider-mapping-sweep]`, `[streaming-resilience-sweep]`, `[roundtrip-sweep]`)
and scan both titles and `labels[].name` for keywords related to whatever
subsystem you're investigating.
If a matching issue already covers the same root cause, call
`mcp__safeoutputs__noop` immediately — do NOT file a duplicate, even to
"independently confirm" the bug. Confirming is not value-add.

Do not enumerate issues with `gh` from inside the sandbox; list requests can
stall until the workflow times out.

### Sandbox notes

- Read files in large ranges (500+ lines per call). Do NOT read 30–80 lines at a time.
- Use the native `Grep` and `Glob` tools for codebase search.

### Quality Gate — When to Noop

Call `mcp__safeoutputs__noop` if any of these are true:
- You could not write a concrete reproduction that triggers the bug.
- Your only evidence is an existing test failure you did not cause.
- The bug is speculative — inferred from reading code, not triggered.
- A similar issue is already open.
- The impact is cosmetic or low-severity (e.g., a typo in a log message).
- The bug is already fixed in a recently merged PR (search before filing).

### Issue Format

**Title:** Short bug summary

**Body:**

> ## Impact
> [Who/what is affected, why it matters]
>
> ## Reproduction Steps
> 1. [Exact commands you ran, including the new test or script you wrote]
>
> ## Expected vs Actual
> **Expected:** ...
> **Actual:** ... [include actual command output]
>
> ## Failing Test
> [The new test/script you wrote — include the full code]
>
> ## Evidence
> - [Commands/output captured, file references with `path:line`]
>
> ## Adversarial review
> - **Reproduced on `main`:** [exact command + real captured output]
> - **Existing tests checked:** [tests read; none assert the current behavior, and the fix doesn't break them]
> - **Ruled out by-design:** [nearby comment / profile / maintainer decision / same in other providers]
> - **SDK verified for this provider:** [the real type/shape, not inferred by analogy to another provider]
> - **Not a duplicate:** [open-issue scan returned nothing covering this]
