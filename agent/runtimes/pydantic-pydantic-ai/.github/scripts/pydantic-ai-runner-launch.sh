# The checked-out workspace is mounted no-exec in the AWF sandbox, so this
# script is installed into gh-aw's exec-able /tmp/gh-aw/bin/ by the workflow's
# pre-step (`install -m 755 ... /tmp/gh-aw/bin/pydantic-ai-runner-launch`).
# It is gh-aw's `engine.command` for every Pydantic AI agentic workflow and
# `uv run --script`s the in-tree runner stub with the agent's argv. The stub
# (`pydantic-ai-runner`) is a tiny `runpy` shim that hands off to the
# `pydantic_ai_gh_aw_shim` package in the same directory.
#
# AWF propagates setup-* tool paths into the container via $GITHUB_PATH and
# /opt/hostedtoolcache — so `uv` and `rg` should be on PATH already. The
# launcher just sets up the uv cache dirs (the default cache dir from
# setup-uv isn't writable by the sandbox user UID 1001).
