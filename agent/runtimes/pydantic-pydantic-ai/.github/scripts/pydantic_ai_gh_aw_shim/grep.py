r"""Claude's `Grep` tool -- recursively regex-search workspace files.

Runs ripgrep through pydantic-ai-harness's `ShellToolset` -- the same shell
capability that backs `Bash` -- instead of a hand-rolled subprocess: the harness
owns process execution, the sandbox PATH, output truncation, and the timeout,
while ripgrep keeps its speed and `.gitignore` filtering (a poor fit for the
harness's own `FileSystemToolset.search_files`, which walks every non-dotfile
including vendored/ignored trees and matches with Python `re`). The
directory-scoped AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md context blocks are still prepended.

Two adapters bridge a shell command back into a grep tool:

- Containment. `ShellToolset` roots the cwd at the workspace but, unlike the
  harness `FileSystemToolset`, does not validate the `path` argument, so a bare
  `rg -- ../..` could escape `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`. `path` is preflighted through
  the filesystem capability -- the same containment `Read`/`Glob`/`LS` enforce.

- Framing. `run_command` frames output as `[stdout]` / `[stderr]` blocks and
  appends `\n[exit code: N]` only on a non-zero exit. ripgrep exits 1 on "no
  matches" (not an error) and 2+ on a real error, so the exit code -- not the
  presence of `[stdout]` -- is what the adapter keys off, unwrapping the generic
  framing back into a grep-shaped result.
