"""Tool approval with AG-UI interrupts.

Demonstrates the AG-UI interrupt lifecycle: a tool declared with `requires_approval=True`
pauses the run when the model proposes a call. The adapter emits `RUN_FINISHED` with
`outcome.type == "interrupt"`; the client renders an approval UI from `outcome.interrupts[]`
and posts a follow-up `RunAgentInput` carrying `resume[]` to approve, deny, or edit the call.

Requires `ag-ui-protocol >= 0.1.19`. See https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/interrupts.
