"""Realtime camera + voice assistant: a browser bridged to a provider-agnostic realtime session.

The browser streams microphone PCM, one camera frame per second, and typed text over a WebSocket;
the server forwards them into a [realtime session](https://ai.pydantic.dev/realtime/overview/) and
streams model audio, transcripts, and tool results back. The spine is the two pumps in
`_run_session`; everything else is configuration and optional demo features: **Watch** (proactive
narration of scene changes), **web search** with citation chips, and **sketch redrawing** through a
second agent.

Set the API key for the model you want to talk to — `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for the default Gemini model,
`OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI, or the `AZURE_OPENAI_*` variables for Azure OpenAI — in a `.env` at the
repo root, then run:

    uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.realtime_camera.app

and open http://localhost:8000 on the same machine. `CAMERA_REALTIME_MODEL` sets the default model
(the UI's model picker takes any `provider:model` per session); see README.md for the other
`CAMERA_*` settings, Vertex AI credentials, and how the bridge works.

This is a development example: the WebSocket checks browser origins so other sites can't drive your
session, but there is no authentication — don't expose the server to the internet.
