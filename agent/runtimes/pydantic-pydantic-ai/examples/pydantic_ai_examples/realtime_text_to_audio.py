"""Type a text prompt, hear the model speak the reply — the simplest realtime session.

A realtime speech-to-speech model doesn't only listen to a microphone: you can send it plain
text and have it reply with speech. This is the text-in / audio-out path of a realtime session,
and the smallest possible way to try one out — no audio hardware required.

This opens a realtime session with OpenAI's `gpt-realtime` model, sends your text prompt, streams
back the spoken reply while printing the transcript as it arrives, and saves the audio to a `.wav`
file you can play afterwards.

Sending text into an OpenAI realtime session immediately asks the model to respond, so there's no
microphone, voice-activity detection, or manual turn-taking to manage — just `send()` and iterate.

It needs an OpenAI API key set via `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Run with:

    uv run -m pydantic_ai_examples.realtime_text_to_audio "Tell me a fun fact about octopuses."
