Values:

- `'auto'`: Let the provider decide — typically means "use a higher tier (scale credits, priority capacity)
  when available, otherwise standard." On providers without a server-side auto concept the field is
  omitted so the provider's natural default applies.
- `'default'`: Explicitly request the provider's standard tier — opts out of any server-side
  auto-promotion to premium tiers.
- `'flex'`: Lower-cost, latency-tolerant tier where the provider offers one. Silently ignored on
  providers that don't (e.g. Anthropic) — though a few reject the field outright rather than ignore it,
  as noted on the [`service_tier`][pydantic_ai.settings.ModelSettings.service_tier] entries.
- `'priority'`: Higher-priority / lower-latency tier where the provider offers one. Silently ignored
  on providers that don't.

Per-provider mapping:

| value | OpenAI | Anthropic | Bedrock | Google (Gemini API) | Google Cloud |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `'auto'` | `'auto'` | `'auto'` | _(omitted)_ | _(omitted)_ | _no headers (PT then on-demand)_ |
| `'default'` | `'default'` | `'standard_only'` | `{'type': 'default'}` | `'standard'` | _no headers (PT then on-demand)_ |
| `'flex'` | `'flex'` | _(omitted)_ | `{'type': 'flex'}` | `'flex'` | header `Shared-Request-Type: flex` (PT then Flex PayGo) |
| `'priority'` | `'priority'` | _(omitted)_ | `{'type': 'priority'}` | `'priority'` | header `Shared-Request-Type: priority` (PT then Priority PayGo) |

On Google Cloud the unified field maps only to safe PT-with-spillover variants so customers with
Provisioned Throughput keep using their reserved capacity first; to bypass PT entirely use
[`google_cloud_service_tier`][pydantic_ai.models.google.GoogleModelSettings.google_cloud_service_tier]
with `'flex_only'` or `'priority_only'`. Likewise, provider-specific values not in the unified set
(Bedrock's `'reserved'`, Anthropic's `'standard_only'`, Google Cloud's PT routing tiers) are reachable
only through the per-provider field.

`google_cloud_service_tier`) always take precedence over this unified field when set.

    [`OpenAIResponsesModel`][pydantic_ai.models.openai.OpenAIResponsesModel]; a name qualified with an
