[`TestEmbeddingModel`][pydantic_ai.embeddings.TestEmbeddingModel] are not affected by this setting, nor is
[`SentenceTransformerEmbeddingModel`][pydantic_ai.embeddings.sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformerEmbeddingModel],
which runs inference locally and so has no per-call provider cost.

    2. `with_native` matches an *unsupported* native tool → shed `with_native`. The tool is
       a member of a corpus the native tool would have managed; with that native tool absent
       the membership means nothing, and an adapter deriving a wire flag from it would emit
       the flag unpaired and earn a rejection.
    3. `defer_loading` remains authored intent; this function resolves its provider representation
       into `tool_visibility` exactly once. A caller without a `can_withhold_tool_schemas` answer
       (the realtime session path) can't withhold schemas at all.

    On top of the filter, two narrower drops apply, kept independent:

    * `optional=True` only governs the *unsupported-on-this-model* path: an unsupported
      optional native tool is silently dropped (no error raised). It does NOT govern the
      corpus-empty drop.
    * The corpus-empty drop is specific to the framework-managed tool-search native tool's
      corpus-management role: an *optional* `ToolSearchTool` is dropped when nothing is
      searchable, since sending it with no corpus to search would waste a tool slot. A
      non-optional `ToolSearchTool` stays — the user asked explicitly. Other native tools
      don't have a corpus and aren't subject to this drop, so making `optional` a base-class
      field doesn't accidentally cause e.g. `WebSearchTool(optional=True)` to be dropped here.

    This is a module-level function rather than a `Model` method so both the classic agent-run
    path (via `Model._resolve_request_tools`, which passes its profile-derived
    `_can_withhold_tool_schemas` and `tool_addition_mode`) and the realtime session path can
    share it — `RealtimeModel` is not a `Model` subclass.

    Reached through [`Model._trim_before_compaction`][pydantic_ai.models.Model._trim_before_compaction],
    which derives both flags from the adapter's declarations; adapters call that from their own
    message-prep step, since where in a request build the trim belongs is provider mechanics.
    Anthropic ignores (and doesn't bill) pre-boundary blocks,
    so there the trim only saves request size; the OpenAI Responses API processes and bills
    replayed items that precede a compaction item (live-verified), so there it is what makes
    compaction actually compact. `requires_encrypted_content` is this caller's own render condition,
    passed to the shared wire-boundary predicate: a part the adapter would omit must not act as a
    boundary either, or the history is dropped with nothing sent to stand in for it.

    The standing prompt survives via `_standing_prompt_request`; nothing else from the prefix does.
    `standing_prompt_retained` mirrors where the calling API carries the standing prompt: on
    Anthropic the top-level `system` parameter is rebuilt from the opening `SystemPromptPart`s on
    every request, so they must be re-inserted (`False`, the default) or the standing prompt is
    silently dropped from all subsequent requests. On OpenAI Responses those parts render as
    `system` input items *inside* the compacted window, and the compaction item demonstrably
    retains them — a latent directive that never fired before the boundary still governs
    post-compaction replies without the item being re-sent (live-verified) — so ordinary requests
    pass `True` and skip re-sending what the model would receive twice. `True` is honored only for
    a boundary part stamped with `STANDING_PROMPT_PLANTED_KEY`: retention presumes the compacted
    window contained the standing prompt, which only our own compact call guarantees — an
    externally produced or spliced-in item gets the standing prompt re-inserted as before.
    Retention is also only reliable for a single hop: a directive carried solely by a previous
    compaction item decayed when compacted again (live-verified), so the re-compaction call itself
    passes `False` to plant the standing prompt explicitly in every freshly built window (and
    stamps the result). Recovered instructions are re-sent either way — they travel as a
    per-request parameter, never inside the window.
    The Messages API accepts a request whose messages start with the assistant compaction block
    (live-verified), and keeping e.g. the original first user message can 400 when it carries a
    `tool_result` whose `tool_use` was trimmed away — validation runs even on ignored content.
    Idempotent: re-applying to an already-trimmed list is a no-op.

    Providers with a native way to say "these tools just appeared" get it rendered natively. The rest
    used to get a fabricated `search_tools` call/return pair, which told the model it had run a search
    it never ran. That was wrong in three ways, and all three go away by stating the fact instead:

    * It attributed an action to the model. In a mixed corpus — some tools searchable, some gated
      behind a capability — a capability load rendered as a search claims the wrong cause.
    * It could reference a `search_tools` tool that isn't on the wire, since the corpus-empty drop
      removes it when nothing is searchable. Some providers reject a history naming an undeclared tool.
    * It had to fabricate a `tool_call_id`, and two deltas over the same tool names produced the same
      one — duplicate ids in a history that providers requiring uniqueness reject.

    A `SystemPromptPart` also stays inside the delta's own message, where the pair had to be spliced
    across two messages: the fabricated `ModelResponse` went in ahead of the rebuilt `ModelRequest`,
    so a delta sharing a request with a user prompt put the assistant's turn before it and reordered
    the conversation. Within that message the announcements render after the request's tool results.

    On a model that takes a mid-conversation system message this lands as a real one, carrying the
    operator authority the statement deserves; elsewhere `_wrap_non_leading_system_prompts` — which
    runs after this — degrades it to `<system>`-tagged user text. Either way it's append-only, so the
    cached prefix ahead of it survives.
