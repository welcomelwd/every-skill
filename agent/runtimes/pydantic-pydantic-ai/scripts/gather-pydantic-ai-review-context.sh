# Gather PR context for the CI Review agent into $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/.review-context/.
# Usage: scripts/gather-pydantic-ai-review-context.sh <pr-number> [repo]
#
# Examples:

#   scripts/gather-pydantic-ai-review-context.sh 4269 pydantic/pydantic-ai
#
# Why outputs live at the workspace ROOT, and not under /tmp or `.github/`:
# the agent's `Read` tool refuses any path outside the workspace, so a `/tmp`
# destination makes every instructed read fail (#6766 measured ~15 failed
# `Read` calls per run, in 80 of 80 sampled runs). But gh-aw's pre-agent flow
# also runs a "Save/Restore agent config folders from base branch" step that
# rewrites `.github/` (and `.agents`, `.claude`, `.codex`, …) from the BASE
# branch, so anything written inside those is liable to be wiped or shadowed.
# The workspace root satisfies both: readable by the agent, untouched by the
# restore.
#
# TODO(consolidate): This is a fork of scripts/gather-review-context.sh used
# by the legacy Claude-action workflow (.github/workflows/bots.yml). The two
# will be consolidated once the Claude-action workflow is migrated to the
# Pydantic AI gh-aw shim — until then, keep edits scoped to whichever consumer
# needs them and leave the other script alone.

# Pydantic AI PR Review — Shared Review Conventions

This file is the **single source of truth** for the severity scale, false-
positive catalog, calibration examples, and sub-agent output format. The
parent PR-review agent and every Task sub-agent should `Read` this file
once before reviewing.

## Severity scale

Determine severity AFTER investigating the finding, not before.

- 🔴 **CRITICAL** — must fix before merge. Security vulnerability, data
  corruption, public-API break without deprecation, type-safety hole
  that would silently mistype user code.
- 🟠 **HIGH** — should fix before merge. Logic bug with a concrete
  failure trigger, missing validation at an external boundary, race
  condition, significant perf regression, broken backward compatibility.
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** — address soon, non-blocking. Error-handling gap with
  an unlikely trigger, missing test for a non-trivial code path, subtly
  surprising behavior, docs that contradict the code.
- ⚪ **LOW** — author discretion. Minor improvements, missing docstrings
  on small helpers, narrow refactor opportunities.
- 💬 **NITPICK** — truly optional. Naming preferences, comment polish.

**Verdict mapping:** any HIGH or CRITICAL → `REQUEST_CHANGES`. MEDIUM-only
or below → `APPROVE` (post the comments anyway). No findings → `APPROVE`.

**Cap inline comments at 30 per run.** If more findings survive, keep the
highest-severity 30 inline and list the rest briefly in the review body.

## What NOT to flag

This repo runs ruff and pyright in CI and has expert maintainers. The
common false-positive patterns below all *look* like real issues — verify
the surrounding code before posting.

- **Style / formatting** — ruff handles it.
- **Type nits already covered by pyright** — `make typecheck` runs in CI.
- **Coverage-gate / `# pragma: no cover` predictions** — coverage is
  deterministic and CI reports it exactly: the `fail_under = 100` job names
  every uncovered `file:line`, and a strict-no-cover audit flags a
  `# pragma: no cover` sitting on a line that was actually covered. Don't
  flag "this drops below 100%", "removing this pragma breaks coverage", or
  "this pragma is wrong/unneeded" — CI catches all of these clearly. (A
  missing test for genuinely *new* behavior or public API is still fair
  game — that's about correctness, not the coverage number. A profile-gated
  branch whose added tests all pin one side of the flag is fair game too
  (Example 4): the branch line can read at 100% while the flag-on and
  flag-off *combination* stays unverified, so it is a value-combination gap,
  not a coverage-percentage prediction.)
- **"Missing tests" for pure refactor** — if the PR moves or renames
  existing code and existing tests still exercise the behavior, no new
  test is needed. Only flag missing tests for new behavior or new public
  API, which includes a newly added or modified `profile.get(...)` branch
  under `models/` (Example 4): that is new behavior, not a move.
- **`None` / `Optional` access guarded upstream** — internal helpers
  often assume a precondition the caller enforces (or a type narrows the
  value via an `assert` / `isinstance` / early-return). Read the caller
  before flagging.
- **Internal renames** — anything with a leading underscore (or in a
  module that starts with `_`) is private. Renaming or removing private
  surface is fine; only flag breakage of *public* API.
- **Provider-specific knobs** — request params, role mappings, finish
  reasons differ deliberately across providers. Check the provider's
  SDK docs (or recent commits in `pydantic_ai/models/<provider>.py`)
  before asserting a "bug".
- **Cassettes / `uv.lock` / generated files** — never review.
- **Theoretical performance** — `O(n²)` is only a problem if `n` is
  realistically large in this use case. Don't flag without evidence of
  real-world impact.
- **Validation already enforced by Pydantic** — if the input is a
  Pydantic model, don't flag missing manual validation of its fields.
- **"This might break some user"** — if you can't name the user, the
  call site, or the scenario, drop the finding.

## Calibration examples

### Example 1 — `None` access

**Flag this (HIGH):**
```python
# PR adds a new public helper
def first_text_message(messages: list[ModelMessage]) -> str:
    for m in messages:
        for p in m.parts:
            if isinstance(p, TextPart):
                return p.content
```
*Why:* The function is typed `-> str` but falls off the end and implicitly
returns `None` when no `TextPart` is found, so any caller that does
`.upper()` on the result silently breaks at runtime. Public API.

**Don't flag this:**
```python
# PR adds this line inside agent.run() after the model call
text = response.parts[-1].content
```
*Why:* Reading the surrounding code shows `_validate_response` runs
before this line and guarantees `parts` is non-empty and the last part
is text-bearing. The "missing None check" is handled at the layer above.

### Example 2 — provider mapping

**Flag this (HIGH):**
```python
# PR adds tool_call mapping for a new provider
return ToolCallPart(tool_name=tc.name, args=tc.input)
```
*Why:* Every other provider sets `tool_call_id=tc.id` for round-trip
identity; the new mapping silently drops it, breaking tool-result
pairing for any agent that uses multi-tool calls.

**Don't flag this:**
```python
# PR adds reasoning-effort mapping
if model_settings.reasoning_effort:
    request['reasoning'] = {'effort': model_settings.reasoning_effort}
```
*Why:* Even though OpenAI uses `reasoning_effort` at the top level,
this provider's SDK docs (check `pydantic_ai/models/<provider>.py`
neighbouring code) show the nested `reasoning.effort` shape is correct
for this provider. Different providers, different shapes — not a bug.

### Example 3 — backward compatibility

**Flag this (CRITICAL):**
```python
# PR renames a public method on Agent
- def run_sync(self, ...): ...
+ def sync_run(self, ...): ...
```
*Why:* `Agent.run_sync` is widely used public API. Removing it without
a deprecation shim breaks every user on upgrade.

**Don't flag this:**
```python
# PR renames an internal helper
- def _build_request(...): ...
+ def _assemble_request(...): ...
```
*Why:* Leading underscore = private. Internal refactors don't need
deprecation.

### Example 4 — profile-flag test pinning

Trigger: the diff adds or modifies a `profile.get(...)` read under
`pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/models/`, and the tests plus cassettes the same
diff adds pin that flag to a single value. Decide it by calling the provider's
profile function for each pinned model and reading the flag.

**Flag this (MEDIUM):**
```python
# PR adds a background-mode include gated on a profile flag under models/...
if profile.get('openai_supports_encrypted_reasoning_content'):
    include.append('reasoning.encrypted_content')
# ...and every test and cassette the same PR adds pins `gpt-4o`.
```
*Why:* The new branch only runs when the flag is on, but
`openai_model_profile('gpt-4o').get('openai_supports_encrypted_reasoning_content')`
is `False`, so every added test sits on the flag-off side and the flag-on
branch ships unverified. Coverage does not catch this: the line is exercised
by other tests and reads at 100%, yet the (flag on) × (this path) combination
is never visited. Ask for one added test pinning a model on the other side (a
reasoning model, e.g. `gpt-5.6` or `o3`, for which the flag is `True`), or an
in-test note saying why that side is unreachable on this path. MEDIUM and
advisory: post the comment, never `REQUEST_CHANGES`.

**Don't flag this:**
```python
# Same branch, and the PR adds one test pinning `gpt-4o` plus one pinning `o3`.
```
*Why:* The added tests pin a model on each side of the flag
(`openai_model_profile('gpt-4o')` is `False`, `openai_model_profile('o3')` is
`True`), so both paths are covered. Also don't flag when the diff pins one
value but a comment in the added test explains why the other side is
unreachable on this path, or when the touched `profile.get(...)` read is not a
new or modified branch (a pure move or rename).

## Sub-agent finding format

When a Task sub-agent returns findings, use this exact format (one block
per finding):

```
- file: path/to/file.py
  line: 42
  severity: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | NITPICK | CRITICAL
  title: one-line title
  body: one-paragraph problem statement + concrete failure scenario
  suggestion: (optional) concrete code suggestion
```

Return an empty list if no finding applies.

echo ""
echo "Context gathered in ${CTX}/:"
ls -lh "$CTX/"
DIFF_COUNT=$(find "$CTX/diff" -name '*.diff' 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
echo "  Per-file diffs: ${DIFF_COUNT} files in ${CTX}/diff/"
