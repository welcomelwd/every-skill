# Contributing to Switchyard

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines the development workflow, testing practices, and code standards.

## External Contributions

We welcome contributions of all sizes, from typo fixes to new features. The short version:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Switchyard/fork) and clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Switchyard.git
   cd Switchyard
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Switchyard.git
   ```

2. Pick the right process for the size of your change:
   - **Small changes** (typos, docs, focused bug fixes under ~100 lines): open a PR directly, no issue needed.
   - **Larger changes** (new features, refactors, anything 100+ lines): [open an issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Switchyard/issues/new/choose) first so maintainers can confirm the direction before you invest time.

3. Create a branch, make your change, and run the checks in [Code standards](#2-code-standards).

4. Commit with a DCO sign-off (see [Signing Your Work](#signing-your-work)):

   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "fix: description of the change"
   ```

5. Push to your fork and open a PR against `main`, linking any related issues (e.g. "Closes #42").

Review is requested automatically from the core team via [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS), so there is no need to pick reviewers. Keep each PR focused on one concern, include tests for behavior changes, and respond to feedback with follow-up commits rather than force-pushes.

Using AI tools to write code is fine, but you must understand and be able to explain every change in your PR.

## Setup

See [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md) for full setup instructions.

Quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Switchyard.git
cd Switchyard
uv sync
uvx pre-commit install --install-hooks --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branch naming

Use one of these prefixes for clarity:

- `feature/...` — new functionality
- `fix/...` — bug fixes
- `docs/...` — documentation updates
- `refactor/...` — non-functional code changes
- `test/...` — test additions or improvements

Example: `feature/add-new-router-backend` or `fix/async-context-leak`

### 2. Code standards

All code must pass these gates before a PR is merged:

```bash
# Linting — zero errors required
uv run ruff check .

# Type checking — strict mode
uv run mypy switchyard

# Tests — no failures
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

These commands run in CI on every push. **Fix linting errors locally before pushing:**

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix .
```

### 3. Commit messages

Commit messages must follow
[Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
This is enforced locally by the `commit-msg` hook and in GitHub Actions.

Every commit must also carry a DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`), enforced by the
required DCO check on every PR. See [Signing Your Work](#signing-your-work).

- ✓ `fix: handle async context cleanup in ProxyContext`
- ✓ `feat: add stage-router routing backend`
- ✗ `Fixed stuff` / `Updated code`

Use one of:

- `build:` — build system or packaging changes
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `ci:` — CI configuration
- `docs:` — documentation
- `refactor:` — code structure (no behavior change)
- `test:` — test additions
- `perf:` — performance improvement
- `chore:` — tooling, dependencies, CI
- `revert:` — revert a previous commit
- `style:` — formatting-only changes

Scopes are optional: `fix(cli): preserve command arguments`.
Breaking changes use `!` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```text
feat(api)!: remove legacy route option
```

### 4. Pull request process

1. **Create a feature branch** off `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Write tests** for new functionality or bug fixes. Tests live in `tests/`:
   - Unit tests: `tests/test_*.py`

3. **Run the full test suite locally** before pushing:
   ```bash
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run mypy switchyard
   uv run pytest tests/ -v
   ```

4. **Push and open a PR** on GitHub. Include:
   - Clear description of the change and why
   - Link to any related issues (e.g., "Closes #42")
   - Test coverage notes

5. **Address review feedback** — push additional commits (don't force-push unless explicitly asked).

6. **Squash and merge** when approved. One commit per feature keeps history clean.
   Keep the PR title conventional too, because GitHub can use the PR title for
   the squash-merge commit.

The `CI Success` and `DCO` status checks are required on `main`; the other
workflows (commitlint, PR title) run on every PR but are advisory.

## Testing

### Unit tests (fast, no API keys)

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Integration tests (requires API keys)

Integration tests hit live LLM APIs. Set credentials before running:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# or NVIDIA_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY depending on the backend you target
```

The default unit test suite runs with no network access and no API keys. Live, end-to-end tests are not currently part of the public CI pipeline.

## Architecture

See [Agents](AGENTS.md) for the full architecture guide. Key points:

- **Typed requests/responses** — use `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse` subtypes
- **Composable chain** — `RequestProcessor` → `LLMBackend` → `ResponseProcessor` → `TranslationEngine`
- **Profiles** — pre-built chains in `switchyard/lib/profiles/`

When adding a new component:

1. Decide the role: `RequestProcessor`, `LLMBackend`, `ResponseProcessor`, or translation engine work.
2. Subclass the ABC from `switchyard/lib/roles.py`.
3. Put Python middleware in the matching subpackage (`switchyard/lib/processors/`, `switchyard/lib/backends/`) and provider translation logic in `crates/switchyard-translation`.
4. Add tests in `tests/`.
5. Export from the relevant `__init__.py` and from `switchyard/__init__.py`'s `__all__`.

## Documentation

- **Code comments** — explain the *why*, not the *what*. One line max unless complex.
- **Docstrings** — include for public APIs. Format: one-line summary, blank line, details, examples.
- **README** — keep in sync with CLI surface (commands, flags, new subcommands).
- **docs/** — architecture, design decisions, advanced usage.
