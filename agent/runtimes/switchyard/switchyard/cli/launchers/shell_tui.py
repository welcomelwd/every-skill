"""Embed a child process in a PTY with a live footer drawn below it.

Uses DECSTBM to confine the child's output to the upper rows and a
background thread to repaint the footer at a fixed refresh rate.

The footer function signature::

    footer_fn(cols: int) -> list[tuple[str, int]]

Each tuple is ``(styled_line, visible_width)`` — the visible width
excludes ANSI escape sequences so padding is applied correctly for
lines that contain colour codes or multi-cell emoji.
