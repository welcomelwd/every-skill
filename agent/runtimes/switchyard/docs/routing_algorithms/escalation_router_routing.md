# Escalation-Router Routing

Escalation routing starts each conversation on a cheaper weak model. An LLM judge
reads how the work is going and latches the session to a strong model when it
detects sustained trouble.

Use it for multi-turn agent workloads where a weak model handles routine work but
may need rescue after repeated errors, loops, or drift. Unlike plain
[LLM Classifier Routing](llm_classifier_routing.md), which predicts how difficult
a request looks before running it, escalation judges whether the run is actually
going well.

## Configure an escalation route

```toml
schema_version = 1

[llm_clients.openrouter]
format = "openai_chat"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

[targets.judge]
id = "google/gemini-3.5-flash"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[targets.strong]
id = "anthropic/claude-opus-4.7"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[targets.weak]
id = "moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[routes.agent]
id = "agent"
type = "llm_classifier"
mode = "escalation"
classifier_target = "judge"
strong_target = "strong"
weak_target = "weak"
prompt = "Judge whether the weak model is stuck. Return the required structured verdict."
escalation = { confirmations = 2, recent_turn_window = 28, window_message_chars = 500 }
```

`classifier_target` is the judge. The route's `id`, `agent`, is the model name
clients send; the judge is not exposed as a client-selectable model.

The route-level `prompt` key replaces the packaged trajectory-judge prompt. It
uses the escalation verdict schema rather than the capability verdict schema.
Switchyard sends that schema separately through the provider's structured-output
request rather than copying it into the prompt.

## How the decision works

For each turn on an unlatched session, Switchyard:

1. Calls the weak target and buffers its reply.
2. Appends that reply to the transcript and asks the judge to rule on the
   completed turn. The judge therefore rates work the weak model actually did,
   not a prediction about work it might do.
3. Increments a consecutive-escalate streak on an escalate verdict, and resets it
   to zero on a decline.
4. Serves the buffered weak reply when the streak has not yet reached
   `confirmations` — so a judged turn that does not escalate costs one weak call
   plus one judge call, and no strong call.
5. Discards the buffered weak reply and serves the strong target instead once the
   streak reaches `confirmations`. That turn is billed for a weak call, a judge
   call, and a strong call.

A latched session routes straight to the strong target with no judge call:

```mermaid
%%{init: {"flowchart": {"nodeSpacing": 18, "rankSpacing": 26}}}%%
flowchart LR
    t["turn"] --> p{"streak >= confirmations?"}
    p -->|yes| s["route strong; skip judge"]
    p -->|no| c["call weak, buffer reply"]
    c --> j["judge the completed turn"]
    j -->|decline: streak = 0| w["serve buffered weak reply"]
    j -->|escalate, not yet confirmed| w
    j -->|escalate, confirmed| l["discard weak reply; serve strong"]

    classDef box font-family:monospace,fill:none,stroke:#9aa0a6,stroke-width:1px;
    class t,p,s,c,j,w,l box;
```

A judge that times out, errors, or returns an unparseable verdict fails open: the
turn serves the buffered weak reply and the existing streak is held rather than
cleared. A judge failure never creates a strong-tier latch.

## Judge model compatibility

The trajectory judge uses the same response contract and provider/model
compatibility guidance as the LLM classifier judge. See
[Judge model compatibility](llm_classifier_routing.md#judge-model-compatibility).

## Tuning options

The judge exposes three settings. Their defaults are the benchmarked
configuration, so a bare `escalation = {}` is a valid, tuned route:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `confirmations` | `2` | Consecutive escalate verdicts required before the session latches to strong. Must be at least `1`. |
| `recent_turn_window` | `28` | Trailing messages shown to the judge on top of the anchors. Must be at least `1`. |
| `window_message_chars` | `500` | Per-message truncation cap inside that trailing window. Must be at least `50`. |

`confirmations` is the main cost dial. `1` latches sooner and spends more on the
strong tier. `2` or higher requires a session identity, because the streak is
retained per session — without one, every turn starts from zero and the route
never latches. Clients supply it with `x-switchyard-session-id`.

Anchor and transcript caps remain fixed. Set the route-level
`max_output_tokens` key to change the judge's reply budget. Any decline still
resets the streak to zero.

## Run the route

After installing the Rust server, as described in
[Getting Started](../getting_started.md#install-the-server), export the provider
credential, validate the configuration, and start the binary:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
switchyard-server --config routes.toml --dry-run
switchyard-server --config routes.toml \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000
```

Send a request using the route ID, supplying a session identity so the streak
persists across turns:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-switchyard-session-id: demo-session" \
  -d '{"model":"agent","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'
```

Invalid settings are rejected when the configuration loads rather than on the
first request, so `--dry-run` catches them.

## Observability

Read the standard stats endpoint:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:4000/v1/stats
```

The snapshot reports per-model calls, tokens, latency, and cost for the strong
and weak tiers. Judge calls are recorded in the classifier stats bucket, so their
token cost and latency remain visible as routing overhead.

When the server runs with a routing log, successful judge calls also appear in
per-session routing stats under the judge's model id, tagged with the
`classifier` tier — so per-session token accounting includes judge overhead
alongside the tiers the session was served by.

## When not to use escalation routing

- **One-shot requests.** No trajectory to judge. Use
  [LLM Classifier Routing](llm_classifier_routing.md) in `capability` mode.
- **Traffic without session identity.** With `confirmations` above `1`, the route
  cannot accumulate a streak and never latches.
- **Fixed traffic experiments.** Use [Random Routing](random_routing.md).
- **Per-turn stage optimization.** Use
  [Stage-Router Routing](stage_router_routing.md) when signals should move
  individual turns in both directions.
- **Latency-critical traffic.** An unlatched turn waits for the weak call and then
  the judge call.
