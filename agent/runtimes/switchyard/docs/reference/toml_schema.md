# TOML Schema

The native deployment file defines the LLM clients, targets, and routes a
Switchyard server serves. It is read by `switchyard-server --config` and by
`switchyard launch --config`.

Validate a file without starting the server:

```bash
switchyard-server --config routes.toml --dry-run
```

## Minimal Example

```toml
schema_version = 1

[llm_clients.openrouter]
format = "openai_chat"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"

[targets.strong]
id = "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5"
llm_client = "openrouter"

[routes.default]
id = "switchyard"
type = "passthrough"
target = "strong"
```

`schema_version` must be `1`. Table names under `llm_clients`, `targets`, and
`routes` are local references; clients send the route's `id` as the model name.

`schema_version`, `[targets]`, and `[routes]` must all be present, even when a
route reaches no upstream. A file without a `[targets]` table is rejected with
`missing field targets`; an empty `[targets]` table satisfies it.
`[llm_clients]` defaults to empty and may be omitted.

## `[llm_clients.<name>]`

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `format` | Yes | — | `openai_chat`, `openai_responses`, or `anthropic_messages`. |
| `base_url` | Yes | — | Upstream base URL. |
| `api_key_env` | No | unset | Name of the environment variable holding the key. Omit to send no authentication. |
| `extra_headers` | No | `{}` | Extra HTTP headers sent upstream. |
| `max_retries` | No | `2` | Retry budget, `0`–`10`. |

The TOML never contains the secret itself. `api_key_env` names a variable that
must exist and be non-empty when the server loads.

## `[targets.<name>]`

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | — | Exact model ID sent upstream. |
| `llm_client` | Yes | — | Key under `[llm_clients]`. |
| `extra_body` | No | `{}` | Values merged into the upstream request when the request does not already set that key. |

## `[routes.<name>]`

Every route takes the common keys below, plus the keys for its type.

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | — | Public model ID that callers send in requests. |
| `type` | Yes | — | Routing algorithm for this route. |
| `context_window` | No | unset | Positive token count advertised for this route by `GET /v1/models`. Unset values appear as `null`. This does not enforce a request limit. |
| `tool_calling` | No | unset | Whether `GET /v1/models` advertises tool-calling support for this route. Unset values appear as `null`. |
| `reasoning` | No | unset | Whether `GET /v1/models` advertises reasoning support to Codex direct-provider discovery. Unset routes are advertised as non-reasoning. |

### `noop`

Returns a buffered assistant response containing `OK` without calling an
upstream model. Use it for local smoke tests.

A noop-only deployment reaches no upstream but still needs the `[targets]`
table, which can be empty:

```toml
schema_version = 1

[targets]

[routes.smoke]
id = "noop-route"
type = "noop"
```

### `passthrough`

Sends every request to one target.

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|
| `target` | Yes | Target every request is sent to. |

### `random`

Splits traffic across targets. See
[Random Routing](../routing_algorithms/random_routing.md).

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `targets` | Yes | — | Target names to choose from. |
| `weights` | No | equal | Finite, non-negative relative weights in `targets` order, with at least one positive value. Invalid weights are rejected at load time. |
| `seed` | No | unset | Reproduces the selection sequence. |

### `llm_classifier`

Runs one of three judge-backed modes: `capability`, `escalation`, or `custom`.
`classifier_target` and `max_output_tokens` apply to all three.

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `mode` | No | `capability` | Classifier behavior. Set it explicitly for new configurations. |
| `classifier_target` | Yes | — | Target the judge is called through. Not a routing destination. |
| `max_output_tokens` | No | `4096` | Maximum completion tokens for the judge verdict. Must be at least `1`. |

Capability mode classifies before serving. See
[LLM Classifier Routing](../routing_algorithms/llm_classifier_routing.md).

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `strong_target` | Yes | — | Capable tier. |
| `weak_target` | Yes | — | Efficient tier. |
| `base_threshold` | Yes | — | Lowest solve probability that routes to the weak target. In `[0, 1]`. |
| `threshold_step` | No | `0.0` | Finite, non-negative amount added once for uncertain or unmatched verdicts and twice for unsupported verdicts. `base_threshold + 2 * threshold_step` must be at most `1`. |
| `session_affinity` | No | `false` | Reuses a session's first decision on later turns. |
| `message_hash_fallback` | No | `false` | Keys affinity on the first user message. Requires `session_affinity`. |
| `recent_turn_window` | No | unset | When unset, the judge sees the opening task and latest user follow-up, when present. When set, it also sees trailing turns. |
| `prompt` | No | packaged prompt | Replaces the capability prompt. The packaged schema is sent separately as structured-output configuration. |

Escalation mode serves the weak target first and judges the completed turn. See
[Escalation-Router Routing](../routing_algorithms/escalation_router_routing.md).

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `strong_target` | Yes | — | Target used after the session latches. |
| `weak_target` | Yes | — | Target served before the latch. |
| `prompt` | No | packaged prompt | Replaces the trajectory-judge prompt. |
| `escalation.confirmations` | No | `2` | Consecutive escalate verdicts required to latch. Above `1` needs a session ID. |
| `escalation.recent_turn_window` | No | `28` | Trailing messages shown to the judge. |
| `escalation.window_message_chars` | No | `500` | Per-message cap inside that window. |

Existing configurations that contain `escalation` but omit `mode` remain valid.

Custom mode validates the judge's JSON against `response_schema`, resolves the
policy selector, and routes to any configured target label.

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `targets` | Yes | — | Two or more target names available to the policy. |
| `default_target` | Yes | — | Target used when the judge fails or its verdict cannot be routed. |
| `prompt` | Yes | — | Judge system prompt. The configured inner schema is sent separately as structured-output configuration. |
| `response_schema` | Yes | — | Inner JSON Schema encoded as a TOML string. Switchyard adds the provider wrapper. |
| `policy` | Yes | — | Policy table. `target_selector` accepts a JSON Pointer such as `/decision/target`. |
| `session_affinity` | No | `false` | Reuses a session's first decision on later turns. |
| `message_hash_fallback` | No | `false` | Keys affinity on the first user message. Requires `session_affinity`. |
| `recent_turn_window` | No | unset | When unset, the judge sees the opening task and latest user follow-up, when present. When set, it also sees trailing turns. |

Classifier prompts must not contain `{{RESPONSE_SCHEMA}}`. Switchyard sends the
schema only through the provider's structured-output request.

### `stage_router`

Scores tool signals to pick a tier per turn. See
[Stage-Router Routing](../routing_algorithms/stage_router_routing.md) for the
optional `handoff_notes` and `classifier` tables and for tuning.

| Key | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `capable_target` | Yes | — | Capable tier. |
| `efficient_target` | Yes | — | Efficient tier. |
| `picker` | Yes | — | `efficient_first`, or `capable_first` (experimental, unbenchmarked). Tier used when the signals are not confident. |
| `confidence_threshold` | Yes | — | Corroboration a decisive pick needs. In `[0, 1]`. |
| `recent_turn_window` | No | `3` | Trailing tool results the signals are computed over. |
| `capable_system_prompt` | No | unset | System prompt handed to the capable tier. |
| `efficient_system_prompt` | No | unset | System prompt handed to the efficient tier. |

## Validation Errors

`--dry-run` prefixes configuration failures with
`invalid server config <path>:`. Within that wrapper, TOML deserialization
errors start with `failed to parse TOML:`, while errors from validating the
built configuration retain their inner message unchanged.
