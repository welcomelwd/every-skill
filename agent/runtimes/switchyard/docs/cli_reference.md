# CLI Reference

Switchyard has two command-line paths:

- **Launcher Path:** `switchyard launch` starts a supported coding agent and
  hosts the native Rust server through the packaged PyO3 binding.
- **Server Path:** `switchyard-server` runs the standalone Rust proxy for API
  clients and custom deployments.

## Launcher Path: `switchyard launch`

Install the launcher with `uv tool install --python 3.10 "nemo-switchyard[cli]"`. The
selected coding agent must also be installed and available on `PATH`.

### Usage

```bash
switchyard launch <agent> --model <route-id> [--config <deployment.toml>] [-- <agent args>]
```

Supported agents are `claude`, `codex`, and `openclaw`.

| Option | Required | Purpose |
|---|:---:|---|
| `--model ID` | Yes | Route ID from the selected deployment. |
| `--config PATH` | No | Native TOML deployment. Defaults to the packaged OpenRouter deployment. |
| `-- ...` | No | Arguments forwarded unchanged to the coding agent. |

### Packaged Deployment

The packaged deployment exposes the route ID `switchyard` and uses OpenRouter:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
switchyard launch claude --model switchyard
switchyard launch codex --model switchyard
switchyard launch openclaw --model switchyard
```

### Custom Deployment

Select a route ID from an explicit native TOML deployment:

```bash
switchyard launch claude --model my-route --config routes.toml
```

The launcher owns the server lifecycle and stops it when the coding agent exits.
This command does not install or run the standalone `switchyard-server` binary.

## Server Path: `switchyard-server`

Install the standalone binary with `cargo install --locked switchyard-server`.
It reads the same native TOML deployment schema accepted by the launcher.

### Usage

```bash
switchyard-server --config <deployment.toml> [options]
```

| Option | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--config PATH` | Required | TOML file defining LLM clients, targets, and algorithm routes. |
| `--host HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Address on which the server listens. |
| `-p, --port PORT` | `4000` | Port on which the server listens. |
| `--backlog BACKLOG` | `65535` | TCP listen backlog configured before accepting traffic. |
| `--shutdown-timeout SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `30s` | Maximum time active requests may drain during shutdown. |
| `--dry-run` | Off | Validate the deployment without binding a socket. |
| `--routing-log-file PATH` | None | Append durable per-request routing records to this JSONL file. |
| `--tls-cert PATH` | None | PEM certificate path; requires `--tls-key`. |
| `--tls-key PATH` | None | PEM private-key path; requires `--tls-cert`. |
| `-h, --help` | — | Print command help. |
| `-V, --version` | — | Print the server version. |

Validate a deployment, then start the proxy:

```bash
switchyard-server --config routes.toml --dry-run
switchyard-server --config routes.toml \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000
```

## Removed Setup Commands

`switchyard configure`, `switchyard serve`, and `switchyard verify` are not
available. Export the
environment variable named by `api_key_env` in the native TOML deployment,
then pass that deployment on each run. For example:

```toml
[llm_clients.provider]
api_key_env = "PROVIDER_API_KEY"
```

```bash
export PROVIDER_API_KEY="your-provider-key"  # pragma: allowlist secret
switchyard launch claude --model my-route --config routes.toml
```

The CLI does not save provider credentials, deployment paths, or host a
standalone server.
Use `switchyard-server --config routes.toml --dry-run` to
validate a native deployment before starting the standalone server.
