# Release Workflow

Audience: Switchyard maintainers who need temporary wheel artifacts or an official PyPI release.

Switchyard currently follows the OSS-style NeMo path for GitHub builds:

- regular CI runs tests, linting, type checks, Rust checks, and slim-install smoke checks;
- manual dev builds create one Linux x86_64 wheel as a one-day GitHub Actions artifact;
- manual dev matrix builds create the full sdist and wheel set as GitHub Actions artifacts;
- root `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags run the complete release validation and wheel matrix;
- public PyPI, crates.io, and GitHub publishing happens only from approved
  `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag releases.

Wheel metadata uses the public distribution name `nemo-switchyard`, while the Python import and CLI
stay `switchyard`.

## Why Dev Builds Are Explicit Opt-In

GitHub dev builds are for validation and review. They should not publish from branch state, and
GitHub Packages is not a PyPI-compatible package index.

Because of those constraints, GitHub dev builds stay as short-lived artifacts. PyPI publishing is
reserved for tag-driven releases because PyPI versions are effectively immutable once uploaded.

## Manual Dev Artifact Build

Use the workflow-dispatch path in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:

```text
Actions -> Build and publish release distributions -> Run workflow
```

Set:

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| `build_dev_artifact` | `true` |
| `dev_version` | `0.0.1.dev0` |

The workflow:

1. Stamps build-local metadata to `version = "0.0.1.dev0"`.
2. Builds one manylinux x86_64 wheel.
3. Uploads `dev-wheel-linux-x86_64` with one-day retention.
4. Downloads the artifact again and verifies the wheel `Name` and `Version` metadata.

## Manual Dev Matrix Artifact Build

Use this to prove the complete release matrix before cutting an official tag:

| Input | Value |
|---|---|
| `build_dev_artifact` | `false` |
| `build_dev_matrix` | `true` |
| `dev_version` | `0.0.1.dev0` |

This path stamps the requested `.dev` version, runs the release checks, builds the sdist, builds the
full abi3 wheel matrix, and uploads the distributions as GitHub Actions artifacts. It does not
publish anything to PyPI.

## Official Release Build

Create a root `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag only when a real release has been approved. Tag pushes run:

- Python release checks on Python 3.10 through 3.14;
- Rust fmt, clippy, and workspace tests;
- source distribution build;
- full abi3 wheel matrix for Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64, macOS x86_64, macOS arm64,
  Windows x86_64, and Windows arm64;
- native wheel smoke installs where the runner can execute the artifact.

The workflow rejects release tags that do not exactly match `pyproject.toml`'s package version. For
example, package version `0.2.0` must be released with the `v0.2.0` tag. The Rust workspace and
Python package versions must also match.

The official `publish` job uses `uv publish --trusted-publishing always`, so PyPI project creation
and uploads require a matching pending trusted publisher:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Project | `nemo-switchyard` |
| Owner | `NVIDIA-NeMo` |
| Repository | `Switchyard` |
| Workflow | `publish.yml` |
| Environment | `pypi` |

Do not create a root release tag until the PyPI pending publisher and GitHub `pypi` environment are
ready.

The same tag publishes these crates to crates.io in dependency order:

1. `switchyard-protocol`
2. `switchyard-libsy`
3. `switchyard-translation`
4. `switchyard-llm-client`
5. `switchyard-server`

Add a repository Actions secret named `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` containing a crates.io API token that
can publish all five crates and create new crates. The job waits for each version to reach the
crates.io index before publishing its dependents. If publication stops partway through, use
GitHub's **Re-run failed jobs** action so successful crate jobs are not repeated.

## Local Metadata Helper

To preview the metadata stamp locally:

```bash
python scripts/release/set_dev_wheel_version.py 0.0.1.dev0 --print-version
python scripts/release/set_dev_wheel_version.py 0.0.1.dev0
```

Do not commit the stamped package metadata unless the release process explicitly requires it.
