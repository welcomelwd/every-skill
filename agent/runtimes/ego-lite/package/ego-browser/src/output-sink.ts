/**
 * Output sink for the agent-facing heredoc runtime.
 *
 * `console.log` is the only channel an agent reads (the runtime routes it here). A
 * single user takeover turns that channel into noise: while the user holds control,
 * every browser command re-reports the same hard-stop error, so a script that loops
 * over work and swallows each error (try/catch, `.catch()`) prints the same guidance
 * on every iteration, buried under its own business logging and success rows.
 *
 * To collapse that to one clean line we buffer console.log output instead of writing it
 * straight through. When a hard-stop error is born (see `buildEgoError`) we record its
 * owned message once. At the end of the run we either:
 *   - a hard stop occurred -> discard the whole buffer and emit the owned message once
 *   - otherwise            -> flush the buffered output verbatim
 * and in both cases append the update-notice trailer (if any) last, so an out-of-band
 * "ego lite update available" hint reads as a footer after the command's own output.
 *
 * Buffering is the price of discarding pre-stop output: bytes already written cannot be
 * recalled, so nothing may be written until we know the run did not hard-stop. Each
 * heredoc runs in its own short-lived process, so this module state is per-run and needs
 * no cross-round reset; `resetSink()` exists only so in-process tests can reuse the run.
