## Sandbox Snapshots

In many agentic workflows, you don't need a sandbox running indefinitely, but you need to preserve the exact state of a session—including filesystem changes and memory state—to resume it later.

While standard sandboxes are ephemeral, the `PodSnapshotSandboxClient` allows you to manually "freeze" a gVisor-protected sandbox and restore that state upon resuming the suspended sandbox later.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires a GKE Autopilot cluster with a gVisor node pool. See [GKE Cluster Setup](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-snapshots) for infrastructure setup instructions.

- A GKE Autopilot cluster with a gVisor node pool and necessary CRDs applied.
- Google Cloud credentials configured in your environment.
- The [Agent Sandbox Controller]({{< ref "/docs/getting_started/overview" >}}) installed.
- The [Sandbox Router](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/blob/main/clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/sandbox-router/README.md) deployed in your cluster.
- A `SandboxWarmPool` named `simple-sandbox-pool` applied to your cluster. See the [Python Runtime Sandbox]({{< ref "/docs/runtime-templates/python" >}}) guide for setup instructions.
- The [Python SDK]({{< ref "/docs/python-client" >}}) installed: `pip install k8s-agent-sandbox`.

### Suspend & Resume with Snapshots

Unlike automatic pausing, snapshots give you granular control over when state is saved. This is ideal for multi-turn agents where the environment needs to be "parked" between user prompts to save costs.

#### Basic Workflow Example

The following example demonstrates creating a sandbox, modifying its filesystem, taking a snapshot, and suspending/resuming it to restore the state.

> Note: this example uses `simple-sandbox-pool`, which you should create in your GKE cluster first (along with its backing `simple-sandbox-template`). See the [snapshots example source folder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/tree/main/site/content/docs/sandbox/snapshots/source) for the matching `SandboxTemplate` manifest.

> [!NOTE]
> A sandbox can only be restored from its own previous snapshots (via the `suspend()` and `resume()` lifecycle).
>
> Snapshot/suspend/resume support is Python-only for now. `PodSnapshotSandboxClient` drives this through GKE's `podsnapshot.gke.io` custom resources, which the published Go SDK (`clients/go/sandbox`) doesn't wrap yet — there's no equivalent to add here without reimplementing that orchestration from scratch.

```python
import time
from k8s_agent_sandbox.gke_extensions.snapshots import PodSnapshotSandboxClient

SLEEP_TIME = 10
def sleep():
    print(f"sleep {SLEEP_TIME} sec.")
    time.sleep(SLEEP_TIME)

# 1. Initialize the snapshot-capable client
client = PodSnapshotSandboxClient()

# 2. Create the sandbox
sandbox = client.create_sandbox("simple-sandbox-pool")
print(sandbox)

# 3. Run a command that alters the filesystem (e.g., Playwright caching data)
response = sandbox.commands.run("mkdir -p /tmp/data && echo 'session_active' > /tmp/data/status.txt")
print(response)
sleep()

# 4. Snapshot the Sandbox
# This freezes the gVisor container state.
snapshot_response = sandbox.snapshots.create("my-trigger")
sleep()
assert snapshot_response is not None

print(f"Snapshot saved with ID: {snapshot_response.snapshot_uid}")

# 5. Suspend the Sandbox
# This takes a snapshot and sets the Sandbox's operatingMode to Suspended.
suspend_result = sandbox.suspend(snapshot_before_suspend=True)
assert suspend_result.success
sleep()

# 6. Later, Resume the Sandbox
# This sets the Sandbox's operatingMode back to Running and automatically restores the latest state.
resume_result = sandbox.resume()
assert resume_result.success
assert resume_result.restored_from_snapshot

# 7. Verify the filesystem state was preserved
response = sandbox.commands.run("cat /tmp/data/status.txt")
print(response.stdout) # Should output 'session_active'
```
