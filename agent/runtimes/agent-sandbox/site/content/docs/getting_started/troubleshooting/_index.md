## Troubleshooting Agent Sandboxes

In complex agentic workflows, execution failures can happen at multiple layers—from missing dependencies in your Python environment to network timeouts and cluster-level resource exhaustion. 

While standard errors are often surfaced directly in your script, the `k8s_agent_sandbox` SDK provides specialized tools and methodologies to inspect, trace, and debug your sandbox environments effectively.

> Note: the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/tree/main/site/content/docs/getting_started/troubleshooting/source)

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster with the [Agent Sandbox Controller]({{< ref "/docs/getting_started/overview" >}}) installed.
- The [Sandbox Router](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/blob/main/clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/sandbox-router/README.md) deployed in your cluster.
- A `SandboxWarmPool` named `python-sandbox-pool` (backed by a `SandboxTemplate` named `python-sandbox-template`) applied to your cluster. See the [Filesystem]({{< ref "/docs/filesystem" >}}) guide for a minimal `kubectl apply` example, or the [Python Runtime Sandbox]({{< ref "/docs/runtime-templates/python" >}}) guide.
- The [Python SDK]({{< ref "/docs/python-client" >}}) installed with the tracing extra: `pip install "k8s-agent-sandbox[tracing]"`.

### SDK Logging

When you need granular visibility into the API calls the SDK is making to the Sandbox Router, configure Python logging to show the SDK's built-in log output. This is particularly useful when sandbox creation hangs or connection errors occur.

Example code:

```python
import logging
from k8s_agent_sandbox import SandboxClient

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

client = SandboxClient()
sandbox = client.create_sandbox(warmpool="python-sandbox-pool")
payload = "echo 'Hello World!'"
response = sandbox.commands.run(payload)

print(response)
```

Example output:
```log
Creating SandboxClaim 'sandbox-claim-66ae1a5e' in namespace 'default' using warm pool 'python-sandbox-pool'...
2026-04-15 16:52:11,634 - INFO - Resolving sandbox name from claim 'sandbox-claim-66ae1a5e'...

```

### Custom Sandbox Images and Output Inspection

Often, agent code fails because the environment lacks necessary system packages or dependencies. If your agent requires a specific setup, you should build a custom Docker image, push it to your registry, and reference it in your Kubernetes `SandboxTemplate`. You must also create a `SandboxWarmPool` that references that template before calling `create_sandbox(warmpool=...)`.

When executing commands inside this custom environment, the `response` object is your primary debugging tool. It strictly separates standard output, standard error, and the exit code.

#### Output Inspection Example

This example shows how to robustly check the execution results of a command, which is critical when validating custom Docker image behaviors.

```python
from k8s_agent_sandbox import SandboxClient

client = SandboxClient()

# 1. Create a sandbox from a warm pool backed by a template with your custom Docker image
sandbox = client.create_sandbox(warmpool="python-sandbox-pool")

# 2. Run a command that might fail (e.g., executing a script with missing dependencies)
response = sandbox.commands.run("python3 /app/agent_script.py")

# 3. Inspect the execution results
if response.exit_code != 0:
    print(f"Execution Failed with exit code: {response.exit_code}")
    print(f"Error Details (stderr): {response.stderr}")
else:
    print(f"Execution Succeeded!")
    print(f"Output (stdout): {response.stdout}")

sandbox.terminate()
```

The output:
```log
Execution Failed with exit code: 2
Error Details (stderr): python3: can't open file '/app/agent_script.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

### Controller Log Level and Debug Flags

The Agent Sandbox Controller defaults to `info`-level logging. When debugging, you can increase verbosity or enable additional diagnostics by adding arguments to the controller's container spec:

```yaml
containers:
  - name: agent-sandbox-controller
    args:
      - --zap-log-level=debug
      - --enable-pprof-debug
      - --enable-tracing 
```

To view the controller logs after changing the log level:
```bash
kubectl logs -n agent-sandbox-system deployment/agent-sandbox-controller -f
```

### Infrastructure Diagnostics with kubectl

If the Python SDK is timing out before a sandbox is even returned, the issue is likely occurring at the cluster infrastructure layer. Because the SDK interacts with Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) under the hood, `kubectl` is the best way to verify cluster state.

You can run the following commands in your terminal to diagnose the Sandbox Controller and Router.

#### Essential Diagnostic Commands

Check the status of your sandbox templates and warm pools to ensure your custom images are properly registered:
```bash
# Verify the template exists
kubectl get sandboxtemplates

# Verify the warm pool exists and has ready replicas
kubectl get sandboxwarmpools
kubectl describe sandboxwarmpool python-sandbox-pool
```

When `create_sandbox()` hangs, it usually means the controller cannot fulfill the claim (e.g., due to insufficient node resources or an exhausted warm pool). Inspect the claims:
```bash
# List all claims and check if any are stuck in "Pending"
kubectl get sandboxclaims

# Describe a specific pending claim to see event logs and errors
kubectl describe sandboxclaim <claim-name>
```

Finally, the Sandbox Router is responsible for translating the SDK's REST calls into cluster actions. Viewing its logs will reveal deeper backend issues:
```bash
# Locate the sandbox-router pod
kubectl get pods -n default | grep sandbox-router

# Tail the logs for errors
kubectl logs -n default <sandbox-router-pod-name> -f
```
