## To create a kind cluster
```shell
make deploy-kind
```

## Running unit tests
To run all unit tests:
```shell
make test-unit
```
## Running the e2e tests (including benchmarks)
To run all e2e tests:
```shell
make test-e2e
```
## Running only e2e benchmarks
To run only e2e benchmarks:
```shell
make test-e2e-benchmarks
```
## Running Tests with Race Detector

Go unit tests run with Go’s race detector (`-race`) enabled.
E2e tests do not run with -race by default, since the race detector significantly increases memory usage (5-10×) and execution time (2-20×), which would slow down PR presubmits.

To run e2e tests with race detection:

```shell
make test-e2e-race
```
## Remove the kind cluster
```shell
make delete-kind
```
