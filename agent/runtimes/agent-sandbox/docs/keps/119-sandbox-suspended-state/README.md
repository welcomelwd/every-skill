## Motivation

We currently expose a single `Ready` condition for Sandboxes. Because Sandbox acts as an "aggregation" object, a common convention is that `Ready` should be `True` when all child objects (Pod, Service, PVC) are applied to the cluster and are themselves `Ready`. However, relying purely on the `Ready` condition makes it harder to observe certain lifecycle transitions—specifically, when a Sandbox is in the process of suspending or resuming. While a controller or user can observe that a Sandbox should be suspended from `spec.operatingMode` and verify `status.observedGeneration` to know the controller has acted on the spec, they lack a clear signal indicating whether the suspension process is actively happening or if it has fully completed without deeply inspecting the child objects.

Adding the `Suspended` condition explicitly solves this visibility gap for both suspend and resume cycles. This KEP proposes keeping the condition present and toggling it between `True` and `False`, so clients can reliably observe the most recent `lastTransitionTime` for suspend/resume. Additionally, it lays the API groundwork for future enhancements like "soft pause". In a future soft pause scenario, a Sandbox's execution might be paused (e.g., freezing processes via the container runtime) without terminating the underlying Pod. An explicit `Suspended` condition provides a stable, consistent API abstraction to represent this halted state to users and automation, regardless of the underlying technical implementation.

Furthermore, there is a growing need to represent a more diverse and granular status in the Agent Sandbox UI. A richer set of conditions allows the UI to provide clear, user-friendly feedback about the exact stage of a Sandbox's lifecycle, rather than just a simple binary Ready or Not Ready state.

## Condition Hierarchy

The Sandbox state is determined by multiple distinct layers. 

#### 1. `Suspended`
This condition explicitly tracks whether the sandbox environment is currently paused or hibernated. 
* **Status: True** – The Sandbox is no longer actively executing workloads due to a suspension request. The `Reason` field specifies how it is suspended (`PodTerminated`).
* **Status: False** – The Sandbox is active, running, or in a transient lifecycle phase (`NotSuspended`, `PodTerminating`, `PodNotOwned`). `lastTransitionTime` is updated only when the status flips between `True` and `False`, and is retained while the status remains `False` even if the reason/message changes.
* **Status: Unknown** – The Pod's state could not be determined because reconciling the Pod failed (e.g. a failed Get or Delete), so the controller cannot confirm whether the workload is suspended (`PodStateUnknown`). This is distinct from `PodTerminated`: a nil Pod alongside a reconcile error does not prove the Pod is gone.
* **Ready Impact:** The moment a suspension is requested (e.g., `spec.operatingMode: Suspended`), the `Ready` condition immediately transitions to `False` with the reason `SandboxSuspended`. It holds this reason through the entire suspending phase and remains that way once fully suspended. If reconciling the Pod fails, `Ready` instead reports `ReconcilerError`.

#### 2. `Ready` (Root Condition)
The overarching signal for whether all child objects are successfully applied to the cluster and are themselves `Ready`.

## Condition Dependency Matrix

The controller evaluates the hierarchy top-down. The `Suspended` condition remains present across all operational states after its initial transition, utilizing explicit, state-driven reason strings to drive UI and automation clarity.

| Scenario | Suspended Status | Suspended Reason | Pod Object State | **Ready Status** | Ready Reason | Description / UI Visual Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Provisioning** | `False` | `NotSuspended` | nil (Initial build) | **`False`** | `DependenciesNotReady` | Transient State: Sandbox is provisioning for the first time. |
| **Suspending** | `False` | `PodTerminating` | non-nil (Deleting) | **`False`** | `SandboxSuspended` | Transient State: Sandbox suspension requested. Active workloads are being de-provisioned. |
| **Suspension Blocked** | `False` | `PodNotOwned` | non-nil (Unowned/Other) | **`False`** | `SandboxSuspended` | Transient State: Sandbox suspension requested, but blocked because a conflicting Pod exists that is not owned by this Sandbox. |
| **Suspension Unknown** | `Unknown` | `PodStateUnknown` | nil (reconcile failed) | **`False`** | `ReconcilerError` | Error State: Reconciling the Pod failed (e.g. a failed Get/Delete), so a nil Pod cannot be assumed terminated and suspension cannot be confirmed. |
| **Suspended** | `True` | `PodTerminated` | nil (Fully deleted) | **`False`** | `SandboxSuspended` | Stable State: Pod has been successfully terminated. Sandbox is fully suspended. |
| **Resuming** | `False` | `NotSuspended` | nil (Recreating) | **`False`** | `DependenciesNotReady` | Transient State: Sandbox resumption requested. Recreation of underlying workload is in progress. |
| **Operational** | `False` | `NotSuspended` | non-nil (Active) | **`True` / `False`** | `DependenciesReady` / `DependenciesNotReady` | Stable State: Sandbox is active and the underlying Pod has been provisioned. Note: The Pod might be Pending or Failed; we rely on `Ready` and `Finished` to track specific Pod health. |

## Usage Examples

Standard Kubernetes tooling can now interact with the sandbox state natively and reliably using both states of the condition:

```bash
# Block a CI/CD pipeline until the sandbox is fully operational and ready to take traffic
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready sandbox/my-env

# Wait until the sandbox has successfully suspended / hibernated
kubectl wait --for=condition=Suspended=True sandbox/my-env --timeout=60s

# Wait until the sandbox has successfully resumed and is no longer suspended
kubectl wait --for=condition=Suspended=False sandbox/my-env --timeout=60s

# Determine why a sandbox is not ready (e.g. DependenciesNotReady, SandboxSuspended)
kubectl get sandbox my-env -o custom-columns=READY_REASON:.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].reason

# View the status of the Suspended condition explicitly
kubectl get sandbox my-env -o custom-columns=SUSPENDED:.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Suspended")].status

# Check exactly when the sandbox was last resumed or suspended
kubectl get sandbox my-env -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Suspended")].lastTransitionTime}'
```

## Alternatives Considered

#### 1. Retaining the Legacy `status.phase` Field
One option considered was to continue using the single-string `status.phase` field (e.g., `Pending`, `Running`, `Suspended`).

* **Cons:**
    * **Inability to Represent Concurrent States:** A single string cannot represent multiple facets of the lifecycle simultaneously. For example, if we wanted to represent a Sandbox that is "Hibernated" but also "Updating Network", we would end up with a combinatorial explosion of compound phase strings.
    * **API Standards:** The Kubernetes API conventions explicitly deprecate the `Phase` pattern for new projects. Adhering to `Conditions` ensures compatibility with modern ecosystem tools like `kubectl wait`.
    * **Logic Complexity:** As the sandbox evolves, the state machine would require an exponential number of strings to represent every possible combination of infrastructure and application health.

#### 2. Utilizing a Single "Ready" Condition
We considered using only the `Ready` condition and overloading the `Reason` field to communicate the state of the infrastructure and the Pod.

* **Cons:**
    * **Lack of Granularity for Future Suspend States:** A single `Ready: False` status cannot granularly distinguish between different types of suspension. Future features like "freeze" (pausing container processes), "hibernate" (snapshotting memory to disk), or traditional "scale-to-zero" would all appear identically as "not ready". Extracting `Suspended` into its own explicitly tracked condition gives us the design space to represent these nuanced operational states in the future.
    * **Ambiguity in Suspension:** If only a `Ready` condition exists, setting it to `False` during suspension provides no programmatic signal that the network identity (Service) are still safely intact.
