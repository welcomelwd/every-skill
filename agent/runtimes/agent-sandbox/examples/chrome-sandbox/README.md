# Chrome in a Sandbox

## Overview

This example runs Chrome in an isolated environment.

Currently, it uses a Docker-based setup. However, it is intended to align with the **Sandbox CRD** model in `agent-sandbox`, where workloads run inside Kubernetes-managed Sandboxes.

This example is actively maintained and serves as the foundation for end-to-end (e2e) tests.

## Example Sandbox

Below is an example of running Chrome inside a Sandbox resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: agents.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Sandbox
metadata:
  name: chrome-sandbox
spec:
  podTemplate:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: chrome
          image: registry.k8s.io/chrome-sandbox
          ports:
            - containerPort: 9222
```

## How to Run

Apply the Sandbox:

```bash
kubectl apply -f chrome-sandbox.yaml
```
Port-forward to access Chrome debugging endpoint:

```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/chrome-sandbox 9222:9222
```

## Current Setup (Docker-based)

This example can be run locally using Docker for development and debugging purposes. It is already integrated with the `agent-sandbox` framework and used in end-to-end (e2e) tests via the Sandbox CRD.

Currently you can test it out by running `run-test`; it will build a (local) container image, then run it. The image will capture screenshots roughly every 100ms so you can observe the progress as Chrome launches and opens (currently) https://google.com

The screenshots are in an unusual xwg format, so the script depends on the `convert`
utility to convert those to an animated gif.

## Usage in e2e Tests

The Chrome sandbox is already used in the project’s end-to-end tests.

- The Sandbox manifest is defined in:
  `test/e2e/chromesandbox_test.go`
- The test creates a `Sandbox` resource running Chrome
- This ensures Chrome runs correctly inside a Sandbox environment

The container image used is available at:

```bash
docker pull registry.k8s.io/chrome-sandbox
```

## Using this example with Sandbox CRD

In a Sandbox-based setup:

- The Chrome container runs inside a `Sandbox` resource  
- The Sandbox controller manages lifecycle and isolation  
- Chrome can be accessed via a debugging endpoint (e.g., port `9222`)  
- Users interact with it using port-forwarding or services

## Mapping to Sandbox Concepts

| Current Setup        | Sandbox Equivalent              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Docker container     | Sandbox Pod                    |
| run-test script      | Sandbox lifecycle              |
| Local Chrome         | Chrome inside Sandbox          |
| Port exposure        | Kubernetes port-forward/service|

## Plans / Future Improvements

- Improve readiness and health checks for Chrome startup
- Add support for browser automation frameworks (e.g., Selenium, Playwright)
- Expand test coverage for more interactive/browser-based workloads
