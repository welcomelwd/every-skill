## Create a Sandbox with VSCode and Gemini CLI

Apply the sandbox manifest with PVC

```
kubectl apply -k base
```

They can then check the status of the applied resource.
Verify sandbox and pod are running:

```
kubectl get sandbox
kubectl get pod sandbox-example

kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready sandbox sandbox-example
```

### Harden Agent Sandbox isolation using gVisor (Optional)

The `Sandbox` API provides lifecycle features that are useful for managing long running
sandbox workloads on kubernetes. In real world scenarios, you may want to also
provide workload isolation for running untrusted workloads inside a sandbox.

[gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/docs/) provides a virtualization layer between
applications and the host operating system that creates a strong layer of
isolation. It implements the kernel in userspace and minimizes the risk of a
workload gaining access to the host machine.

This example demonstrates how to use `Sandbox` along with gVisor in order
to utilize the lifecycle features of `Sandbox` in addition with the workload
isolation features of gVisor.

#### Create a cluster with gVisor enabled

First, enable gVisor on your Kubernetes cluster. For examples of how to enable
gVisor, see the [gVisor documentation](https://gvisor.dev/docs/user_guide/quick_start/kubernetes/).

#### Create a Sandbox using the gVisor runtimeClassName

Apply the kustomize overlay to inject `runtimeClassName: gvisor` to the
`vscode-sandbox` example and apply it to the cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -k overlays/gvisor
```

Validate that the `Pod` with gVisor enabled is running:

```shell
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready sandbox sandbox-example
kubectl get pods -o jsonpath=$'{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}: {.spec.runtimeClassName}\n{end}'
```

### Harden Agent Sandbox isolation using Kata Containers and Microsoft Hypervisor (MSHV) (Optional)

Similarly to the gVisor scenario, there are scenarios where you may want to provide
workload isolation for running untrusted workloads inside a sandbox.

[AKS Sandbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-pod-sandboxing)
provides a hardware virtualization layer between the host operating system and the
containerized workload via [CloudHypervisor](https://www.cloudhypervisor.org) and
Microsoft Hypervisor (MSHV). There is no shared kernel between the host and the guest workload.

This example demonstrates how to use `Sandbox` along with CloudHypervisor in order
to utilize the lifecycle features of `Sandbox` alongside the hypervisor
isolation features of CloudHypervisor + MSHV.

#### Create a cluster with AKS Sandboxing enabled

The scripts directory contains shell scripts for provisioning, applying, and
cleaning up Azure Kubernetes cluster resources.

From the [./scripts](./scripts/) directory, execute the following.

```shell
./az-provision.sh
# either bake a new sandbox-router image or use the pre-baked ghcr.io/devigned/sandbox-router:latest
./apply.sh --sandbox-router-image ghcr.io/devigned/sandbox-router:latest
```

The `./apply.sh` script applies resources needed for ease of use, but at the heart
of it, it's simply the following:

```shell
kubectl apply -k ./overlays/kata-mshv
```

Which applies the overlay that includes the runtime class for Kata hypervisor
isolation (MSHV).

```yaml
runtimeClassName: kata-vm-isolation
```

#### Delete the AKS Kubernetes cluster and kubeconfig

Once you are done with your cluster, run the following command to deprovision
all of the resources and delete the local kubeconfig file.

```shell
./az-cleanup.sh
```

### Harden Agent Sandbox isolation using Kata Containers (Optional)

#### Prerequisites

* Host machine that supports nested virtualization

   You can verify that by running:

   ```sh
   cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
   ```
   In case of AMD platform replace `kvm_intel` with `kvm_amd`
   The output must be “Y” or 1.

* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Flinux%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

#### Create minikube cluster

> Note:
> At this moment, we use only `containerd` runtime, since it works without additional adjustments.

```sh
minikube start --vm-driver kvm2 --memory 8192  --container-runtime=containerd --bootstrapper=kubeadm
```

#### Install Kata Containers

Follow the instructions provided at [Kata Containers Installation Guide](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/tree/main/docs/install)

#### Create a Sandbox using the kata-qemu runtimeClassName

Apply the kustomize overlay to inject `runtimeClassName: kata-qemu` to the
`vscode-sandbox` example and apply it to the cluster:

```shell
kubectl apply -k overlays/kata
```

Validate that the `Pod` with Kata container enabled is running:

```shell
$ kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready sandbox sandbox-example
$ kubectl get pods -o jsonpath=$'{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}: {.spec.runtimeClassName}\n{end}'
```

## Accessing VSCode

### 1. Wait for VSCode to Start

The `sandbox-example` pod runs an initialization process (`envbuilder`) that clones the repository and installs dependencies before starting VSCode. You must wait for this process to finish.

Watch the logs until you see `HTTP server listening`:

```bash
# Wait for output similar to:
$ kubectl logs -f sandbox-example

[2025-...] info  Wrote default config file to /root/.config/code-server/config.yaml
[2025-...] info  HTTP server listening on [http://0.0.0.0:13337/](http://0.0.0.0:13337/)
[2025-...] info    - Authentication is disabled
```

### 2. Connect to VSCode

#### Option A: Simple Access (Standard Runtime)

If you are running the standard example (without gVisor or Kata), you can port-forward directly to the pod.

```bash
# Forward local port 13337 to the pod
kubectl port-forward pod/sandbox-example 13337:13337
```

Open your browser to: http://localhost:13337 or `<machine-dns>`:13337


#### Option B: Secure Access (gVisor / Kata / Production)

If you are using gVisor or Kata Containers, direct pod port-forwarding isn't compatible. In this case, use the Sandbox Router.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Deploy the Router (Required for All Modes):**
    ```bash
    # Deploys the Deployment and Service
    kubectl apply -f ../../clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/sandbox-router/sandbox_router.yaml
    ```

2.  **Deploy the Gateway (Production Only):**
    If you need external access via a Public IP (GKE), apply the Gateway configuration.
    ```bash
    # Deploys Gateway, HTTPRoute, and HealthCheckPolicy
    kubectl apply -f ../../clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/sandbox-router/gateway.yaml
    ```

**For Production (via Gateway)**

1. Get the Gateway IP:
```bash
export GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl get gateway external-http-gateway -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
echo "Gateway IP: $GATEWAY_IP"
```

2. **Connect: (Curl Test):** You must inject the routing headers. Use `curl` to test:
```bash
curl -v -H "X-Sandbox-ID: sandbox-example" \
        -H "X-Sandbox-Port: 13337" \
        http://$GATEWAY_IP
```

3.  **Access via Browser (UI):**
    To load the VSCode interface, your browser must send the routing headers.
    
    1.  Install a header-modifying extension (e.g., **ModHeader** for Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
    2.  Configure the extension to send:
        * `X-Sandbox-ID`: `sandbox-example`
        * `X-Sandbox-Port`: `13337`
    3.  Navigate to **`http://<GATEWAY_IP>`** (replace with the IP from step 1).

    You should see the VSCode interface load immediately.

**For Local Development (via Router Tunnel)**

For local development, port-forward to the **Router Service** (do not port-forward to the pod directly, as it's not compatible with secure runtimes like gVisor/kata).

1. Start the Tunnel: 
```bash 
# Forward local 8080 to the Router Service
kubectl port-forward svc/sandbox-router-svc 8080:8080 -n default
```

- **Access via Curl:** You need to send the correct headers to route traffic to your specific sandbox. Via curl, set:
```bash
curl -v -H "X-Sandbox-ID: sandbox-example" \
        -H "X-Sandbox-Port: 13337" \
        http://localhost:8080
```

#### Getting VSCode password

If the logs indicate authentication is enabled, retrieve the password.
In a separate terminal connect to the pod and get the password.

```
kubectl exec  sandbox-example --  cat /root/.config/code-server/config.yaml 
```

Use the password and connect to vscode.

## Use gemini-cli

Gemini cli is preinstalled. Open a teminal in vscode and use Gemini cli.
