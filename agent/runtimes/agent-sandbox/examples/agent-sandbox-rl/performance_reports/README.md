# Performance reports

Per-run performance reports for the `agent-sandbox-rl` package (the `RunReport`
produced by `SandboxFleet.run(...)`). Two emitters write here:

- **`examples/run_swebench_fleet.py`** (when `REPORT_DIR` is set) — a single run:
  ```text
  <strategy>_<n>tasks_<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.txt    # human-readable summary table
  <strategy>_<n>tasks_<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.json   # same data (report.to_dict())
  ```
- **`tests/loadtest.py`** — a parameterized multi-strategy load test writing a
  richer `<name>.md` (+ `.json`): parameters, **methodology**, cluster/nodes,
  warm-pool plan, a per-stage benchmark (incl. **claim latency = time-to-sandbox**),
  a **metric glossary**, and the full RunReport per strategy.

> **One redacted sample is checked in: [`sample_rl_rollout.md`](sample_rl_rollout.md)**
> (+ `.json`) — a `tests/loadtest.py` run in **RL instant-claim mode**
> (`warm_per_task` + `colocate_replicas`, 10 problems × 8 rollouts) with its
> `environment` block and image registry **scrubbed** (`<region>`, `PROJECT`, …). It
> only illustrates the format. **Don't commit real run reports** — they embed live
> cluster metadata and churn; everything except this sample + the READMEs is
> gitignored here.

### Reading a phase line

```
  wait_pool_ready       34.09s  (n=10, max=7.29s)
   └ phase             └ total   └ count └ slowest single occurrence
```

- **total** — sum of the wall time spent in that phase across **all** its
  occurrences in the run (seconds).
- **n** — how many times the phase ran (e.g. one `claim` per task, one
  `create_warmpool` per image pool, one `preflight` per run).
- **max** — the slowest single occurrence — useful for spotting tail latency
  (one slow image pull, one slow claim) that an average would hide.

> **Important — totals are summed, not wall-clock.** Under concurrency
> (`MAX_CONCURRENT`) and sliding windows, `claim`/`process` run in parallel and
> pools warm in overlapping waves, so the **sum of phase totals usually exceeds
> `TOTAL`** (the actual end-to-end wall time). Use per-phase totals to compare
> where time goes; use `TOTAL` for real elapsed time.

## Phases (lifecycle order)

| Phase | What it measures |
| :--- | :--- |
| `preflight` | Per-cluster checks: reachability, v1beta1 CRDs present, controller, namespace, and (if configured) runtime class / pull secret. |
| `plan` | Compute the run plan: map each unique image → a cluster (placement) and size its warm-pool replicas. Pure bookkeeping, usually ~0s. |
| `prepull` | *(only if enabled)* Wait for the DaemonSet that pre-pulls task images onto every node so warm pods skip the multi-GB pull. |
| `create_warmpool` | Create the `SandboxTemplate` + `SandboxWarmPool` objects for an image pool (the API calls only, not the pull). One per pool. |
| `wait_pool_ready` | Block until the pool reports `readyReplicas` (the pods are pulled, started, Ready). **Detected via a Kubernetes watch** — near-exact, no poll-grid rounding. This is the cold-start cost and is dominated by the image pull on a fresh node. |
| `prefetch` | *(`pipelined` strategy only)* Wall-time spent warming the **next** window's pools in the background while the current window's tasks run. Compare it to `process`: overlap is what `pipelined` buys (it wraps the same `create_warmpool`/`wait_pool_ready` work, recorded in the background). |
| `claim` | Acquire a sandbox for a task: create a `SandboxClaim`, resolve it to a `Sandbox`, wait Ready, build the handle. One per task. Sub-second when pools are warm. |
| `process` | Your `process_fn` running inside the sandbox (here the SWE-bench probe: a router-free `exec`). One per task. |
| `release` | Release a sandbox (delete its `SandboxClaim`; the controller reaps/replaces the pod). One per task. |
| `teardown` | Sweep everything the run created — claims → pools → templates — by the `app=agent-sandbox-rl` label. |

## Footer counters

```
  claims=10  tasks=10ok/0err  warm_replicas total=10 peak=5
```

| Field | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `claims` | Total `SandboxClaim`s created during the run (one per task here). |
| `tasks NNok/MMerr` | Tasks whose `process_fn` returned (`ok`) vs raised (`err`). A per-task failure is captured, not fatal. |
| `warm_replicas total` | Cumulative warm replicas created across the whole run (sums every pool ever warmed). |
| `warm_replicas peak` | Max warm replicas alive **at once** — the real idle footprint. This is where strategies differ: `naive` keeps every pool warm (peak ≈ total), `sliding` bounds it to the window (peak < total), `pipelined` bounds it to ≤ 2 windows (one running + one prefetching), `none` ≈ the window of size-1 pools. |

## Environment block

Best-effort cluster details collected by `SandboxFleet.describe_environment()`
at run start (omitted if the cluster can't be queried):

| Field | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `context` | Kubeconfig context the cluster used (`(ambient)` = current context). |
| `namespace` | Namespace the run's objects were created in. |
| `k8s_version` | API server git version. |
| `nodes` | Total nodes in the cluster (all pools, not just where pods landed). |
| `node_pools` | Distinct node-pool labels present (`cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool`). |
| `instance_types` | Distinct machine types (`node.kubernetes.io/instance-type`). |
| `region` | Cluster region (`topology.kubernetes.io/region`). |
