# agent-sandbox-rl

Generic, **multi-cluster** batch orchestration for running SWE-bench-style RL and
evaluation workloads on [Agent Sandbox](https://agent-sandbox.sigs.k8s.io/).

It builds on [`k8s-agent-sandbox`](../../clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client)
and turns the full run lifecycle into a small, framework-agnostic API:

> **load images → configure cluster(s) → compute replicas → preflight → warm
> pools → claim a sandbox per task (hostname/endpoint per sandbox) → run → tear
> down.**

It plugs into any RL stack (R2E-Gym, tunix, TorchRL, SkyRL): the integration
point is a `SandboxHandle` (stable hostname, endpoint, router-free `exec`). Sync
**and** async; low-level **primitives** *and* a managed **runner**; one cluster
or many. Targets the **v1beta1 ("beta")** Agent Sandbox API.

- Design: [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md)
- Architecture & lifecycle: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)
- RL-framework integration: [`examples/rl_integration.md`](examples/rl_integration.md)

## Why

`k8s-agent-sandbox` is single-sandbox / single-cluster and has no
SandboxTemplate/WarmPool CRUD, sizing, preflight, pre-pull, or batching — every
consumer re-implements those. `agent-sandbox-rl` provides them once, generically,
across clusters.

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Python ≥ 3.11** | The package targets 3.11+. |
| **A Kubernetes cluster** | With the **Agent Sandbox** controller + **v1beta1 extensions** installed (next step). GKE, kind, or any conformant cluster. |
| **`kubectl` + a kube context** | `agent-sandbox-rl` reads your kubeconfig; each `ClusterConfig` selects a context by name (`context=`), or uses the ambient one. |
| **`gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`** | GKE only — must be on `PATH` (`gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin`). |
| **Worker node capacity** | Pods land on the nodes your `TemplateSpec` selects (`node_selector`) and, if set, need a matching `runtime_class` (e.g. `gvisor`). |

### 2. Install the Agent Sandbox controller (cluster side)

`agent-sandbox-rl` orchestrates CRDs; it does not install them. The cluster must
already serve the **v1beta1** `SandboxTemplate` / `SandboxWarmPool` /
`SandboxClaim` / `Sandbox` resources. Apply the controller + extensions from a
[release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/releases), then verify:

```bash
kubectl get crd | grep agents.x-k8s.io        # expect the 4 CRDs
kubectl get pods -n agent-sandbox-system       # controller Running
```

`fleet.preflight()` checks all of this for you and raises `PreflightError` with a
precise message if something is missing.

### 3. Install the Python packages (client side)

Both the SDK and this package are installed editable from the repo. Run from the
**repo root**:

```bash
# core: SDK + this package
pip install -e clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client \
            -e examples/agent-sandbox-rl

# with the SWE-bench dataset loader (recommended for SWE-bench runs)
pip install -e clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client \
            -e 'examples/agent-sandbox-rl[swebench]'
```

### Dependencies & extras

Core deps (installed automatically): `k8s-agent-sandbox` (the SDK — **reused, not
forked**), `kubernetes`, and `pydantic>=2`. That's it — the always-on `RunReport`
is dependency-free, and merely importing the package registers no Prometheus
collectors (Prometheus is the optional `metrics` extra below).

| Extra | Pulls in | Use it for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `swebench` | `datasets` (Hugging Face) | `SweBenchSource` — loading SWE-bench task lists. |
| `async` | `k8s-agent-sandbox[async]`, `kubernetes_asyncio` | `AsyncSandboxFleet` on an asyncio loop. |
| `metrics` | `prometheus-client` | Export `asrl_*` Prometheus series (`enable_metrics=True`). Without it, `RunReport` still works. |
| `tracing` | `opentelemetry-api` / `-sdk` / `-exporter-otlp` (~=1.39) | OpenTelemetry span export (`enable_tracing=True`). No-op when absent. |
| `test` | `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `pytest-xdist` | Running the mocked unit tests. |

Combine extras with commas, e.g. `…/agent-sandbox-rl[swebench,async,metrics]`.

The **R2E-Gym adapter** (`adapters.r2egym`) needs R2E-Gym, which isn't on PyPI —
install it from its checkout (`pip install -e path/to/R2E-Gym`); the adapter
raises a clear error if it's missing. (No `r2egym` extra for that reason.)

### 4. Verify

```bash
# unit tests (mocked, no cluster needed)
pytest examples/agent-sandbox-rl

# import + reach your cluster
python -c "import agent_sandbox_rl as a; print('agent-sandbox-rl', a.__version__)"
python -c "from agent_sandbox_rl import SandboxFleet, FleetConfig, ClusterConfig; \
SandboxFleet(FleetConfig(clusters=[ClusterConfig(name='c', namespace='default')])).preflight()"
```

A clean `preflight()` (no `PreflightError`) means you're ready for the Quickstart.

## Quickstart

### Managed runner (simplest)

```python
from agent_sandbox_rl import SandboxFleet, FleetConfig, ClusterConfig, SweBenchSource, swebench_probe

fleet = SandboxFleet(FleetConfig(
    clusters=[ClusterConfig(name="rl", namespace="rl-tunix-swebench")],
    max_concurrent=8, max_warmpool_size=32, placement="image-affinity"))
fleet.load_tasks(SweBenchSource(limit=8))

# strategy: none | naive | sliding | pipelined   (concurrency defaults to max_concurrent)
results = fleet.run(swebench_probe, strategy="sliding", concurrency=8)
```

### Primitives (RL loop owns the schedule)

```python
fleet.load_tasks([{"id": "t1", "image": "busybox:1.36"}])
fleet.setup()                         # preflight → plan → warm pools
for task in fleet.tasks:
    h = fleet.acquire(task)           # claim a pre-warmed sandbox
    try:
        print(h.hostname, h.endpoint())
        print(h.exec(["sh", "-c", "echo hi $(hostname)"]))   # router-free
    finally:
        fleet.release(h)
fleet.teardown()
# or: `with fleet: ...`  (setup on enter, teardown on exit)
```

### Async

```python
from agent_sandbox_rl import AsyncSandboxFleet
fleet = AsyncSandboxFleet(cfg); fleet.load_tasks(src)
results = await fleet.run(async_or_sync_process_fn, strategy="naive", concurrency=64)
# or: async with fleet: h = await fleet.acquire(task); ...
```

### CLI example

```bash
cd examples
WARMPOOL_STRATEGY=sliding TASKS_LIMIT=4 MAX_CONCURRENT=4 NAMESPACE=rl-tunix-swebench \
NODE_SELECTOR_KEY=cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool NODE_SELECTOR_VAL=e2-pool \
python run_swebench_fleet.py
```

## Concepts

| Concept | What it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Task** | `id` + container `image` + opaque `metadata`. Generic unit of work. |
| **TaskSource** | Produces tasks: `ListSource`, `JsonlSource`, `SweBenchSource` (HF). |
| **FleetConfig** | Clusters + orchestration knobs (concurrency, sizing, placement, template). |
| **ClusterConfig** | One target cluster (context/kubeconfig, namespace, node selector, runtime class, pull secret, weight, capacity). |
| **SandboxFleet** / **AsyncSandboxFleet** | The orchestrator (sync / async). |
| **SandboxHandle** | A claimed sandbox: `hostname`, `pod_name`, `pod_ip`, `endpoint(port)`, `exec(cmd)`, `release()`. |
| **Placement** | Which cluster serves an image: `round-robin`, `least-loaded`, `capacity-weighted`, `image-affinity`. |
| **Strategy** | *When* pools exist: `none`, `naive`, `sliding`, `pipelined`. |
| **Recycling** | *Reuse* one sandbox across same-image tasks (reset between): `run(recycle=True)` — orthogonal to strategy — backed by `reuse_git_restore_sandbox` + `GitRestoreReset` (claims scale ÷ tasks-per-image). |
| **Adapters** | Framework glue: `adapters.swebench` (dataset → tasks), `adapters.r2egym` (`make_fleet_repo_env` binds a warm pod into R2E-Gym/tunix `RepoEnv`). |

## Warm-pool strategies

| Strategy | Behavior | Footprint | Best for |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `naive` | Pre-warm every image up front; process all (parallel); tear down. | Highest (all pools at once). | Small/medium image sets; RL (with `warm_per_task`). |
| `sliding` | Keep only a window of image pools warm, rolling forward. | Bounded (~`window`); window auto-sizes to `max_concurrent`. | Large image sets on limited disk. |
| `pipelined` | Like `sliding`, but **prefetch** window N+1's pools while window N's tasks run, so image pull overlaps execution. | Bounded (≤ 2 windows; the window is halved so peak ≈ `max_concurrent`). | **Pull-bound eval sweeps** (many distinct images, 1 task each). |
| `none` | One size-1 pool per image on demand, torn down after. | Lowest (cold-start per image). | Tiny runs / debugging. |

**How to choose — two questions: does the warm set fit on disk, and is pull the bottleneck?**

1. **Does the whole warm set fit on the node/pool's disk?** `naive` warms *every* pool
   at once, so all resident images must fit simultaneously. **If they fit**, `naive` is
   the simplest and reaches steady state fastest. **If they don't fit** (large image
   sets — the common case at hundreds+ of multi-GB images), you *must* bound what's
   resident at any moment → use **`sliding`** or **`pipelined`**, whose window
   auto-sizes to the disk budget (`avg_image_gb` / `node_ephemeral_gb` / `cluster_nodes`;
   see [Disk-aware window](#configuration-reference)). This is the primary reason to
   reach for a windowed strategy: **the images don't fit storage.**
2. **Is image pull the bottleneck?** For a **1:1 eval sweep** (hundreds of distinct
   images, one task each) pull dominates wall time → **`pipelined`** hides each window's
   pull behind the previous window's execution. So use `pipelined` when *either* the set
   doesn't fit disk *or* pull dominates (usually both, for eval).
3. **RL rollouts (1:G)** — each image is claimed by G rollouts, so pools are deep. Use
   **`naive`** or **`sliding`** with `warm_per_task` (+ `colocate_replicas`), **not
   `pipelined`**: deep per-image replicas shrink the pipelined window and serialize
   problems (measured wall 55 s → 97 s). See [Eval vs RL](#eval-vs-rl--recommended-recipes).

**In short:** `naive` when everything fits and you want simplicity; **`pipelined`/`sliding`
when the image set is too big for disk** (windowed = fits by construction), with
`pipelined` adding pull/exec overlap for pull-bound eval; `naive`/`sliding` + `warm_per_task`
for RL.
For repeated passes over the same dataset (RL epochs), use **`epochs=N`** to keep
pools resident between passes (re-pulls then hit the node layer cache — see
[Strategies & tuning](docs/strategies.md)), or **`keep_warm=True`** to drive your
own loop:

```python
# 3 epochs over all tasks, pools reused between them, torn down once at the end
results = fleet.run(process_fn, strategy="pipelined", epochs=3)   # -> list[list]

# or keep pools warm for your own training loop, then clean up explicitly
fleet.run(process_fn, strategy="naive", keep_warm=True)
# ... reuse warm pools across your own iterations ...
fleet.teardown()
```

## Replica sizing

Pool depth is the image's share of the concurrency budget, not its task count:

```text
replicas_image = clamp(round(MAX_CONCURRENT × tasks_image / tasks_total),
                       1, min(tasks_image, MAX_WARMPOOL_SIZE))
```

`MAX_CONCURRENT` is the one knob that both **sizes pools** and **parallelizes
claim+exec**. This is the core cost win — it avoids warming *N* pods for *N* tasks
while keeping sub-second claims. `python -m agent_sandbox_rl.sizing` prints the
old-vs-new footprints; for a skewed 100-task / 8-image batch (`MAX_WARMPOOL_SIZE=32`):

| `MAX_CONCURRENT` | baseline `min(count, cap)`, all warm | concurrency-aware footprint | sliding window |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 92 pods | **8 pods** | 1 |
| 8 | 92 pods | **11 pods** | 5 |
| 32 | 92 pods | **32 pods** | 8 |
| 256 | 92 pods | 92 pods | 8 |

The naive (warm-everything) baseline holds 92 pods regardless; sizing pools to the
concurrency budget cuts that to 8–32 for the same throughput, and `sliding` bounds
it further to a window.

### Instant-claim mode (RL)

The default sizing optimizes for *cost* (fewest warm pods for a given throughput).
For RL rollouts, **claim latency** (time-to-sandbox) often matters more — and RL
hits the *same* image repeatedly, so the 2nd concurrent rollout on an image
shouldn't queue behind the 1st. Two opt-in levers (both default off, so existing
behavior is unchanged):

```python
fleet = SandboxFleet(FleetConfig(
    clusters=[ClusterConfig(name="rl", namespace="rl")],
    max_concurrent=50, max_warmpool_size=16,
    warm_per_task=True,                          # 1 warm replica per task
    template=TemplateSpec(colocate_replicas=True)))  # pack a pool's replicas on one node
fleet.run(process_fn, strategy="naive")          # warm everything, full depth, packed
```

- **`warm_per_task`** sizes each pool to `min(tasks_image, max_warmpool_size)` —
  one ready replica per task — so every task claims immediately. Raise
  `max_warmpool_size` for images with more tasks than the cap (it warns and clamps
  otherwise).
- **`colocate_replicas`** adds a soft pod-affinity so a pool's replicas prefer the
  **same node**: only the first replica pulls the image, the rest start from the
  node's containerd layer cache (pairs with the default `image_pull_policy:
  IfNotPresent`). Soft, so it spills to other nodes instead of dead-locking when a
  node fills. Size the node for `replicas × cpu_request` (e.g. 50 × 250m ≈ 13 vCPU).
- **Deep/large warms stage automatically** — `warm_per_task` across many images can
  ask the controller to create tens of thousands of replicas at once. `start_warmpools`
  fills in **waves** of ≤ `warm_create_budget` (default 1000) creates, waiting for each
  wave to be Ready before the next. Set `warm_create_budget=0` to warm all at once.
  > **Version note:** staging bounds the controller's create burst on any version, but
  > on releases **≤ v0.5.3** it only *mitigates* (not prevents) the warm-pool
  > over-creation *churn* bug
  > ([#1215](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/issues/1215)) — there, also
  > set the controller flag **`--sandbox-warm-pool-concurrent-workers` low (≤10)**
  > (leave sandbox/claim workers high). On **v0.5.4+**
  > ([#1266](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/pull/1266))
  > the bug is fixed and `100` is a good default (see the controller-flags table below).
  > For deep warms on any version, **recycle** one sandbox per problem (see **Sandbox
  > recycling** below) remains the lower-footprint alternative to deep-warming.

> **When does this help?** Only when an image carries **more than one task**. A 1:1
> eval sweep (one image per task — see below) gets `min(1, …) = 1` replica, so
> `warm_per_task` is a **no-op** there. The payoff is **RL rollouts**, where the same
> problem image is claimed by *G* rollouts at once.
>
> It improves **claim latency (time-to-sandbox), not batch wall** — wall is bounded by
> `max_concurrent`, which the default sizing already saturates. The win is the *tail*:
> every rollout gets its own ready sandbox instead of queueing, which in a synchronous
> RL step (you wait for the slowest of *G* rollouts) directly cuts straggler delay.
> Measured (10 problems × 8 rollouts, 15 s each): `naive` claim tail 9 s → 6 s,
> wall ≈ flat.
>
> **Use `naive` or `sliding` with `warm_per_task` — not `pipelined`.** With deep
> per-image replicas the pipelined window shrinks to keep its footprint bounded, which
> serializes problems and underfills `max_concurrent` once rollouts do real work
> (measured: pipelined wall 55 s → 97 s). `pipelined` is for the 1:1 eval case.

### Sandbox recycling (reset-and-reuse) — experimental

`warm_per_task` gives each rollout its own *fresh* sandbox; **recycling** instead keeps
one claimed sandbox and *resets* it between rollouts on the same image, so **claims
scale with problems, not tasks** (÷ *G*). At the RL shape (G rollouts/problem) that is
G× fewer claims, controller reconciles, and API-server writes.

Turn it on with the **`recycle=True`** flag on `fleet.run(...)` — an *orthogonal
modifier*, not a strategy value: the chosen `strategy` still governs warming, `recycle`
only swaps the task→sandbox binding to reset-and-reuse. It's off by default (a no-op for
1:1 eval; it only helps multi-task-per-image shapes, and not every RL/eval scenario
resets cleanly).

```python
from agent_sandbox_rl import determinism_canary

# reuse one sandbox per image; reset between same-image tasks, quarantine if dirty.
# strategy warms the pools; run() manages setup / RunReport / teardown.
results = fleet.run(process_fn, strategy="naive", concurrency=40,
                    recycle=True, max_reuses=32, reset_timeout=5.0)
# async twin: await afleet.run(process_fn, strategy="naive", recycle=True, …)
# low-level (full control outside run()): reuse_git_restore_sandbox(fleet, tasks, fn, conc)
```

The reset (`GitRestoreReset`) restores `/testbed` to a pristine git tag, sweeps
processes + `/tmp`, then **verifies** the repo is back at the pristine SHA and clean;
any drift **quarantines** the sandbox (release + fresh claim) rather than risk
contaminating the next rollout — in RL a polluted sandbox silently biases rewards,
worse than a crash. By default the reset is **git-only** (fast); the expensive
site-packages (`pip freeze`) and git-config/hooks tripwires are opt-in
(`GitRestoreReset(check_env=True, check_config=True)`) since env drift is rare and
already bounded by `max_reuses` + the canary. The env-restore and overlay/checkpoint
tiers are deferred; drift there escalates to a fresh claim.

Two things make this scale (both on by default):
- **Persistent exec session** (`use_session=True`) — one held-open `bash` stream per
  sandbox, so task + reset pipe over a single websocket instead of one apiserver
  `exec` connect per command (exec cost O(sandboxes), not O(tasks)).
- **Safe on mixed image sets** — a non-git `/testbed` (no pristine anchor) can't be
  git-restored, so those images transparently fall back to a fresh claim per task; an
  `exec` failure mid-reset quarantines rather than aborting the batch.

Measured (barkland-brust, no-op, mc=100): at the RL shape (50 problems × 40 rollouts)
reuse **beat** fresh-claim on wall (416s vs 944s), claims (81 vs 1,987, 24.5×), and
success (100% vs 99.35%) — regular's shallow per-image warm pool saturates under
same-image contention. At eval shape (many distinct images, 1:1) keep fresh-claim +
`pipelined`; reuse only cuts claims there. See `plans/sandbox-recycling.md`.

> ⚠️ **Verify before trusting it for training.** Run the determinism canary first — the
> same seeded task twice in one recycled sandbox must produce byte-identical output:
> ```python
> out = determinism_canary(fleet, task, process_fn)
> assert out["identical"] and out["reset_clean"]
> ```
> Recycling is experimental; the design, hardening findings, and known limits are in
> `plans/sandbox-recycling.md` (notes repo).

### Eval vs RL — recommended recipes

The two workloads pull in opposite directions: **eval** is *pull-bound* (many distinct
images, one task each), **RL** is *claim-bound* per problem (one image, many rollouts).
(Eval uses `pipelined` because a large distinct-image set rarely fits disk *and* pull
dominates; if your eval set is small enough to fit resident, plain `naive` also works
and is simpler — see [How to choose](#warm-pool-strategies).)

| Job | Image : task | Strategy | Sizing levers | Why |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Eval** (SWE-bench sweep) | **1 : 1** | `pipelined` | default (concurrency-aware) + `epochs`/`keep_warm` + `IfNotPresent` + in-region mirror | Pull-bound. Overlap pulls and reuse the node cache. `warm_per_task` *and* `colocate_replicas` are both no-ops at 1 task/image (one replica → nothing to co-locate). |
| **RL rollouts** (GRPO / deepswe) | **1 : G** | `naive` or `sliding` | `warm_per_task=True` (+ `max_warmpool_size ≥ G`) + `colocate_replicas=True` | Every rollout claims instantly → lowest straggler tail. Avoid `pipelined` (window shrinks, serializes problems). |

```python
# Eval: 1:1 sweep, pull-bound — overlap pulls, reuse cache
fleet = SandboxFleet(FleetConfig(clusters=[...], max_concurrent=40))
fleet.run(eval_fn, strategy="pipelined", epochs=1)

# RL: G rollouts/problem — instant claims, no window shrinkage
fleet = SandboxFleet(FleetConfig(
    clusters=[...], max_concurrent=40, max_warmpool_size=8,   # >= rollouts/problem
    warm_per_task=True, template=TemplateSpec(colocate_replicas=True)))
fleet.run(rollout_fn, strategy="naive", keep_warm=True)       # reuse across steps
```

The [load test](tests/loadtest.py) reproduces both: `--tasks-per-image 1` (eval) vs
`--tasks-per-image G --warm-per-task --colocate` (RL). Add `reuse` to `--strategies`
(e.g. `--strategies naive,pipelined,reuse`) to compare recycling against the warm-pool
strategies in the same run (`--max-reuses`/`--reset-timeout`/`--check-env` tune it).

## Multi-cluster

Pass several `ClusterConfig`s (different `context`/`kubeconfig`) + a `placement`;
the fleet builds a per-context client for each, distributes pools/claims, and each
`SandboxHandle` carries its owning cluster. Cross-cluster reachability is the
caller's concern (see the integration guide).

### Multiple clusters and multiple node pools

Each `ClusterConfig` targets one placement domain via its `node_selector`, so plan
a deployment as **one `ClusterConfig` per (cluster × node pool)** and let a
`placement` strategy spread work across them. For pools *within the same cluster*,
give each config the same `context` but a distinct `node_selector` — **and a
distinct `namespace`**: SandboxTemplate/WarmPool names are keyed by image only
(`r2e-img-<hash>`), so two same-namespace configs warming the same image would
collide; separate namespaces keep them isolated. Prefer `capacity-weighted` or
`least-loaded` placement when pools are heterogeneous (e.g. a 110-pod e2 pool
alongside a 256-pod n2 pool) so the larger pool gets a proportional share, and set
each config's capacity/weight accordingly. (To instead let the scheduler place
across pools freely, use a single config with no `node_selector` and a node
affinity in `TemplateSpec.extra_pod_spec` — simpler, but you lose control of the
split across pools with different pod caps.)

## Configuration reference

**FleetConfig:** `clusters`, `placement`, `max_concurrent` (1), `max_warmpool_size`
(8), `warm_per_task` (False — one warm replica per task for instant claims),
`window_size` (None=auto), `ready_timeout` (900), `warm_create_budget` (1000 — stage
the warm fill in waves of ≤ N sandbox creates in flight to bound the controller's
create burst; on controllers ≤ v0.5.3 also pair with a low
`--sandbox-warm-pool-concurrent-workers` to dodge #1215; `0` = warm all at once), `template`
(`TemplateSpec`), `template_name_prefix` (`r2e-img-`), `labels`. Disk-aware sizing (optional):
`avg_image_gb`, `node_ephemeral_gb`, `disk_headroom` (0.25), `cluster_nodes`
(None) — when set, the auto window for `sliding`/`pipelined` is capped so resident
images fit disk; `cluster_nodes` makes that the *whole pool's* disk (distinct images
spread across nodes) instead of a single node's (None = conservative single-node
bound; the capacity planner sets it from the probed node count).

**Runaway safeguards** (see `plans/sdk-runaway-safeguards.md`): `overcommit_factor`
(1.5) + `max_live_sandboxes` (None) — the **circuit breaker**: if live sandboxes this
run owns exceed `min(expected × factor, max_live_sandboxes)`, the fleet tears down and
raises `FleetOvercommitError` (catches accidental over-creation; `factor=0` disables);
`breaker_poll_s` (5.0). `install_teardown_hooks` (True) installs atexit/SIGINT/SIGTERM
teardown on graceful exits (normal return, exceptions, `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`) — these are
**best-effort** and can't catch `SIGKILL` / OOM / node loss. For those abrupt cases,
every resource is labelled with `fleet.run_id`, and **`reap(run_id=…)`** / `python -m
agent_sandbox_rl.reaper` is the recovery path — sweeping an orphaned run by label. `plan()` also emits **advisory** `plan.warnings` (never fatal)
for footprint/concurrency beyond what the control plane comfortably absorbs.

**ClusterConfig:** `name`, `kubeconfig`, `context`, `in_cluster`, `namespace`,
`node_selector`, `runtime_class`, `image_pull_secret`, `weight`, `max_replicas`.

**TemplateSpec:** `resources` (cpu/memory), `keepalive_command` (`sleep infinity`),
`runtime_class`, `node_selector`, `image_pull_secret`, `image_pull_policy`
(`IfNotPresent` — reuses the node layer cache across epochs), `colocate_replicas`
(False — prefer scheduling a pool's replicas on one node for cache reuse),
`extra_pod_spec`.

**Image rewriting (optional):** redirect task images at an in-region mirror /
pull-through cache without touching the source:

```python
from agent_sandbox_rl import make_rewriter
fleet.load_tasks(source, image_rewrite=make_rewriter(
    registry="us-docker.pkg.dev", project="my-proj", repo="swebench-mirror"))
# docker.io/... -> us-docker.pkg.dev/my-proj/swebench-mirror/...
# (original preserved in metadata['original_image'])
```

## Operational features

- **Preflight** (`fleet.preflight()`): per-cluster reachability, v1beta1 CRD
  versions, controller, namespace, and (if configured) runtime class + pull
  secret. Hard failures raise `PreflightError`; soft issues are warnings.
- **Pre-pull** (`fleet.prepull()` / `setup(prepull=True)`): a DaemonSet caches
  task images on every node so warm pools skip the multi-GB pull. This is where
  cold-start time goes — `wait_pool_ready` dominates a cold run (the sample report
  shows it as ~34 s of a 48 s run), so pre-pulling (or a persistent node-level
  image cache) is the single biggest lever for repeated/RL runs. See
  [docs/strategies.md §4](docs/strategies.md#4-caching--amortization-levers-avoid-the-pull).
- **Watch-based readiness**: `wait_for_pool_ready` watches the WarmPool and
  returns at the `readyReplicas` event (near-exact timing, no fixed poll grid),
  reconnecting and falling back to a short re-check on watch drops.
- **Cleanup**: everything created is labeled `app=agent-sandbox-rl`; `teardown`
  sweeps claims → pools → templates (defensive against stray claims).

## Observability

Three layers, mirroring the `k8s-agent-sandbox` SDK so traces/metrics interoperate:

1. **`RunReport`** — always-on, dependency-free. `fleet.run(...)` records per-phase
   timings (preflight, plan, create_warmpool, wait_pool_ready, claim, process,
   release, teardown), claims, tasks ok/err, warm-replica total+peak, and an
   `environment` block (cluster context/namespace/k8s-version/nodes/node-pools/
   instance-types/region, via `fleet.describe_environment()`).

   ```python
   results = fleet.run(probe, strategy="naive")
   print(fleet.report.summary())     # benchmark table (also logged at INFO)
   data = fleet.report.to_dict()     # JSON-friendly
   ```
   ```text
   ── Run report (strategy=naive) ──
     environment:
       default: context=(ambient)  namespace=rl-tunix-swebench  k8s_version=v1.35...
                nodes=11  node_pools=[e2-pool,...]  region=us-central2
     preflight              1.35s  (n=1, max=1.35s)
     wait_pool_ready        8.44s  (n=2, max=4.22s)
     claim                  5.66s  (n=4, max=1.69s)
     process                1.56s  (n=4, max=0.40s)
     ...
     TOTAL                 14.71s
     claims=4  tasks=4ok/0err  warm_replicas total=3 peak=3
   ```

   `examples/run_swebench_fleet.py` writes a timestamped `.txt` + `.json` report
   to `REPORT_DIR` when that env var is set. See
   [`performance_reports/README.md`](performance_reports/README.md) for a full
   breakdown of every phase and metric. (Note: per-phase totals are *summed*
   durations, so under concurrency they exceed the wall-clock `TOTAL`.)

2. **Prometheus metrics** (opt-in, default **on**; needs the `metrics` extra) —
   `asrl_*` series on the default registry. The collectors are registered lazily
   on the first metrics-enabled run, so importing the package has no global side
   effect (and with `prometheus-client` not installed, metrics are a silent
   no-op while `RunReport` keeps working). Series:
   `asrl_phase_latency_seconds`, `asrl_task_latency_seconds`,
   `asrl_run_latency_seconds` (histograms), `asrl_claims_total`,
   `asrl_tasks_total` (counters), `asrl_warm_replicas` (gauge). Labels are
   bounded: `phase · cluster · family · strategy · status` (`family` is the
   repo family, not the per-image tag). Expose them with the built-in helper:

   ```python
   from agent_sandbox_rl import serve_metrics
   server, _ = serve_metrics(port=9095)   # GET /metrics ; caller owns lifetime
   ```

3. **OpenTelemetry spans** (opt-in, default off; needs the `tracing` extra) —
   reuse the SDK's tracer/provider so fleet `asrl.*` spans nest with the SDK's
   `create_claim`/`wait_for_sandbox_ready` spans in one trace.

   ```python
   FleetConfig(..., observability=ObservabilityConfig(
       enable_metrics=True, enable_tracing=True))
   ```

   (`asyncio.to_thread` doesn't auto-propagate OTel context — under
   `AsyncSandboxFleet`, metrics + `RunReport` are exact; nested SDK spans are a
   documented follow-up.)

## Performance tuning

**[docs/strategies.md](docs/strategies.md)** is the consolidated reference — every
strategy, sizing mode, and caching/infra lever, with the workload each fits and the
exact flag. It opens with a [decision table](docs/strategies.md#1-pick-your-config-decision-table)
(workload → strategy → flags) and an
[all-levers-at-a-glance](docs/strategies.md#all-levers-at-a-glance) table.

For **eval** (1:1 sweeps), wall-clock is dominated by **image pull**, not task work.
The levers — `pipelined` (overlap pull with execution), `epochs`/`keep_warm` +
`IfNotPresent` (amortize pulls across passes via the node layer cache), **pre-pull**
(`fleet.prepull()` — a DaemonSet that caches images on every node before the hot
path), an in-region Artifact Registry mirror (the `image_rewrite` hook), GKE Image
Streaming, and disk-aware window sizing — are all detailed there.

For **RL** (G rollouts per problem), the lever is instant claims —
[`warm_per_task` + `colocate_replicas`](#eval-vs-rl--recommended-recipes) with
`naive`/`sliding`, which minimize the per-rollout claim tail (the synchronous
straggler) rather than batch wall.

### Capacity-aware planning (full batches)

The planner reads a node pool's CPU + ephemeral storage + pod density and computes the
**optimal preload plan** for running all *N* tasks — strategy, `max_concurrent`, and
per-image replicas/window — so every image is pulled + *uncompressed* and the sandboxes
are warm **before** the task phase. It picks `naive` (warm everything) when the whole set
fits the pool's disk/CPU/pods, else a disk-bounded `pipelined` window, and reports the
binding bottleneck (cpu / disk / pods). For RL shapes (`tasks_per_image > 1`) it enables
`warm_per_task` + `colocate_replicas`. Three ways to use it:

**1. Importable API** (`agent_sandbox_rl.capacity`):

```python
from agent_sandbox_rl import (Cluster, ClusterConfig, probe_capacity,
                              plan_benchmark, render_plan)
core = Cluster(ClusterConfig(context="my-ctx")).core_api
cap  = probe_capacity(core, "cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool=my-pool")
plan = plan_benchmark(cap, n_images=500, tasks_per_image=1, avg_image_gb=10)
print(render_plan(cap, plan))      # capacity + recommended strategy/concurrency/replicas
# -> plan.strategy, plan.max_concurrent, plan.replicas_per_image, plan.bottleneck ...
```

**2. Interactive wizard** — consults you (cluster, node pool, batch shape), prints the
plan, and offers to run it. Plan-only/read-only by default:

```bash
python examples/plan_capacity.py            # prompts; or pass flags + --non-interactive
```

**3. Benchmark CLI** — plan + optional timed run (preload vs task), writes a report:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/run_full_swebench_benchmark.py \
  --context <ctx> --namespace <ns> \
  --node-selector cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool=<pool> \
  --n-images 500 --avg-image-gb 10            # add --execute to actually run
```

## Setting your controller to high scale

The fleet can fan out hundreds–thousands of concurrent claims, but throughput is
ultimately bounded by the **Agent Sandbox controller's** reconcile concurrency, not
this package. The controller ships with conservative defaults: the **Sandbox**
controller reconciles at **1 worker** and **SandboxClaim** at **50** — so a
1000-wide `max_concurrent` run still has its sandbox state transitions serialized
one at a time. For large eval/RL batches, raise the controller's worker flags (on
the controller Deployment's container args, namespace `agent-sandbox-system`):

| flag | default | recommended (high scale) | why |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `--kube-api-qps` | `-1` | **`-1`** (leave) | `-1` disables client-side rate limiting entirely — already optimal. |
| `--kube-api-burst` | `10` | n/a | **Moot while `qps=-1`** (burst is only consulted when QPS > 0). Only raise if you set a positive QPS. |
| `--sandbox-concurrent-workers` | `100` | **`1000`** | Sandbox reconciles (claim binding → Ready) are the main serializer; match your peak concurrent sandboxes. |
| `--sandbox-claim-concurrent-workers` | `50` | **`1000`** | Concurrent `SandboxClaim` reconciles; match peak in-flight claims. |
| `--sandbox-warm-pool-concurrent-workers` | `1` | **`100`** (v0.5.4+) | On **v0.5.4+** the over-creation *churn* bug ([#1215](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/issues/1215), fixed by [#1266](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/pull/1266): expectations-gated creates, terminating-aware counting) is gone — parallel warm-pool reconciles are safe. **`100`** is a good default (fast replenishment, bounded apiserver burst); raise toward your warm width if the warm-fill wall matters (validated clean at `500` with 500 pools). **On ≤ v0.5.3 keep it low (≤10; `1` fully serializes)** — there high values race a stale informer cache and over-create → delete → re-create sandboxes (observed ~17K pods for an 8K target). |
| `--sandbox-template-concurrent-workers` | `1` | **`1000`** | Parallel template reconciles. |
| `--sandbox-warm-pool-max-batch-size` | `300` | **`1000`** | Parallel pod create/delete *within* one warm-pool reconcile. |

**Key point:** `--kube-api-qps`/`--kube-api-burst` are *not* the lever — the
controller's API client is already uncapped at `qps=-1`. The **worker concurrency**
flags are what unblock high-scale claims. Size them to your `max_concurrent`. Also
size this package's client pool (`build_api_client` defaults the urllib3
`connection_pool_maxsize` to 1000) to match — otherwise the driver throttles before
the controller does. **Version note:** `--sandbox-warm-pool-concurrent-workers` is
release-gated (see the row above) — `100` on v0.5.4+ (#1266 fixed the #1215 churn;
validated up to 500), but **≤10 on ≤ v0.5.3**. The staged warm fill
(`FleetConfig.warm_create_budget`, default 1000) remains useful on any version to
bound the create burst of very large/deep warms.

Example patch (**v0.5.4+ values** — on controllers ≤ v0.5.3 use
`--sandbox-warm-pool-concurrent-workers=10` instead, per the table above):

```bash
kubectl -n agent-sandbox-system patch deploy agent-sandbox-controller --type=json -p '[
  {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--sandbox-concurrent-workers=1000"},
  {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--sandbox-claim-concurrent-workers=1000"},
  {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--sandbox-warm-pool-concurrent-workers=100"},
  {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--sandbox-template-concurrent-workers=1000"},
  {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--sandbox-warm-pool-max-batch-size=1000"}
]'
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| `PreflightError: ... crd:* not found` | Agent Sandbox extensions not installed — apply the controller + extensions. |
| Claims never resolve / pods `Pending` | Node selector unsatisfiable, or `runtimeClassName` (e.g. gvisor) with no matching nodes. |
| Docker Hub `429` on image pulls | Set `image_pull_secret`, or mirror images to a registry / use pre-pull. |
| `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'` on parallel exec | Handled: `SandboxHandle.exec` builds a fresh `ApiClient` per call (kubernetes `stream()` isn't thread-safe across a shared client). |
| Async `process_fn` calls `handle.exec` | `exec` is blocking — in async code do `await asyncio.to_thread(h.exec, ...)`, or pass a sync `process_fn` (run in a worker thread automatically). |

## Testing

```bash
pytest examples/agent-sandbox-rl   # mocked, no cluster
```

This suite is also wired into the repo's unit-test runner
(`dev/tools/test-unit`, run by `make test-unit` and the `unit-test` presubmit),
so regressions are caught in CI — it spins up a venv, installs the in-repo SDK +
this package's `[test]` extra, and runs the mocked tests.

## Status

Phases 1–8 implemented and live-verified on GKE (agent-sandbox `v0.5.0rc1`):
config/sizing, multi-cluster, template/warm-pool CRUD, sources/placement/handles,
fleet primitives, strategies + parallel execution, preflight, pre-pull, async,
the SWE-bench adapter + example, and observability (RunReport + Prometheus +
OpenTelemetry). See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md)
and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
