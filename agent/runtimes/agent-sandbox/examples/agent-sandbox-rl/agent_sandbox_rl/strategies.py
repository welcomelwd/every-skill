"""Warm-pool provisioning strategies + bounded-parallel task execution.

Each strategy decides *when* image pools exist; all of them process the actual
claim+exec in parallel (up to ``concurrency`` threads — claiming and exec are
blocking IO, so threads parallelize them well). The async variant in a later
phase does the same with asyncio.
