"""Sandbox recycling — reset-and-reuse a claimed sandbox across same-image tasks.

For G rollouts on one image, claiming→deleting→re-claiming per rollout makes claims
scale with *tasks*; recycling makes them scale with *problems* (÷G). The crux is the
**pollution problem**: a reused sandbox must look byte-identical to a fresh one, or it
silently biases RL rewards. See `plans/sandbox-recycling.md` for the full design and
the v2 deep-research findings this implements.

This module ships the **git-restore** reset tier (the cheapest safe mechanism):
restore the `/testbed` working tree to a pristine tag, sweep processes + `/tmp`, then
**verify** cleanliness — repo clean at the pristine SHA, and (tripwires, not fixes) the
Python env, git config, and hooks unchanged. Drift in a surface we don't actively
restore → the reset returns False → the executor **quarantines** the sandbox (releases
it and claims a fresh one). It deliberately does NOT restore the conda/site-packages
env or overlay-restart (the costlier tiers): those are detected and escalated to a
fresh claim instead. `determinism_canary` is the ground-truth check that a reset
actually produced identical outputs.

  Tasks are grouped by image; each group runs sequentially inside a single claimed
  sandbox, git-restore-reset between rollouts. Groups run in parallel up to
  ``concurrency`` (= the concurrent-sandbox budget). ``max_reuses`` bounds how many
  tasks one sandbox serves before a **rotation** (release + fresh claim) to cap drift.
  A reset that fails cleanliness verification or exceeds ``reset_timeout`` triggers a
  **quarantine** (also release + fresh claim). ``reset_timeout`` is advisory — it flags
  a *slow* reset after the fact; it does not interrupt a *hung* ``exec`` (that blocks
  the group's worker thread). Returns one result per task in ``tasks`` order (a per-task
  exception is captured, not raised) — matching ``strategies.process_parallel``.

  Records ``reset`` / ``quarantine`` / ``rotate`` phases in the RunReport so the
  claim-economics win is measurable next to the baseline strategies.

  **Non-git images are handled transparently:** if an image has no git repo at
  ``/testbed`` (no pristine anchor at prime), it can't be git-restored, so that
  image's tasks fall back to a **fresh claim per task** (no reset attempts, no
  quarantine churn) — safe to point this at a mixed image set. A reset whose
  ``exec`` fails (dead pod / no bash) is reported dirty and quarantined, never
  raised into the batch.

  **``scale_on_hold`` (default True):** once a recyclable sandbox is claimed and
  held for its whole group, its warm pool is dropped (`unwarm_image`) so the
  controller does not **replenish** a replacement the reuse never claims. This
  removes the *sustained* idle-warm footprint (steady state ~1× the held count
  instead of ~2×) and the ongoing claim-driven replenishment that feeds the
  warm-pool over-creation bug (#1215). Note the *peak* during the initial
  concurrent-claim burst can still transiently reach ~2× (each claim briefly
  replenishes before its `unwarm` lands); stage the claims to cut that too. A
  quarantine/rotation re-claim JIT re-warms the pool first. Verified safe: a
  claimed sandbox survives its pool being scaled/deleted (a `SandboxClaim`
  detaches it from warm-pool ownership). Non-recyclable (fresh-claim-per-task)
  images keep their pools. Set False to keep pools resident (old behavior).

  more concurrent sandboxes than OS threads allow (blocking git/exec/claim calls are

  a small image set. Requires the image's warm pool to have K replicas (warm with
  ``warm_per_task`` + ``max_warmpool_size=K``). With ``scale_on_hold``, the pool is
  ref-counted to ``desired = active_shards − held`` so ``held + warm == active`` per
  image throughout: K claims never trigger the replenishment storm, and no dangling
