"""`AsyncSandboxFleet` — an awaitable, event-loop-native fleet.

Same surface as `SandboxFleet`, for RL frameworks (TorchRL/SkyRL/etc.) that own
an asyncio loop. It reuses the tested sync core, running each blocking k8s call on
a **dedicated thread pool sized to ``max_concurrent``** (see `_thread_pool` — *not*
``asyncio.to_thread``'s shared default pool, which is tied to the CPU count and
would starve/deadlock the `pipelined` strategy's overlapping warm/unwarm) and
driving real concurrency via ``asyncio.gather`` + a `Semaphore`. ``process_fn`` may
be sync or async.

(Design note: this is a thread-backed asyncio wrapper rather than a native
``kubernetes_asyncio`` rewrite — it delivers the same awaitable API + concurrency
with far less risk, reusing the cluster/resources/strategies logic verbatim. A
native async I/O backend can replace the internals later without changing this
API.)
