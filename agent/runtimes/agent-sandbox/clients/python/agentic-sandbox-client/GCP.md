## Tracing with Open Telemetry and Google Cloud Trace

This guide explains how to run the `SandboxClient` with `OpenTelemetry` tracing enabled to send
traces to `Google Cloud Trace`.

This guide uses Google Cloud Trace as the observability backend. However,
because OpenTelemetry is an open-source, vendor-neutral standard, this setup can be adapted to work
with any backend that supports OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol).

### Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with the Cloud Trace, Cloud Monitoring and Logging, and Telemetry APIs enabled.
- The user or service account must have the `roles/logging.logWriter`,
  `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`, and `roles/cloudtrace.agent` permissions.
- Ensure you have `docker`, `kubectl`, and the `gcloud CLI` installed and configured.
- Follow all of the prerequisites and steps in the README to create a
  cluster, install the controller, deploy the router, create a sandboxwarmpool, and create a virtual
  environment with the agent-sandbox-client and the tracing dependencies installed into the .venv.

### Local Development

#### 1. Authenticate with Google Cloud

For local development, log in with Application Default Credentials. The `OpenTelemetry` collector
will use the credentials to export the traces to Google Cloud Trace.

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### 2. Configure the Collector

Save a copy of the file named `otel-collector-config.yaml.example` in this directory as
`otel-collector-config.yaml` in your current working directory. Replace `YOUR-GCP-PROJECT-ID` in the
file with your actual Google Cloud project ID.

#### 3. Run the Collector

From the directory containing your `otel-collector-config.yaml` config file, run the following
command to start the collector in Docker.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name otel-collector \
  -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v $(pwd)/otel-collector-config.yaml:/etc/otelcol/config.yaml \
  -v $HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json:/gcp/credentials.json \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/gcp/credentials.json \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib \
  --config /etc/otelcol/config.yaml
```

Run `docker ps` to check that the `otel-collector` is running. If you do not see it, run
`docker logs otel-collector` to see the error message.

#### 4. Run the Sandbox Client with Tracing

To run the client and generate traces, instantiate the SandboxClient with the `enable_tracing=True`
flag in your Python script.

```python
from k8s_agent_sandbox import SandboxClient

def main():
    # ...
    sb = SandboxClient(tracer_config=SandboxTracerConfig(enable_tracing=True))
    sandbox = sb.create_sandbox(warmpool="python-sandbox-warmpool")
    try:
        sandbox.commands.run("echo 'Hello, World!'")
    finally:
        sandbox.terminate()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Alternatively, you can also run the `test_client.py` in this directory with:

```bash
python test_client.py --enable-tracing
```

#### 5. View the Traces

After running your client script, traces will be sent to Google Cloud.

- Wait a minute or two for the data to be processed.
- Go to the Google Cloud Trace Explorer.
- You will see your traces appear in the list. You can click on a trace to see the full waterfall
  diagram, including the sandbox-client.lifecycle parent span and all its children.

### GKE Deployment

For production or testing in a real GKE cluster, you should deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector
inside the cluster. This allows both the client (if running in the cluster) and the controllers
to send traces to the same collector.

Please refer to the official Google Cloud documentation for instructions on how to deploy the
Google-Built OpenTelemetry Collector on GKE:
[Deploy Google-Built OpenTelemetry Collector on GKE](https://docs.cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/instrumentation/opentelemetry-collector-gke).

When running in GKE, you will need to configure your client to send traces to the cluster-internal
address of the collector service. You can do this by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`
environment variable:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://otel-collector.default.svc.cluster.local:4317"
```

Replace `otel-collector.default.svc.cluster.local` with the actual service name and namespace
of your deployed collector.

## Tracing Behavior with Multiple Clients

It is generally expected that most clients within the same application process will share the same
`trace_service_name`. The default for the `SandboxClient` is `sandbox-client`.

The `SandboxClient` relies on a **process-wide singleton** `TracerProvider`. This means:

1.  **Creation**: The provider is created only **once**, upon the first initialization of a
    `SandboxClient` with tracing enabled.
2.  **Persistence**: It persists for the entire lifetime of the Python process and is shared by all
    subsequent clients.
3.  **Shutdown**: It is strictly shut down only when the process exits (via `atexit`).

Because the provider is global, the `service.name` resource attribute is **immutable** after the
first initialization. When multiple clients with different service names are used in the same
process, the **first client wins** the global service name configuration. However, each client
maintains its own **instrumentation scope**, ensuring traces remain distinguishable.

| Feature                   | Client A (Initialized First)   | Client B (Initialized Second)                     |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **trace_service_name**    | `sandbox-client-a`             | `sandbox-client-b`                                |
| **Global `service.name`** | `sandbox-client-a` (Wins)      | `sandbox-client-a` (Ignored w/ Warning)           |
| **Instrumentation Scope** | `sandbox_client_a`             | `sandbox_client_b`                                |
| **Span Name Format**      | `sandbox-client-a.<operation>` | `sandbox-client-b.<operation>`                    |
| **Trace Backend View**    | Service: `sandbox-client-a`    | Service: `sandbox-client-a` (but separate scopes) |
