# Agentic Sandbox Pod Snapshot Extension

This directory contains the Python client extension for interacting with the Agentic Sandbox to manage Pod Snapshots. This extension allows you to trigger snapshots of a running sandbox, suspend it, and resume it from the suspended state.

## Components

The snapshot functionality is driven by two main components:

### `PodSnapshotSandboxClient`

The main entry point for the snapshot extension. It inherits from the base `SandboxClient` but automatically validates that the required GKE Pod Snapshot CRDs are installed on the cluster upon initialization. It ensures that all sandboxes created via this client are instantiated as `SandboxWithSnapshotSupport`.

### `SandboxWithSnapshotSupport`

This class wraps the base `Sandbox` to seamlessly provide snapshot capabilities. It manages the sandbox lifecycle while granting access to the underlying snapshot operations via the `.snapshots` property.

- **Suspend**: Terminates the Pod. It can optionally take a snapshot immediately before suspending (enabled by default).
- **Resume**: Recreates the pod, automatically restoring its state from the most recent available snapshot.
- **Is Suspended**: Checks if the sandbox is currently suspended (i.e., spec.operatingMode is set to `Suspended`).

> **Note**: A sandbox can only be restored from its own previous snapshots (via the Suspend/Resume lifecycle). A new or different sandbox cannot be restored from the snapshot of another sandbox.

### `SnapshotEngine`

The core engine responsible for interacting with the GKE Pod Snapshot Controller.

- **Create**: Creates `PodSnapshotManualTrigger` custom resources and waits for the snapshot to be completed.
- **List**: Lists existing snapshots for a sandbox, with optional filtering by creation timestamp range (`created_after`/`created_before`) and a flag to return ready-only snapshots.
- **Delete**: Deletes a specific snapshot by UID.
- **Delete All**: Deletes all snapshots for the pod, with optional filtering by creation timestamp range (`created_after`/`created_before`).
- **Cleanup**: Ensures that manual trigger resources are cleanly deleted when the sandbox context exits.

## Usage Example

Here is an example demonstrating how to initialize the client and trigger a snapshot:

```python
from k8s_agent_sandbox.gke_extensions.snapshots import PodSnapshotSandboxClient

# Initialize the specialized snapshot client
client = PodSnapshotSandboxClient()

# Create a sandbox with snapshot capabilities enabled
sandbox = client.create_sandbox(
    warmpool="python-counter-pool",
    namespace="default"
)

try:
    # Trigger a manual snapshot via the snapshots engine
    response = sandbox.snapshots.create("my-first-snapshot")

    if response.success:
        print(f"Snapshot created successfully! UID: {response.snapshot_uid}")
    else:
        print(f"Snapshot failed: {response.error_reason}")

    # Suspend the sandbox (automatically takes a snapshot and sets operatingMode to Suspended)
    print("Suspending sandbox...")
    suspend_response = sandbox.suspend(snapshot_before_suspend=True)
    if suspend_response.success:
        print("Sandbox suspended successfully.")
    # Resume the sandbox (sets operatingMode to Running and restores from the latest snapshot)
    print("Resuming sandbox...")
    resume_response = sandbox.resume()
    if resume_response.success:
        print(f"Sandbox resumed! Restored from snapshot: {resume_response.snapshot_uid}")

    # Suspend the sandbox before performing a dedicated restore
    print("Suspending sandbox...")
    suspend_response = sandbox.suspend(snapshot_before_suspend=False)
    if suspend_response.success:
        print("Sandbox suspended successfully.")

    # Restore the sandbox to a specific previous snapshot
    print("Restoring sandbox to a specific snapshot...")
    restore_response = sandbox.restore(snapshot_uid=response.snapshot_uid)
    if restore_response.success:
        print(f"Sandbox restored! Restored from snapshot: {restore_response.snapshot_uid}")
finally:
    sandbox.terminate()
```

## `test_podsnapshot_extension.py`

This file, located in the parent directory (`clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/`), contains an integration test script for the `PodSnapshotSandboxClient` extension. It verifies the snapshot and restore functionality.

### Test Phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Starting Counter Sandbox, Suspend, Resume & Snapshot Deletion**:
    - Starts a sandbox with a counter application.
    - Takes two manual snapshots (`test-snapshot-10` and `test-snapshot-20`).
    - Suspends and resumes the active sandbox.
    - Verifies lists of all snapshots, deletes a specific snapshot by UID, and cleans up the rest.
2.  **Phase 2: Testing Suspend/Resume on a New Sandbox Instance**:
    - Launches a new sandbox instance and suspends it to take a state snapshot.
    - Resumes the new sandbox instance, which restores from the sandbox's snapshot.
    - Cleans up the snapshot from the system.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python Virtual Environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install kubernetes
    pip install -e clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/
    ```

3.  **Pod Snapshot Controller**: The Pod Snapshot controller must be installed in a **GKE standard cluster** (version >= 1.35.2-gke.1842000) running with **gVisor**.

- For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [GKE Pod Snapshots public documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-snapshots).
- Ensure a GCS bucket is configured to store the pod snapshot states and that the necessary IAM permissions are applied.

4.  **CRDs**: `PodSnapshotStorageConfig`, `PodSnapshotPolicy` CRDs must be applied. As a requirement, the label `agents.x-k8s.io/sandbox-name-hash` must be added to the `PodSnapshotPolicy` grouping rules.

    Example `PodSnapshotPolicy`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: podsnapshot.gke.io/v1
    kind: PodSnapshotPolicy
    metadata:
      name: example-psp-workload
      namespace: sandbox-test
    spec:
      storageConfigName: example-pssc-gcs
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: agent-sandbox-workload
      triggerConfig:
        type: manual
        postCheckpoint: resume
      snapshotGroupingRules:
        groupByLabelValue:
          labels: ["agents.x-k8s.io/sandbox-name-hash"]
          groupRetentionPolicy:
            maxSnapshotCountPerGroup: 3
    ```
4.  **Sandbox Template**: A `SandboxTemplate` (e.g., `python-counter-template`) referencing a template with runtime gVisor, appropriate KSA and label that matches that selector label in `PodSnapshotPolicy` must be available in the cluster.

5.  **Sandbox WarmPool**: A `SandboxWarmPool` (e.g., `python-counter-pool`) with appropriate replica count that references the `SandboxTemplate` must be available in the cluster.

### Running Tests:

To run the integration test, execute the script with the appropriate arguments:

```bash
python3 clients/python/agentic-sandbox-client/test_podsnapshot_extension.py \
  --warmpool-name python-counter-pool \
  --namespace sandbox-test
```

Adjust the `--namespace`, `--warmpool-name` as needed for your environment.
