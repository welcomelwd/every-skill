# agent-sandbox-operator
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) packaging for [Agent Sandbox](https://agent-sandbox.sigs.k8s.io): it installs the controller, CRDs (`Sandbox` and extension APIs), and RBAC so you can deploy Agent Sandbox from OperatorHub, OpenShift, or any cluster that consumes OLM bundles—without applying the upstream `k8s/` manifests by hand.

## Description

[Agent Sandbox](https://agent-sandbox.sigs.k8s.io) is a Kubernetes SIG Apps project that provides a declarative API for long-running, stateful, singleton workloads—think isolated dev environments, notebooks, or AI agent runtimes backed by a single pod with stable identity and optional persistent storage. The core `Sandbox` CRD manages that lifecycle; the extension APIs (`SandboxTemplate`, `SandboxClaim`, and `SandboxWarmPool`) add templating, claim-based provisioning, and warm pools for faster startup.

The operator packages the upstream Agent Sandbox controller (including extension reconcilers) for **Operator Lifecycle Manager**: CRDs, RBAC, metrics Service, and Deployment are kept in sync with the main project’s `k8s/` manifests via `hack/sync-k8s-manifests`, then published as an OLM bundle (`make bundle`) for installation on OpenShift, OperatorHub, or any OLM-enabled cluster. After install, you create and manage `Sandbox` and extension resources the same way as with a plain manifest deploy—see the [project docs](https://agent-sandbox.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) and [examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/tree/main/examples) for API usage and samples.

## Installation

This directory packages Agent Sandbox for **OLM** (OperatorHub, OpenShift, and other catalog-driven installs). It is not the primary install path for most clusters.

| Method | Where to start |
| --- | --- |
| Release manifests (`kubectl apply`) | [Installation](../README.md#installation) in the repo root README (generated from [`k8s/`](../k8s/)) |
| Helm | [`helm/README.md`](../helm/README.md) |
| OLM bundle | Published operator catalog, or [Releasing a new operator version](#releasing-a-new-operator-version) / [Testing a bundle locally](#testing-a-bundle-locally) below |

For controller development (local kind cluster, image build), see [docs/development.md](../docs/development.md).

## Maintaining operator manifests

CRDs, ClusterRoles, and the controller Deployment in this module are **copies** of the main Agent Sandbox tree. They are not authored separately under `olm/config/`.

### Single source of truth

| Layer | Location | How it changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API types and kubebuilder markers | [`api/`](../api/), [`extensions/api/`](../extensions/api/) | Edit Go types and controller RBAC markers |
| Generated install YAML | [`k8s/`](../k8s/) (`crds/`, `rbac.generated.yaml`, `controller.yaml`, `extensions.controller.yaml`, …) | From the **repo root**: `make fix-go-generate` (or `make all`) |
| Operator SDK / OLM config | `olm/config/` | From the **repo root**: `make fix-go-generate` (or `make fix-olm-manifests`); equivalent to `make manifests` in this directory |

Contributors should **not** hand-edit the synced paths below. Change the upstream API or manifests, regenerate `k8s/`, then refresh the operator config.

### Synced paths (do not edit by hand)

`make copy-k8s-config` (also run as the `manifests` target) copies from `../k8s` (`K8S_ROOT`, default one level above this module):

- `k8s/crds/*.yaml` → `config/crd/bases/` and `config/crd/kustomization.yaml` (resource list derived from copied CRDs)
- `k8s/rbac.generated.yaml` → `config/rbac/role.yaml`
- `k8s/extensions-rbac.generated.yaml` → `config/rbac/extensions_role.yaml`
- `k8s/extensions.yaml` → `config/rbac/extensions_role_binding.yaml`
- `k8s/controller.yaml` and `k8s/extensions.controller.yaml` → `config/rbac/support.yaml` and `config/manager/manager.yaml` via [`hack/sync-k8s-manifests`](hack/sync-k8s-manifests/) (Namespace, ServiceAccount, bindings, Service, extensions Deployment; image placeholder rewritten for the operator image)

Run from `olm/`:

```sh
make manifests
# equivalent:
make copy-k8s-config
```

Other `make` targets (`test`, `deploy`, `bundle`, …) depend on `manifests` and will run the sync when needed.

### Typical workflow

1. Change API or controller code in the parent repo; run `make fix-go-generate` at the repo root. This regenerates `k8s/` and syncs `olm/config/` (via [`dev/tools/fix-olm-manifests`](../dev/tools/fix-olm-manifests) in [`codegen.go`](../codegen.go)).
2. Commit the updated `k8s/` output and synced `config/crd/bases/`, `config/rbac/`, and `config/manager/manager.yaml` together with any OLM bundle changes (`make bundle` when publishing).

### Operator-only config (safe to edit)

OLM and kubebuilder scaffolding that are **not** overwritten by `copy-k8s-config` include, for example: `config/manifests/` (ClusterServiceVersion), `config/default/`, `config/prometheus/`, `config/network-policy/`, `config/scorecard/`, and `config/samples/`. Adjust those when changing catalog metadata, metrics wiring, or install UX—not when updating CRD schemas or controller RBAC.

### Releasing a new operator version

From `olm/`, after syncing manifests and ensuring the controller image you want is published, set the release version and controller image, generate the OLM bundle, then build and push the bundle image:

```sh
export VERSION=0.4.6
export IMG=registry.k8s.io/agent-sandbox/agent-sandbox-controller:v${VERSION}
export IMAGE_TAG_BASE=quay.io/you/agent-sandbox-operator   # required for bundle-build; or set BUNDLE_IMG instead

make bundle
make bundle-build
make bundle-push
```

`make bundle` refreshes `config/` from `../k8s`, stamps the CSV with `VERSION`, and sets the related image to `IMG`. Set `IMAGE_TAG_BASE` to your OCI registry prefix before `bundle-build` / `bundle-push`; `BUNDLE_IMG` is then `${IMAGE_TAG_BASE}-bundle:v${VERSION}`. Override the full tag with `BUNDLE_IMG` if needed (e.g. `make bundle-push BUNDLE_IMG=quay.io/you/agent-sandbox-operator-bundle:v0.4.6`). You need registry credentials and a container runtime (`docker` or `podman`) for `bundle-build` / `bundle-push`.

### Testing a bundle locally

Log in to a Kubernetes cluster that can run OLM (for example OpenShift, or a kind cluster with OLM installed). From `olm/`:

```sh
export VERSION=0.4.6
export IMG=registry.k8s.io/agent-sandbox/agent-sandbox-controller:v${VERSION}
export IMAGE_TAG_BASE=your-registry/agent-sandbox-operator   # required for bundle-build
export BUNDLE_IMG=${IMAGE_TAG_BASE}-bundle:v${VERSION}         # or set BUNDLE_IMG directly

make bundle
make bundle-build

operator-sdk run bundle ${BUNDLE_IMG}
```

`operator-sdk run bundle` installs the bundle into the cluster’s OLM namespace so you can subscribe and verify the operator before publishing. Use the same `VERSION`, `IMG`, and `BUNDLE_IMG` you intend to ship.

> **Note:** The CRD conversion webhook `clientConfig` hardcodes `namespace: agent-sandbox-system`. Because `webhookdefinitions` is stripped from the CSV (preventing OLM from rewriting the `clientConfig`), the operator **must** be installed in the `agent-sandbox-system` namespace for conversion webhooks to function. If you use `operator-sdk run bundle`, pass `--namespace agent-sandbox-system`; the `operatorframework.io/suggested-namespace` annotation is only a hint and is not enforced.
