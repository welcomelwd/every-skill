"""Idempotent atespace bootstrap shared by every locust test.

CreateAtespace returns ALREADY_EXISTS once the atespace is in place; that
is the success signal for the second caller, so concurrent users can race
without coordinating. The call is wrapped in traced_grpc so it shows up
in locust stats / traces alongside every other API call.
