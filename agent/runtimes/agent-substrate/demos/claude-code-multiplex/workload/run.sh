# Demo workload entrypoint: periodically invokes Claude Code with a task and
# idles between intervals. The idle window is what substrate uses to suspend
# this actor and multiplex its worker onto another actor.
#
# Env vars:
#   TASK              — the prompt to pass to claude-code each tick
#   INTERVAL_SECONDS  — sleep length between ticks (longer = more multiplex headroom)
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY — required; supplied via container env
