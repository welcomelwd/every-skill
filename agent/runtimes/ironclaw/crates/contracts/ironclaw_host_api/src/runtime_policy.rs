//! Runtime policy vocabulary for IronClaw Reborn.
//!
//! This module is the contract vocabulary for runtime presets. It defines the
//! enums and the resolved-policy aggregate type, but it does not implement the
//! resolver — the deployment × profile × tenant/org policy → effective policy
//! resolver lives in `ironclaw_runtime_policy` (or
//! `ironclaw_host_runtime::policy`) and is the only sanctioned producer of
//! [`EffectiveRuntimePolicy`].
//!
//! ## What lives here
//!
//! - [`DeploymentMode`] — where IronClaw is running and who owns the machine
//!   boundary.
//! - [`RuntimeProfile`] — which preset the operator/user requested.
//! - [`EffectiveRuntimePolicy`] — the resolved policy the runtime actually
//!   enforces.
//! - Backend/policy enums consumed by [`EffectiveRuntimePolicy`]:
//!   [`FilesystemBackendKind`], [`ProcessBackendKind`], [`NetworkMode`],
//!   [`SecretMode`], [`ApprovalPolicy`], [`AuditMode`].
//!
//! ## What does *not* live here
//!
//! - The resolver itself.
//! - Authority decisions (capability grants, leases, approvals) — those stay in
//!   `ironclaw_authorization` / future `ironclaw_capabilities`.
//! - Execution mechanics (script/wasm/mcp runners) — those stay in their
//!   respective runtime crates.
//!
//! ## Distinction from [`crate::runtime::RuntimeKind`]
//!
//! [`crate::runtime::RuntimeKind`] answers *what kind of work is being performed*
//! (Wasm / Mcp / Script / FirstParty / System). [`RuntimeProfile`] answers
//! *where and how that work is executed and with what authority*. Do not add a
//! `Local` variant to [`crate::runtime::RuntimeKind`] — locality and authority belong
//! to runtime policy, not to the execution lane.
//!
//! ## Distinction from [`crate::runtime::TrustClass`]
//!
//! [`crate::runtime::TrustClass`] is a per-invocation authority ceiling produced by the
//! trust policy engine for a specific package/extension. [`RuntimeProfile`] is
//! a deployment-scoped policy preset chosen by the operator; the resolver
//! turns it into [`EffectiveRuntimePolicy`] which then constrains the
//! filesystem/process/network/secret backends offered to every invocation.
//! Trust and runtime policy compose: a `LocalHost` + `Sandbox` invocation is
//! still bounded by both.
//!
//! ## Wire format
//!
//! All enums serialize as `snake_case` strings to keep audit logs and
//! settings/blueprint TOML readable. [`EffectiveRuntimePolicy`] is a simple
//! aggregate of those enums plus the requested/resolved profile pair so audit
//! can render "you asked for X, you got Y" when deployment or tenant/org
//! policy reduces authority.
