//! Slice-C kernel vocabulary — the capability result channels.
//!
//! Part of the capability-path result collapse
//! (`docs/internal/reborn/contracts/capability-access.md`,
//! §5.3). Today a single overloaded ten-variant `CapabilityOutcome`
//! (`ironclaw_turns`) carries every non-happy path, and a recoverable
//! `Ok(Failed)` is structurally indistinguishable from a run-terminating `Err`
//! (§1.2). The target model replaces that with **five distinct channels** — one
//! per real outcome kind:
//!
//! - [`crate::failure::HostFailure`] — infrastructure failure (the `Err` arm; already landed).
//! - `Outcome` — tool success or recoverable failure (a later slice).
//! - a terminal `Denied` — model-visible policy denial, **not** re-entrant.
//! - [`Blocked`] — re-entrant gates (this module).
//! - [`Suspension`] — parked work (this module).
//!
//! and folds them into one `Resolution` (a later slice, once `Outcome` exists).
//! This module lands the two gate/suspension channels first, additively (§9) —
//! nothing produces them yet.
//!
//! ## Blocked vs. Suspension — the distinction that matters
//!
//! Both pause the invocation, but they resume differently:
//!
//! - **[`Blocked`]** is a *re-entrant gate*: the call did not run, and once the
//!   gate is resolved (approval granted, credential supplied, resource freed) the
//!   invocation re-enters `authorize()` and may run. It is the request asking for
//!   a decision.
//! - **[`Suspension`]** is *parked work*: the effect is already in flight (a
//!   spawned process) or has been handed off (a dependent run, a client-executed
//!   external tool), and control either continues elsewhere or returns to the API
//!   client until the awaited thing completes.
//!
//! Getting these confused is the #6137 bug class; keeping them separate types
//! makes the confusion a compile error rather than a runtime mis-route.
