//! Slice-C kernel vocabulary — the "render from record" result contract.
//!
//! Part of the capability-path result collapse
//! (`docs/internal/reborn/contracts/capability-access.md`
//! §5.2.9). [`Resolution`](crate::resolution::Resolution)'s control-plane arms carry only
//! *opaque* refs — [`GateRef`](crate::ids::GateRef), [`DenyRef`](crate::ids::DenyRef),
//! [`ResultRef`](crate::ids::ResultRef) — never inline content. The records in this
//! module are the durably-stored, model-visible payloads those refs point at:
//! the loop renders a pending gate or a denial **from** the referenced record,
//! and never reconstructs it from data it already had in hand.
//!
//! ## The rendering contract (§5.2.9)
//!
//! - A [`Resolution::Denied(DenyRef)`](crate::resolution::Resolution::Denied) renders its
//!   model-visible denial from the [`DenyRecord`] keyed by that `DenyRef`.
//! - A [`Blocked`](crate::resolution::Blocked) / gate-shaped
//!   [`Suspension`](crate::resolution::Suspension) renders its pending-gate content from the
//!   [`GateRecord`] keyed by that `GateRef`. The `GateRecord` is also where the
//!   resume/credential payload (the auth gate's
//!   [`RuntimeCredentialAuthRequirement`](crate::decision::RuntimeCredentialAuthRequirement)s,
//!   G3) and the dependent-run staged result (G2) live — content that today
//!   rides inline on the old `CapabilityOutcome` variants.
//!
//! ## Redaction invariant
//!
//! These records are **model-visible** and therefore MUST already be redacted:
//! every one carries a [`SafeSummary`](crate::safe_summary::SafeSummary), never raw text. The
//! loop renders credential requirements FROM the [`GateRecord::Auth`] record —
//! it never reconstructs a credential demand from model-visible data
//! (`capability-access.md`, `safety-and-sandbox.md`). Keeping the requirement on the
//! host-owned record, not on any model-derived value, is what makes an auth gate
//! forge-proof.
//!
//! Introduced additively (§9): nothing produces or renders these yet — the
//! result-channel migration slice wires them alongside the `Resolution` umbrella.
