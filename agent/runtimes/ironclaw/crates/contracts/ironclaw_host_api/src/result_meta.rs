//! Slice-C kernel vocabulary — loop-derived result metadata, gate resume
//! identity, and preserved originating loop refs (arch-simplification §3/§5.3
//! **Stage 1**).
//!
//! These types make [`Resolution`](crate::resolution::Resolution) a **non-lossy** carrier for
//! every `CapabilityOutcome` case, so a later stage can delete that overloaded
//! enum (§5.3). Today the `CapabilityOutcome` → `Resolution` mapping drops five
//! classes of field for want of a host_api home (the old "G1/G4 dropped"
//! comments). This module gives each a home:
//!
//! - [`FailureKind`] — the recovery classification on a recoverable failure
//!   (was `CapabilityFailure::error_kind`); it drives retry-vs-terminal.
//! - [`ResultProgress`] / [`TerminateHint`] / [`OutputDigest`] — the loop-derived
//!   completion signals (was `CapabilityResultMessage::{progress, terminate_hint,
//!   output_digest}`, the "G4" fields).
//! - [`ResumeToken`] — the opaque gate-resume identity (was the `resume_token`
//!   inside `approval_resume` / `auth_resume`); the loop echoes it back to resume
//!   a gate. Only the *token* crosses — the raw input/estimate replay payload it
//!   was bundled with stays host-side (charter: no raw input in vocabulary).
//! - [`LoopRef`] — the preserved *originating* loop ref (`result:*` / `gate:*` /
//!   `process:*`), so the loop/evidence layer can still reach state it keyed under
//!   its own ref after the kernel handle (a fresh uuid) is minted.
//!
//! ## Charter
//!
//! Every type here is **plain redacted vocabulary** (host_api charter): a bounded
//! enum, a fixed-width hash value, or a bounded validated safe identifier. The
//! narrow exception is [`ModelDiagnostic`], which carries a bounded,
//! producer-scrubbed cause needed for model recovery. No type carries a secret,
//! a typed raw `HostPath`, an unscrubbed backend error, or a runtime handle. A
//! [`LoopRef`] is a bounded correlation identifier with path delimiters and
//! control characters refused at construction — not free text, and distinct
//! from the kernel record refs ([`GateRef`](crate::ids::GateRef) et al.), which stay
//! opaque uuids precisely so a caller cannot compose one from a string.
