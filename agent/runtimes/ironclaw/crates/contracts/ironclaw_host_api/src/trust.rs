//! Requested-trust vocabulary for IronClaw Reborn.
//!
//! This module is the *input* side of the host trust policy boundary. Manifests,
//! registry entries, and admin configuration deserialize into [`PackageIdentity`]
//! and [`RequestedTrustClass`]; the host policy engine in `ironclaw_trust`
//! consumes them and produces an effective trust decision.
//!
//! The split is deliberate: [`crate::runtime::TrustClass`] (in `runtime`) is the
//! *effective* ceiling that downstream authorization consumes, and its
//! privileged variants (`FirstParty`, `System`) reject `serde` deserialization.
//! [`RequestedTrustClass`] is the *declared* counterpart — it can be safely
//! deserialized from any source, including untrusted user manifests, because
//! it cannot be confused with effective trust at the type level.
//!
//! ## Cross-crate vocabulary
//!
//! - The manifest field `trust = "..."` parses into [`RequestedTrustClass`]
//!   (snake_case mapping: `untrusted`, `third_party`, `first_party_requested`,
//!   `system_requested`). It is metadata — never authority.
//! - [`PackageIdentity`] is the trust-policy-side identity for any
//!   manifest-bearing package: installed extensions (WASM / Script / MCP),
//!   bundled extensions / loops / skills, operator-declared packages, and
//!   eventual built-in tools (see `crates/kernel/ironclaw_trust/CONTRACT.md` §9 for
//!   the migration path).
//! - The `package_id: PackageId` field on [`PackageIdentity`] is the same
//!   value as `ExtensionId` at other layers — `ExtensionId` when the
//!   identity reaches the extension registry / `CapabilityDescriptor.provider`,
//!   `PackageId` when it reaches the trust policy. The two names describe
//!   the same value at different layers.
//! - [`crate::capability::CapabilityDescriptor::trust_ceiling`] mirrors the manifest's
//!   declared trust as `TrustClass` — it is *declarative metadata*, not the
//!   policy-validated effective ceiling. The privileged variants of
//!   `TrustClass` reject deserialization, so this field can only carry
//!   `Sandbox` / `UserTrusted` from manifest input. Effective trust comes
//!   from `ironclaw_trust::TrustPolicy::evaluate` and is attached to
//!   [`crate::scope::ExecutionContext::trust`] at dispatch time.
//!
//! See `ironclaw_trust::TrustPolicy` for the engine that bridges request to
//! effective trust, `crates/kernel/ironclaw_trust/CONTRACT.md` for the full
//! evaluation matrix, and `docs/internal/reborn/contracts/host-api.md` (in the
//! staging-track docs) for the broader Reborn vocabulary.
