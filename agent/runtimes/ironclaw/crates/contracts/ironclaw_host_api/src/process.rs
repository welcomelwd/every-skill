//! Placement-neutral process-execution vocabulary and the sandbox transport
//! port.
//!
//! The kernel decides *which* process port receives a command; a lane provides
//! the transport that runs it. Declaring both halves here is what lets a
//! `runtimes`-layer lane implement what the kernel consumes without an upward
//! dependency: `ironclaw_sandbox` (runtimes) implements
//! [`SandboxCommandTransport`], `ironclaw_host_runtime` (kernel) wraps it in
//! `UserSandboxProcessPort`. PROPOSAL §6.6.4 records that this home is
//! load-bearing, not cosmetic.
//!
//! `ironclaw_host_runtime` still owns the *behavior* — process spawning, output
//! capture, alias rewriting, and the local-host port. Only the shapes that
//! cross the kernel↔lane seam live here.
