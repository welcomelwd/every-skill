//! Slice-C kernel vocabulary — the sealed `Authorized` witness.
//!
//! The security-critical heart of the capability-path collapse
//! (`docs/internal/reborn/contracts/capability-access.md`,
//! §5.3.2). `authorize()` folds ALL pre-flightable policy (trust, approval,
//! resource reservation, lane resolution) into a single decision; its success
//! value is an [`Authorized`] — the proof that this exact [`Invocation`] passed
//! that fold. `dispatch()` accepts *only* an `Authorized`, so an un-authorized
//! invocation is structurally undispatchable.
//!
//! ## The seal (decision 2026-07-18: `host_api` + witness token)
//!
//! `Authorized` lives here (the bottom crate everyone references), but its fields
//! are **private** and there is no public field constructor. The only way to mint
//! one is [`Authorized::seal`], which consumes an [`AuthorizationGrant`] — a
//! zero-sized witness whose *only* constructor is
//! [`CapabilityAuthorizer::authorization_grant`]. So you cannot build an
//! `Authorized` without holding a `&impl CapabilityAuthorizer`.
//!
//! Pure cross-crate type-sealing is not expressible in Rust: `host_api` defines
//! the type but the *kernel* (`ironclaw_capabilities`) is the sole legitimate
//! minter, and those are different crates. The witness gives the structural
//! barrier (private fields + grant-gated construction); a companion
//! `ironclaw_architecture_tests` test restricts `impl CapabilityAuthorizer` to the
//! kernel crate — type-seal plus test-seal. **Per §9 the seal's *guarantee* is
//! vacuous until `authorize()` inlines the four policy checks** (that later PR is
//! the explicit security milestone); this slice lands the structural witness so
//! `dispatch()`'s signature can demand it.
