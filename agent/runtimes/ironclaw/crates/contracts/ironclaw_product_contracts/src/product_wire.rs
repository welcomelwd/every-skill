//! The `Reborn*` product wire DTOs — the JSON shapes every product transport
//! serializes across the `ProductSurface` boundary (PROPOSAL §6.1.3, "product
//! wire DTO homes").
//!
//! WebUI, the OpenAI-compatible adapter, and the operator surface all speak
//! these; none of them should compile `ironclaw_assistant` to name a response
//! body. The *inventory* of concrete commands, capabilities, and views that
//! produce them stays in product as its frozen surface — this module is the
//! payload vocabulary only, and holds no service, handler, or projection
//! reducer.
//!
//! Nine of this family's members could not follow it here and stay in
//! `ironclaw_assistant::reborn_services::types`, each because its fields name a
//! crate outside the contracts allowlist (`ironclaw_host_api` +
//! `ironclaw_extension_contracts`): `RebornCreateThreadResponse`,
//! `RebornListThreadsResponse` and `RebornTimelineResponse` carry
//! `ironclaw_threads` records; `RebornAuthAccount`, `RebornVendorAuthAccounts`,
//! `RebornExtensionInfo` and `RebornExtensionListResponse` carry `ironclaw_auth`
//! account state; `RebornGetRunStateResponse` carries
//! `ironclaw_common::llm_costs::RunCost` and
//! `ironclaw_loop_contracts::LoopModelUsage`; and
//! `RebornExecuteProductCommandResponse` carries
//! `ironclaw_assistant::commands::CommandResultView`, the command grammar §6.9.1
//! keeps there.
//!
//! The three `From<ironclaw_turns::…>` conversions stayed too — with both sides
//! outside product they would be orphan impls, so they are free functions there.
// arch-exempt: large_file, one contract surface — splitting by feature area at move time would give the same names two import paths, plan #7008
