//! Conversation binding resolution — the port and the DTOs that cross it.
//!
//! Maps external adapter references (external actor, external conversation) to
//! canonical Reborn identifiers (tenant, user, thread, agent/project scope).
//!
//! **Why this is a contract and not product's own** (§12.11 D-A): the channel
//! host's per-extension workflow factory returns a live binding service to its
//! caller, and the caller sits *below* product. The port therefore has to be
//! declared at the boundary, which is only possible now that its request and
//! response DTOs name nothing but `ironclaw_host_api` and
//! `ironclaw_extension_contracts` vocabulary. The error is the boundary error
//! ([`ProductOperationFailure`]) for the same reason; `ironclaw_assistant`
//! absorbs it into its workflow error with a total, discriminant-preserving
//! `From`, so a product call site keeps every distinction it had.
