//! The error vocabulary of the product-side ports.
//!
//! [`ProductOperationFailure`] is what a crate *below or beside* product may
//! say when a product-side port it implements fails. It is deliberately the
//! smaller of the two product error types:
//!
//! - **`ProductOperationFailure` (here)** — the boundary vocabulary. Every
//!   variant carries a plain `String` or nothing at all, so the type names no
//!   kernel, domain, or workflow type and satisfies this crate's dependency
//!   ceiling (`ironclaw_host_api` + `ironclaw_extension_contracts`, §6.1.3).
//!   A port implementor never needs more than this to describe its own
//!   failure.
//! - **`ironclaw_assistant::ProductSurfaceFailure`** — the workflow vocabulary.
//!   It is a strict superset: it adds the turn-coordinator, interaction, and
//!   idempotency variants whose payloads are kernel types
//!   (`ironclaw_turns::TurnError`) or product-internal rejection kinds, which
//!   only the workflow crate produces and only the workflow crate reads.
//!   `ironclaw_assistant` absorbs this type into that one with a total,
//!   information-preserving `From`, so `?` at a product call site keeps
//!   working unchanged.
//!
//! The split is where the two vocabularies actually diverge, measured rather
//! than chosen: `ironclaw_extension_host` constructs exactly the six variants
//! below across its 19 production files, and none of the kernel-typed ones.
//! See `docs/internal/reborn/target-architecture/PROPOSAL.md` §6.1.3 for the recorded
//! decision and the alternatives it beat.
