//! The operator control plane's secret-value port (PROPOSAL §6.2.2, §8.2,
//! CHECKLIST WS3 — "tighten direct `secrets` consumers").
//!
//! `ironclaw_operator` stores one class of secret: the API-key **values** an
//! operator pastes into the WebChat v2 Inference tab, which are re-injected into
//! the resolved `LlmConfig` at provider-build and reload time. Reaching that
//! storage used to mean holding `ironclaw_secrets` — the substrate that owns
//! CAS one-shot leases, AAD/crypto, and the OS keychain master key — directly
//! from the products tier. §8.2's product row says the products tier loses that
//! edge; this port is the replacement, and PROPOSAL §12.1b is why it lands
//! *before* the edge is removed rather than with it.
//!
//! **The port is narrower than the substrate on purpose, in three ways.**
//!
//! 1. **No lease vocabulary.** `SecretStorePort` exposes a lease/consume CAS
//!    protocol whose whole point is that a staged one-shot credential is
//!    consumed exactly once by a runtime lane. The operator does not stage
//!    anything for a lane — it reads a configuration value back on every
//!    provider reload — so [`OperatorSecretValueStore::read`] is a plain
//!    repeatable read and the lease dance stays behind the implementor. A
//!    products-tier caller cannot reach the staging protocol through this port
//!    at all.
//! 2. **No scope argument.** The implementor fixes the scope. LLM configuration
//!    is operator-wide (a single instance config, not per-user), and with the
//!    scope in the caller's hands nothing stopped a products-tier caller
//!    addressing a *tenant's* secrets through the same handle. Now it cannot
//!    name a scope, so it cannot reach one.
//! 3. **No substrate error detail.** [`OperatorSecretValueStoreError`] carries
//!    only a stable classification string. The substrate's error Display can
//!    name handles and backend detail; that no longer crosses into the product
//!    tier, into an operator log line, or into a `Display` a route might
//!    surface.
//!
//! What the operator keeps is its own policy: which handle a provider id maps to
//! (`llm_provider_<id>_api_key`) and what to do when a read comes back empty.
//! That is naming and fail-closed behaviour, and it belongs with the control
//! plane, not with assembly.
