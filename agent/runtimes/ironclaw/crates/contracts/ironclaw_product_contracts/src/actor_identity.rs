//! External-actor → Reborn user resolution.
//!
//! A channel surface knows only a protocol-shaped actor (`ExternalActorRef`);
//! which Reborn user that actor *is* depends on host-owned identity bindings
//! product does not read. So product asks a resolver wired beside it.
//!
//! The port is declared here and implemented by the extension host (PROPOSAL
//! §6.1.3) — the same shape as [`crate::shared_admission`]. It became declarable
//! here once two things stopped blocking it: the error is no longer product's
//! workflow type (see [`crate::error::ProductOperationFailure`], WS2.2), and
//! the binding epoch its response carries is no longer
//! `ironclaw_conversations`' — it moved to
//! `ironclaw_extension_contracts::external`, beside the actor ref whose binding
//! it versions.
