//! The vendor-authored preference reply-target codec port.
//!
//! Stored outbound preferences persist a [`ReplyTargetBindingRef`] whose
//! grammar is authored by the channel's vendor integration (the channel
//! extension crate), so both halves live there. This port is the only place
//! vendor knowledge enters the generic outbound-target and triggered-delivery
//! paths — which is exactly why it is extension-tier contract vocabulary and
//! not product vocabulary: the implementors are the channel packages, and the
//! callers are the generic delivery paths above them.
