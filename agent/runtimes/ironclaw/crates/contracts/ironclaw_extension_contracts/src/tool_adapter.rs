//! The extension **tool adapter** contract.
//!
//! One adapter instance per extension, one method: given validated input for
//! a declared (or MCP-discovered) capability, do the work
//! (`docs/internal/reborn/extension-runtime/overview.md` §4.1). Everything else —
//! what tools exist, listing, validation, authorization, approvals,
//! obligations, resource reservation, credential injection, events, audit —
//! is manifest data or the host dispatcher pipeline. Adapters never report
//! metadata, and discovery is never part of this ABI.
//!
//! This module is call vocabulary, not wire vocabulary: a [`ToolCall`] is an
//! in-process envelope the dispatcher builds per invocation; nothing here
//! serializes.
