# ironclaw_loop_contracts — working rules

Canonical crate guidance (the crate's `CLAUDE.md` is a pointer here).
Orientation and public surface: [`README.md`](./README.md). Family boundary
and admission test: [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). Specified by PROPOSAL
§6.1.4 and `docs/internal/reborn/target-architecture/families/contracts.md`.

This crate exists so `ironclaw_agent_loop` — the one artifact meant to be
replaced wholesale without touching anything privileged — can satisfy its
"contracts-layer dependencies only" rule with **zero** layer-matrix
exceptions. Every rule below serves that.

## Boundaries

- **The direction inverts, always.** Nothing here may depend on
  `ironclaw_turns`. The turn kernel implements and validates *against* these
  contracts; a dependency the other way would make the whole crate pointless.
  Pinned by the `ironclaw_loop_contracts` allowlist in
  `reborn_dependency_boundaries.rs` (§11.2.3).
- **Internal dependencies:** the manifest holds `ironclaw_host_api` and
  `ironclaw_extension_contracts` (the latter because `LoopRuntimeContext`
  carries `Option<ChannelPresentation>` and `render_presentation_hint` reads
  it — sanctioned by §8.2's contracts row). The enforced allowlist
  (`loop_contracts_allowed`) additionally *permits* `ironclaw_common` and
  `ironclaw_prompt_envelope`, which the crate does not currently use. Nothing
  else, ever — the allowlist forbids every other workspace crate rather than
  naming today's offenders. (Earlier guidance listed
  `host_api`/`common`/`prompt_envelope` as the held set; the manifest and the
  gate are the truth, and they disagree with that list in both directions.)
- **No framework, driver, or runtime client** — no axum, reqwest, wasmtime,
  libsql, deadpool, tokio-postgres, sqlx. Pinned by
  `reborn_contracts_crates_hold_no_framework_dependencies`. `tokio` is present
  with the `rt` feature only, for the one `JoinHandle` in
  `CommunicationContextFetch::Spawned`; that carve-out is documented in the
  manifest and in the test, and widening it is a deliberate edit.
- **No implementation of a port declared here.** `LoopExit` validation, the
  exit applier, the coordinator, and the state store are turn-kernel
  authority. `Loop*Port` implementations live in `ironclaw_loop_host`,
  `ironclaw_turn_runner`, and `ironclaw_hooks` — the single declared decorator
  chain (`docs/internal/reborn/target-architecture/families/loop.md`).
- **No prompt content, no model-gateway implementation.** (Two inherited
  exceptions, recorded under "Known debt" below.)
- Public/wire DTOs carry refs, bounded safe summaries, typed ids, versions,
  cursors, and sanitized errors. Transient prompt-construction types may carry
  bounded, host-approved model-visible content, but must not be serde
  wire/public DTOs. Raw prompt text, raw assistant content, tool input JSON,
  secrets, host paths, and backend errors stay behind host implementations.

## Turn vocabulary is not ours

`TurnId`/`TurnRunId`/`TurnScope`/`TurnActor`, the gate/message/result refs,
`TurnStatus`, `RunProfileId`/`RunProfileVersion`/`RunProfileRequest`,
`ProductTurnContext`, `GateResumeDisposition` — all of these live in
`ironclaw_host_api::turn`. Import them from there. This crate deliberately
does **not** re-export them: one type, one import path.

## Adding code

- Add a field only when every host implementation can honor the neutral
  contract; keep defaults fail-closed when a concrete host has not implemented
  a new capability yet.
- Add a port trait when the loop needs a new host-owned capability — and add
  its row to `LOOP_PORT_OWNERS` in
  `crates/app/ironclaw_architecture_tests/tests/reborn_loop_port_location_scan.rs`
  in the same change. The scan fails on an unowned port by design.
- Add a new file when a contract has a separate lifecycle or validation model.
  No `common`, `misc`, or `helpers` modules.
- Ports are **not** sealed: they exist to be implemented by crates above this
  one. The sealed-trait pattern belongs to `ironclaw_agent_loop`'s strategy
  slots (`crates/loop/ironclaw_agent_loop/src/planner.rs`), which stay there.

## Common mistakes

- Importing a lower runtime crate to make a contract convenient.
- Putting production adapter wiring in profile resolution.
- Re-exporting a `Loop*Port` from another crate — that is the §11.2.4
  re-export-path trap, and `reborn_loop_port_location_scan` fails on it.
- Making a safe-summary field carry raw content by convention.

## Known debt (recorded, not accepted)

- `instruction_bundle.rs` embeds two prompt assets
  (`prompts/capability_surface_usage_policy.md` and `prompts/delivery.md`)
  through `include_str!`.
  PROPOSAL §6.1.4 says a contracts crate holds no prompt content; the module
  moved here anyway because `ironclaw_hooks` consumes
  `InstructionMaterializationStore` and leaving it in the turn kernel would
  have kept the `hooks → turns` exception alive. The resolution §6.7.2 points
  at is hoisting `InstructionBundleBuilder` (the behavior) to
  `ironclaw_loop_host` and leaving the bundle/store *types* here — a WS4 item
  on the CHECKLIST `loop_host` re-charter row.

## Validation

- Fast local check: `cargo test -p ironclaw_loop_contracts`
- Boundary/scan/ceiling gates: `cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests`
