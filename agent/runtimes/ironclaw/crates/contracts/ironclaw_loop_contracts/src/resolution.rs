//! Producer-facing constructors that emit a host_api [`Resolution`] directly
//! (arch-simplification §3/§5.3 Stage 2b — the collapse complete).
//!
//! This module replaces the transitional `CapabilityOutcome` → `Resolution`
//! mapping artifact. Instead of building an intermediate ten-variant
//! `CapabilityOutcome` and mapping it, every capability producer calls the
//! constructor for the channel it means:
//!
//! - Non-gate channels return a bare [`Resolution`]: [`completed`], [`failed`],
//!   [`spawned_process`], [`spawned_child_run`].
//! - Gate/suspension channels return a [`GatedResolution`] (the [`Resolution`]
//!   plus the durable [`GateRecord`] its opaque ref renders from, §5.2.9), which
//!   the loop-host seam persists before returning the resolution:
//!   [`approval_required`], [`auth_required`], [`resource_blocked`],
//!   [`await_dependent_run`], [`external_tool_pending`].
//! - A terminal denial returns a [`DeniedResolution`] (the [`Resolution`] plus a
//!   sibling [`DenyRecord`]; a denial is terminal and same-turn, so the record
//!   is NOT persisted — the model-visible reason/summary ride the channel): [`denied`].
//!
//! These are free functions in `ironclaw_turns` (NOT methods on
//! `host_api::Resolution`): the non-lossy redaction below consumes loop-facing
//! vocabulary (`CapabilityFailureDetail`, `ModelVisibleToolObservation`,
//! `LoopGateRef`, …) that lives in this crate, and `host_api` sits below it.
//! `turns` is the lowest crate that sees both sides.
//!
//! ## Non-lossy carry (§5.3)
//!
//! `host_api::Resolution` carries **every recoverable field** the old
//! `CapabilityOutcome` variants held, via the vocabulary in
//! [`ironclaw_host_api::result_meta`]:
//!
//! - the failure recovery class ([`FailureKind`]) carried unchanged onto
//!   [`ToolVerdict::RecoverableFailure`], plus its structured `detail`
//!   ([`CapabilityFailureDetail`]) as a redacted [`ModelFailureDiagnostic`] on
//!   the same verdict (the model-visible correction hint): `InvalidInput` schema
//!   issues carry their [`DispatchInputIssueCode`](ironclaw_host_api::dispatch::DispatchInputIssueCode)
//!   plus redacted [`SafeSummary`] fields, and a free-text `Diagnostic` is
//!   carried as a bounded [`ModelDiagnostic`] after producer-side secret
//!   scrubbing (paths and payload delimiters remain available for recovery).
//! - `progress`/`terminate_hint`/`output_digest` →
//!   [`Outcome::progress`]/[`Outcome::terminate_hint`]/[`OutcomeRefs::output_digest`].
//! - the `resume_token` inside `approval_resume`/`auth_resume` → the
//!   [`ResumeToken`] on the gate [`GateWaypoint`]. Only the token crosses; the
//!   raw input/estimate stay host-side (the host reconstitutes them from storage
//!   keyed by the token).
//!
//! A spawned-process suspension carries only a [`ProcessRef`] (its summary has no
//! host channel). A completed result's `model_observation` rides the [`Outcome`]
//! result preview; a dependent-run child's rides the inline [`DependentRunResult`]
//! observation on the [`Suspension::DependentRun`] channel.
//!
//! ## Loop refs: minted kernel handle + preserved origin
//!
//! The loop's refs are opaque prefixed strings (`result:*`/`gate:*`/`process:*`);
//! host_api's kernel refs are opaque uuids by design, so they cannot carry the
//! loop's own ref identity. Each constructor mints a fresh kernel handle **and**
//! preserves the originating loop ref on the channel's `origin` (a [`LoopRef`]),
//! so loop/evidence state keyed under the loop ref stays reachable. The only
//! identity that crosses directly is [`TurnRunId`] → [`RunId`]
//! (both wrap a `Uuid`, preserved via `RunId::from_uuid`). Auth gate records are
//! keyed DETERMINISTICALLY from the `gate:auth-{gate_id}` ref via
//! [`GateRef::for_auth_gate`] so the persist seam and the runner's blocked-exit
//! read derive the same key (byte-stable resume).
