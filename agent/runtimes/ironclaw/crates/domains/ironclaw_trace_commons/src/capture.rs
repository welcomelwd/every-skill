//! Autonomous capture pipeline: standing-policy gate, envelope build, queue,
//! immediate flush, and the periodic queue-flush worker.
//!
//! This is the half of turn-end trace capture that is pure Trace Commons —
//! consent policy, envelope scoring/redaction, queue/hold semantics, retry
//! cadence. It is keyed on a **scope string** and this crate's own
//! [`ConversationMessage`], so it names no turn, thread, or runtime type; the
//! observer that turns a terminal turn lifecycle event into those two inputs
//! is `ironclaw_turn_runner::trace_capture` (PROPOSAL §6.10.1, WS6 — the eviction's
//! two named destinations are "`trace_commons` + the turn-runner observer
//! seam", and this is the `trace_commons` half).
//!
//! Capture must never block or fail whatever produced the turn: every entry
//! point here is infallible from the caller's perspective and logs at
//! `debug!` only (`info!`/`warn!` corrupt the REPL).
//!
//! Credit-notice delivery (v1 broadcasts via `ChannelManager`) is
//! intentionally not wired here yet: there is no outbound notification
//! surface at this tier. The notice outbox still accumulates on disk and is
//! delivered when the same scope runs under the v1 binary; a Reborn-native
//! delivery path is a follow-up.
