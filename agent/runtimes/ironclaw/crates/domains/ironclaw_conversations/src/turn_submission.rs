//! The narrow turn-submission port this crate needs from the host.
//!
//! `ironclaw_conversations` owns the inbound orchestration — accepted-message
//! idempotency, binding resolution, replay, submit-key rotation — but it must
//! not depend on the turn kernel (`ironclaw_turns`) to run it. The orchestration
//! touches the coordinator at exactly **one** call site (`submit_turn`, inside
//! `submit_or_replay`), so that call site is declared here as a one-method port
//! and implemented above by `ironclaw_composition` over the
//! `TurnCoordinator` handle it already constructs. Dependency inversion:
//! declared below, implemented above (`.claude/rules/type-placement.md` §2).
//!
//! Everything the port speaks is either `ironclaw_host_api::turn` vocabulary or
//! declared here. Nothing in this module names the kernel.
