//! Kept as the enforcement point for epic #6941 criterion 7. The scorer changes this lint
//! shipped alongside in #6937 were closed as the wrong change -- the scorer decides nothing
//! once selection is `ExplicitOnly` -- but the lint itself became MORE relevant, not less:
//! under model-decided selection the description is the model's only signal in the listing, so
//! a generic or over-long one degrades routing for every later request.
