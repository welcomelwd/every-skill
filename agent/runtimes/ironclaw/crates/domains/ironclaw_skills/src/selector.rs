/// its own companions, to keep the behavior predictable.

/// respect `max_candidates`. If the remaining budget can't fit a
/// companion, it is silently skipped with a debug log — the parent is
/// still selected. Companions with a satisfied `setup_marker` are

/// exist for one-time setup skills. Any skill whose
/// `activation.setup_marker` is in this set is excluded from candidates
/// regardless of score — its setup has already been completed and there's
/// nothing for it to do. The caller (`agent_loop::select_active_skills`)
/// is responsible for computing this set by checking the workspace for
