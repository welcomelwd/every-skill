# Agent Map — ironclaw_skills

## Start Here

- This file is the canonical crate-local rules; orientation, measured
  surface/deps, and test commands are in [`README.md`](./README.md), and the
  family boundary is [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
- Read `Cargo.toml` for actual dependencies and feature shape.
- Use these sources of truth before changing behavior:
- `.claude/rules/skills.md`
- `docs/internal/reborn/contracts/extensions.md`

## What This Crate Owns

- Skill metadata parsing (`parser`), validation (`validation`), deterministic scoring/selection (`selector`), filesystem management and its mount-scoped port (`management`, `scoped_management`), installed-skill records (`install_metadata`), pure learning distillation/refinement logic (`learning`), and the skill type definitions (`types`).
- Crate-local public API, tests, and fixtures needed to prove that ownership.

> ✎ **Corrected 2026-08-04 (WS6 domain-internal cleanups).** This section previously
> claimed modules `gating`, `registry` and `catalog`, and a `v2` module exporting
> `V2SkillMetadata` / `CodeSnippet` / `SkillMetrics` / `SkillRevision` /
> `SkillRepairRecord` "serialized into `MemoryDoc.metadata` by the engine crate".
> **None of those modules or symbols exists** — `rg` over `crates/` matched only
> this file — and `ironclaw_engine` was deleted. The module list above is the real
> `src/` contents.

## Do Not Move In Here

- Concrete prompt execution, LLM/runtime adapters, tool authorization, extension runtime dispatch, credential handling, channel UI, or ClawHub server behavior.
- Compatibility shims for unsupported legacy skill metadata unless the parser contract explicitly changes.
- Secrets, raw host paths, backend error details, and unredacted user content in errors, events, snapshots, logs, or docs.

## Validation

- Fast local check: `cargo test -p ironclaw_skills`
- Feature-shape check after catalog/registry changes: `cargo test -p ironclaw_skills --all-features`
- Boundary check after dependency/API changes: `cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests`

## Agent Notes

- Skill selection must stay deterministic: no ambient time, network, or filesystem effects in scoring.
- Skill learning must stay pure: `learning` owns prompts, parsing, and the `SkillInferencePort` abstraction only; composition owns concrete inference adapters, scoped writes, and notifications.
- Installed skills are lower-trust than user/workspace skills. What that trust gates is **content exposure** (prompt body vs. safe description only), decided by `ironclaw_loop_contracts::skill_context::SkillTrustLevel` — not tool access, which `ironclaw_authorization` / `ironclaw_capabilities` own. Preserve the `Installed < Trusted` ordering `SkillTrust` derives.
- Add caller-level tests when parser or selection changes affect prompt assembly or skill-content exposure.
