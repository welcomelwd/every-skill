//! First-class Project domain contracts for IronClaw Reborn.
//!
//! This module owns the Project entity, project membership / access-control
//! records, and the [`ProjectRepository`] persistence contract. The single
//! implementation, [`FilesystemProjectRepository`], persists records over the
//! Reborn `ScopedFilesystem` substrate, so backend selection (Postgres / libSQL
//! / JSONL / in-memory) is the host's `RootFilesystem` concern — there is no
//! SQL here.
//!
//! Projects scope threads, automations, and workspace memory. In the Reborn
//! stack a `project_id` already flows through `ThreadScope`,
//! `ProductAgentBoundCaller`, and `TriggerRecord` as a scope identifier; this
//! module gives that identifier a durable, access-controlled entity.
//!
//! Authorization is **live** — [`ProjectRepository::resolve_access`] is called
//! per request and never cached, so revoking a grant takes effect immediately.
//! `tests/project_repository_contract.rs` drives that property through the
//! public seam in both directions (a revoke and a re-grant are each visible on
//! the very next call).
//!
//! # Why it lives in `ironclaw_identity`
//!
//! Merged here from the former standalone `ironclaw_projects` crate (PROPOSAL
//! §6.4.11 / §12.10, decided 2026-07-30). It is a principal-scoped access
//! record with a dependency set identical to identity's pinned allowlist
//! (`{ironclaw_host_api, ironclaw_filesystem}`), riding the same control-plane
//! substrate as [`RebornIdentityStore`](crate::RebornIdentityStore) — nothing
//! distinguished it as its own compilation or trust unit.
//!
//! The authorization-gating half followed on 2026-08-05:
//! [`RebornProjectService`] in [`service`] implements
//! `ironclaw_product_contracts::project_service::ProjectService` over the
//! repository below it. It could not travel with the records because the port
//! was a `products`-layer declaration; §12.13 D-P hoisted the port into
//! `ironclaw_product_contracts` and D-Q widened this crate's armed allowlist to
//! `{ironclaw_host_api, ironclaw_filesystem, ironclaw_product_contracts}` so
//! the adapter could name it.
//!
//! Still **not** here, and neither is blocked on this crate: the project-create
//! capability (`ironclaw_assistant::project_create_capability`, which names
//! `ironclaw_loop_host` — a `loops` crate no `substrates` crate may hold) and
//! the multi-mount browse reader (`ironclaw_composition`, which names product
//! helpers and composition-owned mount aliases). See §6.10.1.
