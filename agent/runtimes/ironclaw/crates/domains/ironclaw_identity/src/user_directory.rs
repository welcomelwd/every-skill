//! Admin-facing user directory: enumeration and lifecycle over the canonical
//! [`StoredUser`](crate::identity_store) records this crate already persists.
//!
//! This is a **separate trait** from [`RebornIdentityResolver`](crate::RebornIdentityResolver)
//! on purpose. The resolver owns the security-load-bearing mint/link/create
//! contract (verified-email linking, channel-actor fail-closed); the directory
//! owns the CRUD an operator performs against those records. Keeping them apart
//! means the admin surface cannot accidentally reach into the resolution
//! invariants, and the resolver's contract tests are not perturbed by admin
//! methods.
//!
//! Both traits are implemented by the one
//! [`RebornIdentityStore`](crate::RebornIdentityStore), so
//! the composition root gets both surfaces from a single `Arc`.
