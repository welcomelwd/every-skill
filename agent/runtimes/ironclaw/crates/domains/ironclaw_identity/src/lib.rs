//! Canonical Reborn **principal** identity layer.
//!
//! The boundary that maps an external identity to a stable Reborn [`UserId`]
//! *before* any runtime state (conversation binding, thread ownership) is
//! touched, and the only path in the stack that **mints** a user.
//!
//! - Identity provisioning lives HERE, not in WebUI ingress and not in
//!   `ironclaw_conversations` (which stays lookup/binding-oriented and
//!   consumes an already-resolved `UserId`).
//! - WebUI OAuth feeds normalized [`ResolveExternalIdentity`] values into
//!   [`RebornIdentityResolver`].
//! - **Channel actors are not bound here.** `SurfaceKind::ChannelActor` is
//!   rejected on `resolve_or_create` ([`RebornIdentityError::ChannelActorNotMintable`])
//!   and this crate offers no binding path of its own: post-OAuth channel
//!   binding belongs to `ironclaw_extension_host`'s channel identity store,
//!   behind the `ironclaw_host_api::user_identity` ports. The two stores and
//!   the line between them are specified in `CONTRACT.md`, "Two
//!   external-identity stores". `ExternalIdentityKey` and
//!   `RebornIdentityResolver::{lookup, bind}` were retired in #5618 — they
//!   had no production caller and the key was not even constructible
//!   downstream.
//!
//! The external identity is keyed by `(tenant_id, surface_kind,
//! provider_kind, provider_instance_id, external_subject_id)` so two
//! tenants, two adapter installations, or two surfaces cannot collide on
//! the same subject id. Verified email may link OAuth providers within a
//! tenant; an unverified email never links.
//!
//! Persistence ([`RebornIdentityStore`]) goes through the host
//! [`RootFilesystem`](ironclaw_filesystem::RootFilesystem) /
//! `ScopedFilesystem` abstraction — the same substrate boundary every other
//! durable Reborn store sits behind — so substrate choice, tenant scoping,
//! and host ownership stay centralized in the filesystem layer rather than
//! this crate holding a raw database handle.
//!
//! # The [`projects`] module
//!
//! The crate's second principal-scoped record family: the Project entity, its
//! membership ACL, and the `ProjectRepository` contract, merged in from the
//! former standalone `ironclaw_projects` crate (PROPOSAL §6.4.11 / §12.10,
//! decided 2026-07-30). It rides the same control-plane `ScopedFilesystem`
//! mount and names the same two workspace crates this one is pinned to, so it
//! adds no dependency and no new layer reach; see the module doc for what
//! deliberately stayed in `ironclaw_assistant`.
