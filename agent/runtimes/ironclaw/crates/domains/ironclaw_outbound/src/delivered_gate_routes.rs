//! Delivered-gate route records for cross-thread approval routing.
//!
//! When a triggered run is blocked on approval and the approval prompt is
//! delivered to the creator's personal target (e.g., a Slack DM), the DM
//! thread is different from the run's original thread. When the user replies
//! with `approve <gate_ref>` in their DM, the inbound path resolves the scope
//! from the DM conversation rather than the run's thread — causing a
//! `MissingGate` error in the approval service.
//!
//! This module stores a lightweight routing record that maps
//! `(tenant_id, user_id, gate_ref)` → `(run_id, scope)`. The composition
//! layer records this mapping when an approval prompt is delivered, and a
//! routing wrapper around the `ApprovalInteractionService` rewrites the
//! incoming resolve request to use the stored scope before forwarding to the
//! inner service.
//!
//! ## Record lifetime
//!
//! Route records expire after [`DELIVERED_GATE_ROUTE_TTL`]. Expired records
//! are ignored on load (treated as a miss) and removed lazily by the routing
//! wrapper. An opportunistic sweep runs when a new route is recorded (on
//! approval-prompt delivery) via [`DeliveredGateRouteStore::sweep_expired_delivered_gate_routes`].
//!
//! Design constraints:
//! - Channel-neutral: no Slack, WebUI, or other channel-specific words.
//! - Best-effort writes: callers must swallow store errors and never abort
//!   delivery on write failure.
//! - Security: the lookup key binds tenant + user; the wrapper also verifies
//!   that the requesting actor matches the record owner before rewriting.
//! - Personal scope only: route records are only written for personal-scope
//!   triggers (the driver already fails closed to personal-only).
