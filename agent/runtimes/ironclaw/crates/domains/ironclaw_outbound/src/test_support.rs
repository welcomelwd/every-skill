//! In-memory-backed outbound-state store constructor for tests.
//!
//! The Reborn architecture-simplification note
//! (`docs/internal/reborn/contracts/storage-placement.md`)
//! replaces hand-written `InMemory*Store` parallel implementations with the one
//! production `Filesystem*Store<F>` exercised over an in-memory backend:
//! "in-memory" stops being a store and becomes a filesystem backend
//! (`InMemoryBackend`). This helper wires that seam for the outbound-state store
//! — a `ScopedFilesystem<InMemoryBackend>` mounting `/outbound` (the alias the
//! store persists all four role subtrees under: `policies/`, `subscriptions/`,
//! `deliveries/`, `communication-preferences/`, `delivered-gate-routes/`) — so
//! tests instantiate the same store a deployment runs.
//!
//! Note on isolation: [`OutboundStateStore`] encodes the record scope
//! (thread-scope key, hashed communication-preference key, subscription/delivery
//! key) in the path, and tenant/user isolation lives in the `MountView`. The
//! single fixed mount below therefore isolates by those in-path scope keys but
//! not by tenant/user — which matches the single-tenant test doubles the deleted
//! `InMemoryOutboundStateStore` served. Cross-tenant isolation is exercised by
//! the per-tenant-mount tests in `tests/outbound_state_store_contract.rs`.
//!
//! Unlike the deleted `InMemoryOutboundStateStore` (which implemented only
//! `CommunicationPreferenceRepository` + `OutboundStateStorePort`),
//! `OutboundStateStore` implements all four outbound-store traits, so
//! a single instance from this helper can back every role — the same
//! consolidation the durable (libsql/postgres) composition already relies on.
//!
//! Gated behind `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))]` so nothing here
//! ships in production binaries; downstream crates enable the `test-support`
//! feature from their `[dev-dependencies]`.
