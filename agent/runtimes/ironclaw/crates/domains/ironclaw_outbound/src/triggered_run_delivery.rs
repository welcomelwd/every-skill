//! Delivery outcome records for trigger-fired runs.
//!
//! When a trigger fires and submits a run, the notifier watches it and fans
//! out the notices it produces — an approval gate, an expired credential, a
//! failure — to the creator's configured **notification channels**. It does
//! NOT push the run's result: a fire's answer lives in its own run thread,
//! and putting it on a channel is the model's explicit
//! `builtin.outbound_deliver` call. This module holds the outcome record for
//! that watch-and-notify pass, and its in-memory store.
//!
//! Design constraints:
//! - Resolution-stage failures (e.g. no notification channels configured) must
//!   NOT produce delivery-attempt rows — those rows are for attempts that reach
//!   the transport layer. Instead we write a lightweight outcome record here.
//! - Authoritative terminal state: owners propagate record failures into their
//!   managed task lifecycle instead of reporting an unpersisted completion.
//! - Personal scope only: non-personal triggers fail closed with `Denied`.
