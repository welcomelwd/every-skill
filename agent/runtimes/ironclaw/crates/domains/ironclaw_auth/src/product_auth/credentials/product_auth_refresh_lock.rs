//! Deployment-wide leader-lock for the engine-owned credential keepalive
//! sweep (`crate::keepalive`).
//!
//! # Leader-lock model
//!
//! Only ONE process per deployment should sweep credential accounts and
//! refresh idle tokens per tick. This module provides the composition-side
//! [`crate::KeepaliveLeaderLock`] implementation the sweep uses to
//! elect a single leader per tick:
//!
//! - **Postgres path**: the sweep calls [`CredentialRefreshLeaderLock::run_as_leader`]
//!   each tick. That call opens a transaction and tries
//!   `pg_try_advisory_xact_lock` using a single fixed deployment-wide key. If
//!   the lock is already held by another process, the current process is not the
//!   leader — it skips the sweep and returns [`LeaderOutcome::NotLeader`]. If the
//!   lock is acquired, the sweep runs inside the transaction, which is then
//!   committed (releasing the lock) and [`LeaderOutcome::Ran`] is returned. A
//!   single connection is held only for the duration of the sweep; because the
//!   sweep ticks at ~6 h the connection cost is negligible.
//!
//!   The lock is **transaction-level**, not session-level, on purpose: a
//!   transaction-level advisory lock is released automatically when the
//!   transaction ends for any reason — commit, rollback, panic, or the future
//!   being dropped on shutdown/cancellation. This is cancellation-safe: an
//!   aborted sweep can never strand the lock on a pooled connection and block
//!   all future leader elections.
//! - **libsql / single-process path** (`pool = None`): this process is
//!   trivially the only process, so the sweep always runs. No connection is
//!   held.
//!
//! The sweep itself — recipe-threshold selection, refresh, scheduling — is
//! engine-owned (`crate::keepalive`); composition contributes only
//! this deployment-topology-aware election.
//!
//! # Two-layer concurrency ownership
//!
//! - **Cross-process** (this module): one leader per deployment tick; all
//!   other processes skip.
//! - **Intra-process** (in [`crate::ProviderBackedCredentialAccountService`]):
//!   the existing `refresh_locks: Mutex<HashMap<CredentialAccountId, …>>` prevents
//!   multiple tokio tasks inside one process from racing to the token endpoint.
//!   That guard is retained and is NOT removed.
//!
//! The inline dispatch path (hot path) is **unaffected** by this module: it
//! uses only the in-process `refresh_locks` guard and never acquires a DB
//! connection.
//!
//! # Advisory lock key
//!
//! Postgres advisory locks live in ONE global 64-bit namespace shared by all
//! connections in the cluster. The key is two `i32` values (`(key1, key2)`)
//! that together form a 64-bit slot. We use two fixed literal constants chosen
//! to be statistically unlikely to alias with other advisory-lock users in the
//! same cluster (hooks predicate, etc.). This is the same approach as
//! `ironclaw_hooks_postgres` — collision avoidance by statistical improbability,
//! not structural isolation.
//!
//! # Pool / connection error fallback
//!
//! If the pool returns a connection error, or `pg_try_advisory_lock` itself
//! fails, the worker logs at `debug!` and skips the tick entirely
//! (fail-closed). Keepalive is best-effort: missing one tick is harmless
//! because the worker retries on the next scheduled interval. The in-process
//! guard inside `ProviderBackedCredentialAccountService` still prevents local
//! stampede if connectivity recovers mid-tick.
