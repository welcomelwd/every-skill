//! The caller's per-channel connection surface.
//!
//! **Why here.** [`ChannelAuthAccountState`] is literally the argument pair of
//! [`crate::project_auth_account_state`] — two of this crate's own §6.3 enums —
//! and [`ChannelConnectionService`] is the port that produces it. The port's
//! only other vocabulary is `ironclaw_product_contracts::surface`, which this
//! crate may name (a `substrates -> contracts` edge, the same downward shape
//! `ironclaw_attachments` already carries for its landing ports).
//!
//! The projection decision does **not** cross the port: `project_auth_account_state`
//! stays a pure function of the two enums and is called by `ironclaw_assistant`'s
//! extensions wire, so nothing authoritative moves with the vocabulary.
