## Sub-owner map

The File Map above says what each file *is*. This map says who **owns** it —
which of the crate's ten concerns a change belongs to, and what must not drift
into it. PROPOSAL §6.4.13 asks for this map and names five sub-owners
(providers / auth-sessions / registry / decorators / recording); measured
against the tree those five cover 28 of 48 files, so five more are named here
to reach 100%. See the amendment on §6.4.13 for why each addition is not one
of the original five.

**This table is enforced.** `tests/module_charter.rs` asserts every `.rs` file
under `src/` appears in exactly one row and every path in a row exists, so the
map cannot rot in either direction — a new file fails until it is given an
owner, and a deleted one fails until its entry goes.

| Sub-owner | Owns | Never contains | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core-contract` | The `LlmProvider` trait, the request/response vocabulary, the error taxonomy, the config types, shared HTTP hardening, and the factory that assembles everything | A vendor protocol, or reliability behavior | `lib.rs`, `provider.rs`, `error.rs`, `config.rs`, `url_check.rs` |
| `providers` | One concrete `LlmProvider` per vendor and the protocol shims used by that vendor alone | Cross-provider normalization (that is `normalization`), or credential lifecycle (that is `auth-sessions`) | `nearai_chat.rs`, `rig_adapter.rs`, `gemini_oauth.rs`, `codex_chatgpt.rs`, `bedrock.rs`, `openai_codex_provider.rs`, `anthropic_oauth.rs`, `github_copilot.rs`, `nearai_tool_message_flattening.rs`, `responses_reasoning.rs`, `anthropic_thinking.rs` |
| `auth-sessions` | Acquiring, persisting, refreshing and revoking provider credentials, plus the host seam that stores them | Request/response shaping | `auth.rs`, `session.rs`, `openai_codex_session.rs`, `github_copilot_auth.rs`, `codex_auth.rs`, `token_refreshing.rs`, `host.rs` |
| `registry` | The **provider** catalog: definitions, protocols, base-URL and api-key resolution | Model facts (that is `model-catalog`) | `registry.rs`, `resolution.rs` |
| `decorators` | Anything that wraps `dyn LlmProvider` and is not credential work: retry, breaker, failover, cache, hot-reload, cost routing | Vendor protocol | `retry.rs`, `circuit_breaker.rs`, `failover.rs`, `response_cache.rs`, `runtime.rs`, `smart_routing.rs` |
| `normalization` | Cross-provider wire hygiene in all three directions: outbound tool schemas, inbound tool arguments, inbound content text | A fix that only one provider needs — that belongs beside it in `providers` | `tool_schema.rs`, `tool_schema/placeholder_stripping.rs`, `tool_args.rs`, `reasoning.rs` |
| `model-catalog` | Facts about **models**: what an endpoint lists, and which models see images, generate images, or think natively | Provider identity or routing | `models.rs`, `reasoning_models.rs`, `vision_models.rs`, `image_models.rs` |
| `recording` | Trace capture and replay, and binding recorded tool arguments to earlier results | Live provider behavior | `recording.rs`, `trace_binding.rs` |
| `transcription` | The `TranscriptionProvider` trait and its implementations — a **different trait** from `LlmProvider`, sharing only transports | Anything implementing `LlmProvider` | `transcription/mod.rs`, `transcription/chat_completions.rs`, `transcription/openai.rs` |
| `test-support` | Fixtures and fault injection, including the published `test-support` feature downstream harnesses consume | Production behavior | `testing/mod.rs`, `testing/fault_injection.rs`, `codex_test_helpers.rs`, `rig_adapter/tests/finish_reason_tests.rs`, `anthropic_oauth/tests.rs` |

Four placement calls worth stating, because each is a file whose *shape*
suggests one owner and whose *purpose* is another:

- **`token_refreshing.rs` is `auth-sessions`, not `decorators`.** It is a
  decorator by construction, but its whole body is pre-emptive OAuth refresh
  and retry-once-on-`AuthFailed`; nothing in it is reliability. (The File Map
  above calls it a decorator; `AGENTS.md` files it under auth. This is the
  ruling.)
- **`runtime.rs` and `smart_routing.rs` are `decorators`** even though neither
  is a *reliability* wrapper — which is why this table's definition is "wraps
  `dyn LlmProvider` and is not credential work" rather than the narrower
  "retry/breaker/failover/cache".
- **`url_check.rs` is `core-contract`** on the strength of `build_http_client`
  being shared egress plumbing. Its SSRF policy (`check_models_url`) is
  security-relevant and has three in-crate consumers; if it ever grows a second
  concern it should become its own sub-owner rather than be split.
- **`gemini_oauth.rs` is the one genuinely two-owner file.** Its
  `CredentialManager`/`OAuthCredential` half is `auth-sessions` and its
  `GeminiOauthProvider` half is `providers`. A file-granular map has to pick
  one, so it is charged to `providers` (the larger half). Splitting it is owed
  work, not a defect in this map.

## Provider Selection

Set via `LLM_BACKEND` env var:

| Value | Provider | Key env vars |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `nearai` (default) | NEAR AI Chat Completions | `NEARAI_SESSION_TOKEN` or `NEARAI_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `github_copilot` | GitHub Copilot Chat API | `GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_COPILOT_MODEL` |
| `ollama` | Ollama local | `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` |
| `openai_compatible` | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint | `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL` |
| `tinfoil` | Tinfoil TEE inference | `TINFOIL_API_KEY`, `TINFOIL_MODEL` |
| `bedrock` | AWS Bedrock (requires `--features bedrock`) | `BEDROCK_REGION`, `BEDROCK_MODEL`, `AWS_PROFILE` |
| `openai_codex` | OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT subscription) | `OPENAI_CODEX_MODEL`, `OPENAI_CODEX_CLIENT_ID` |

Codex auth reuse:
- Set `LLM_USE_CODEX_AUTH=true` to load credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json` (override with `CODEX_AUTH_PATH`).
- If Codex is logged in with API-key mode, IronClaw uses the standard OpenAI endpoint.
- If Codex is logged in with ChatGPT OAuth mode, IronClaw routes to the private `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex` Responses API via `codex_chatgpt.rs`.
- ChatGPT mode supports one automatic 401 refresh using the refresh token persisted in `auth.json`.
- In ChatGPT mode the `/models` list is gated by the reported Codex `client_version`. It is auto-detected from the installed `codex` binary (`codex --version`), falling back to a bundled default. A stale value silently hides newer models (e.g. `gpt-5.5`) the account is entitled to.

## AWS Bedrock Provider

Uses the native Converse API via `aws-sdk-bedrockruntime` (`bedrock.rs`). Requires `--features bedrock` at build time — not in default features due to heavy AWS SDK dependencies.

**Auth:** Standard AWS credential chain — IAM credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), SSO profiles (`AWS_PROFILE`), or instance roles. The SDK resolves auth automatically from the environment.

**Config:**
- `BEDROCK_REGION` — AWS region (default: `us-east-1`)
- `BEDROCK_MODEL` — Required model ID (e.g., `anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`)
- `BEDROCK_CROSS_REGION` — Optional cross-region inference prefix (`us`, `eu`, `apac`, `global`)

## GitHub Copilot Provider Notes

`github_copilot` uses a dedicated `GithubCopilotProvider` (`github_copilot.rs`) with
direct HTTP via `reqwest::Client`. It cannot use `RigAdapter` because the Copilot API
requires a two-step authentication flow: a long-lived GitHub OAuth token is exchanged
for a short-lived Copilot session token via `api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token`.
The session token is cached and auto-refreshed before expiry by `CopilotTokenManager`
in `github_copilot_auth.rs`.

The API endpoint is `https://api.githubcopilot.com/chat/completions` (OpenAI Chat
Completions format). Token source: `GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN` env var, or the
`oauth_token` from your IDE sign-in flow (`~/.config/github-copilot/apps.json`).
The setup wizard supports GitHub device login or manual token paste.

**Known risk:** The device login flow uses the VS Code Copilot OAuth client ID
(`Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98`) and injects VS Code identity headers (`User-Agent`,
`Editor-Version`, `Editor-Plugin-Version`, `Copilot-Integration-Id`). GitHub could
rotate this client ID at any time. If GitHub publishes an official third-party client
ID, migrate to it immediately. Advanced users can override headers via
`GITHUB_COPILOT_EXTRA_HEADERS`.

## NEAR AI Provider Gotchas

**Dual auth modes:**
- **Session token** (default): `NEARAI_SESSION_TOKEN=sess_...`, base URL = `https://private.near.ai`. Tokens are persisted to `~/.ironclaw/session.json` (mode 0600) and optionally to the DB `settings` table (`nearai.session_token`). On 401 responses where the body contains "session" + "expired"/"invalid", `NearAiChatProvider` calls `session.handle_auth_failure()` which triggers the interactive OAuth login flow and retries once. Plain `AuthFailed` 401s are not retried.
- **API key**: Set `NEARAI_API_KEY` (from `cloud.near.ai`), base URL defaults to `https://cloud-api.near.ai`. 401s with API key auth are immediately returned as `LlmError::AuthFailed` — no renewal.

**Session renewal is interactive:** When `SessionExpired` triggers renewal, it blocks and prompts the user in the terminal (GitHub/Google OAuth or manual API key entry). This is unsuitable for headless/hosted deployments — set `NEARAI_SESSION_TOKEN` env var instead.

**Tool message flattening:** Current NEAR AI cloud-api deployments support standard Chat Completions tool history, including assistant `tool_calls` followed by `role: "tool"` results. `nearai_chat.rs` therefore defaults `flatten_tool_messages = false`. The legacy compatibility rewrite remains opt-in via `NearAiChatProvider::new_with_options(..., true, ...)` for old OpenAI-compatible deployments that reject tool-role messages. That rewrite drops assistant messages that only carry provider tool-call protocol and turns tool results into user-side observations using the shared `ironclaw_common::provider_transcript` grammar (`Tool result from <name>: <content>`), which should not be used on compliant endpoints.

**Tool schema normalization:** `nearai_chat.rs` uses the provider-safe `FlattenOnly` policy from `tool_schema.rs`: it still flattens top-level `oneOf`/`anyOf`/`allOf`/`enum`/`not` schemas that OpenAI-compatible tool APIs reject, but it does not rewrite optional object fields into required-nullable strict mode. `RigAdapter::convert_tools` and `openai_codex_provider.rs` continue to use the stricter OpenAI policy.

**Pricing auto-fetch:** On startup, `NearAiChatProvider` fires a background task to fetch per-model pricing from `/v1/model/list`. If the fetch fails, it silently falls back to `costs::model_cost()` / `costs::default_cost()`. Pricing is stored in-memory only.

**HTTP request timeout:** Non-streaming NEAR AI requests have a 60-second total timeout (`DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` in `config.rs`). Streaming requests use the same value for time-to-response-headers and each inter-event idle gap, but have no total wall-clock timeout; active long answers must not be cancelled merely because they exceed 60 seconds. The 10 s connect timeout and 30 s TCP keepalive from the shared hardened client also apply (see "Shared client timeout hygiene" below). Rate limit `Retry-After` headers are parsed (both delay-seconds and HTTP-date formats) and forwarded as `LlmError::RateLimited { retry_after }` for the `RetryProvider` to honor.

**Interrupted streams:** A streamed response is complete only after an SSE `[DONE]` marker or an explicit provider finish reason. EOF, transport failure, or an idle timeout before either terminal signal is `LlmError::StreamInterrupted` even when partial text was received. Never reinterpret a partial response as success or issue a semantic continuation request: the runtime must receive the real failure, and only the original provider stream can preserve exact output and tool-call semantics. Completed malformed or empty responses use `InvalidResponse` / `EmptyResponse`; those are invalid model output, not provider availability.

**Shared client timeout hygiene:** Every production reqwest client in this crate starts from the shared hardened builders in `config.rs`, the single source of truth for connect-timeout (`CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECS` = 10 s), TCP keepalive (`TCP_KEEPALIVE_SECS` = 30 s), and idle-pool bound (`POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECS` = 90 s). One-shot requests additionally use `hardened_client_builder(request_timeout_secs)` for a total timeout; streaming responses use `hardened_streaming_client_builder()` and apply header/idle bounds while consuming the stream. Callers chain site-specific options (`.redirect`, `.resolve_to_addrs`, `.default_headers`) onto the returned builder. Do not re-apply these settings inline — change them only in `config.rs`. Exception: the few infallible constructors that cannot return an error (`SessionManager::new_async`, the transcription providers in `transcription/openai.rs` and `transcription/chat_completions.rs`) build via the hardened builder but log a `tracing::error!` and degrade to a bare `Client::new()` on the rare `.build()` failure (e.g. TLS-backend init) rather than failing construction; making the hardened client the only constructable path in these sites is tracked as durable enforcement in issue #5214.

## Circuit Breaker

State machine in `circuit_breaker.rs`:
```
Closed (normal)
  → Open (after failure_threshold consecutive transient failures; default: 5)
    → HalfOpen (after recovery_timeout; default: 30s)
      → Closed (after half_open_successes_needed probe successes; default: 2)
      → Open (if any probe fails)
```

**Transient vs non-transient errors:** `RequestFailed`, `RateLimited`, `BadGateway`, `StreamInterrupted`, `SessionExpired`, and `SessionRenewalFailed` count toward the threshold. `Http` and `Io` count only when their concrete status/error kind carries transient connection evidence. `InvalidResponse`, `EmptyResponse`, `AuthFailed`, `ContextLengthExceeded`, `ModelNotAvailable`, `QuotaExceeded`, and `Json` never trip the breaker.

Configure via `LlmConfig` fields: `circuit_breaker_threshold` (env: `LLM_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`, falls back to `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`; None = disabled), `circuit_breaker_recovery_secs` (env: `LLM_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_SECS`; default: 30).

The circuit breaker wraps the retry/routing/failover chain (`apply_decorator_chain` applies `CircuitBreakerProvider` after `FailoverProvider`, so the breaker sits outside failover — see the assembly order below). When open, it immediately returns `LlmError::RequestFailed` with a message including remaining cooldown seconds; nothing beneath it runs, including the failover fallback, until the recovery window elapses and a half-open probe is admitted.

## Failover Chain

`FailoverProvider` in `failover.rs` wraps a list of `LlmProvider` instances. On a retryable error, it tries the next provider in the list. Providers that fail repeatedly enter a cooldown period and are skipped (unless all providers are in cooldown, in which case the least-recently-cooled one is tried).

**Cooldown defaults:** `failure_threshold = 3` consecutive retryable failures → cooldown for `cooldown_duration = 300s`. Configure via `NearAiConfig` fields: `failover_cooldown_secs`, `failover_cooldown_threshold`.

**Current wiring:** The failover is set up between primary model and `NEARAI_FALLBACK_MODEL` (a different model name on the same NEAR AI backend), not across different LLM provider types. Cross-provider failover (e.g., NEAR AI → Anthropic) requires manual construction.

## Retry

`RetryProvider` in `retry.rs` wraps any `LlmProvider` with exponential backoff. Retries on: `RequestFailed`, `RateLimited`, `BadGateway`, `StreamInterrupted`, `SessionRenewalFailed`, plus `Http` / `Io` only with concrete transient evidence. Does **not** retry completed `InvalidResponse` / `EmptyResponse`, `AuthFailed`, `SessionExpired`, `ContextLengthExceeded`, `ModelNotAvailable`, `QuotaExceeded`, or `Json`.

**Backoff schedule:** base 1s doubled per attempt with ±25% jitter, minimum floor 100ms. Attempt 0: ~1s, attempt 1: ~2s, attempt 2: ~4s. For `RateLimited`, uses the `retry_after` duration from the error (provider-supplied) instead of backoff.

Configure via `LlmConfig.max_retries` (env: `LLM_MAX_RETRIES`, falls back to `NEARAI_MAX_RETRIES`; default: 3). Set to 0 to disable.

## LlmProvider Trait

The full trait (all methods must be implemented or rely on defaults):

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait LlmProvider: Send + Sync {
    // Required
    fn model_name(&self) -> &str;
    fn cost_per_token(&self) -> (Decimal, Decimal);  // (input, output) per token
    async fn complete(&self, request: CompletionRequest) -> Result<CompletionResponse, LlmError>;
    async fn complete_with_tools(&self, request: ToolCompletionRequest) -> Result<ToolCompletionResponse, LlmError>;

    // Optional (have defaults)
    async fn list_models(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>, LlmError> { Ok(vec![]) }
    async fn model_metadata(&self) -> Result<ModelMetadata, LlmError> { /* name only */ }
    fn effective_model_name(&self, requested_model: Option<&str>) -> String { /* uses active */ }
    fn active_model_name(&self) -> String { self.model_name().to_string() }
    fn set_model(&self, _model: &str) -> Result<(), LlmError> { /* Err: not supported */ }
    fn calculate_cost(&self, input_tokens: u32, output_tokens: u32) -> Decimal { /* uses cost_per_token */ }
}
```

Key notes:
- `model_name()` returns the configured model name; `active_model_name()` returns the currently active model (may differ if `set_model()` was called — only `NearAiChatProvider` supports this).
- `cost_per_token()` returns `(Decimal, Decimal)` using `rust_decimal`. Look up via `costs::model_cost()` in your constructor; fall back to `costs::default_cost()` for unknowns.
- `RigAdapter` forwards per-request model overrides through rig-core's typed request model field. Do not put `model` in flattened `additional_params`, which would serialize a duplicate top-level JSON key.
- `complete_with_tools()` is never cached (tool calls can have side effects) — `CachedProvider` always passes them through.

To add a new provider:
1. Create `crates/domains/ironclaw_llm/src/myprovider.rs` implementing `LlmProvider` <!-- check-guidance: path-ok --> (prescriptive: the file you are about to add, not one that exists)
2. Add a `ProviderProtocol` variant in `registry.rs` (or wire a backend-string match in `lib.rs` for non-registry providers like `nearai`/`bedrock`/`openai_codex`)
3. Wire into the factory dispatch in `lib.rs` (`create_registry_provider` for registry-backed protocols, top-level `create_llm_provider` for backend-string-keyed providers)
4. Add env vars to `.env.example` and to whichever crate reads them (✎ the v1 `src/config/llm.rs` is gone — deleted with the monolith)
5. If the provider needs persistent state (session tokens, refresh tokens, etc.), use the host traits in `host.rs` — never reach for `crate::db`, `crate::secrets`, or `crate::bootstrap`. The crate must stay independent of the binary; the binary supplies the adapter impls.

## Host Trait Surface

`host.rs` defines four traits that decouple `ironclaw_llm` from the binary:

| Trait | Purpose | Binary adapter |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `SessionDb` | JSON settings persistence | none today |
| `SessionSecrets` | Encrypted secrets store | none today |
| `SessionRenewer` | Interactive NEAR-AI re-auth flow | only `NoopSessionRenewer` (`src/host.rs`) |
| `SessionKeyPersistor` | Runtime env overlay + `.env` upsert | only `NoopKeyPersistor` (`src/host.rs`) |

The v1 adapter names this table used to cite (`DatabaseSessionDb`,
`SecretsStoreSessionSecrets`, `BootstrapKeyPersistor`, ✎ `src/llm_host.rs`,
✎ `src/setup/`) went with the monolith and resolve to nothing today — and no
Reborn binary has supplied replacements yet. Re-derive the real implementor set
with `rg -n "impl (SessionDb|SessionSecrets|SessionRenewer|SessionKeyPersistor) for" crates/`
before assuming any of these ports is wired.

`NoopSessionRenewer` and `NoopKeyPersistor` are provided for headless / hosted contexts (return errors / no-ops) and are the only implementations in the tree today. A binary that needs real behavior plugs concrete impls into `SessionManager` at startup; no Reborn binary currently does.

## Response Cache

`CachedProvider` in `response_cache.rs` caches `complete()` responses. `complete_with_tools()` is never cached (side effects). Cache key is SHA-256 of `(model_name, messages_json, max_tokens, temperature, stop_sequences)`. LRU eviction when `max_entries` is reached; TTL-based expiry on access.

**Defaults:** TTL = 1 hour, max entries = 1000. Configure via `LlmConfig` fields: `response_cache_enabled` (env: `LLM_RESPONSE_CACHE_ENABLED`, falls back to `RESPONSE_CACHE_ENABLED`), `response_cache_ttl_secs` (env: `LLM_RESPONSE_CACHE_TTL_SECS`), `response_cache_max_entries` (env: `LLM_RESPONSE_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES`). Cache is in-memory only — evicted on restart.

## OpenAI-Compatible Custom Headers

Set `LLM_EXTRA_HEADERS=Key:Value,Key2:Value2` to inject headers into every request. Useful for OpenRouter attribution (`HTTP-Referer`, `X-Title`). Invalid header names/values are skipped with a warning (not a fatal error).

## OpenAI Codex Provider

Uses the Responses API at `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` with ChatGPT subscription OAuth tokens (zero API cost — billing through subscription).

**Auth flow:** Device code OAuth via `auth.openai.com/api/accounts/deviceauth/*` endpoints. On first run, displays a code for the user to enter at a URL. Tokens are persisted to `~/.ironclaw/openai_codex_session.json` (mode 0600) and auto-refreshed before expiry.

**Provider chain:** `OpenAiCodexProvider` → `TokenRefreshingProvider` (pre-emptive refresh + retry on 401) → standard decorator chain. The `TokenRefreshingProvider` intercepts `AuthFailed`/`SessionExpired` errors, refreshes the OAuth token, and retries once.

**Key differences from other providers:**
- Uses Responses API (not Chat Completions) — SSE streaming with different event types
- System messages are sent as `instructions` field, not in `input` array
- Tool schemas are shaped by `tool_schema.rs`: `NearAiChatProvider` uses `FlattenOnly` so top-level combinators still get flattened for OpenAI-compatible chat-completions requests, while `RigAdapter::convert_tools` and `OpenAiCodexProvider` use the strict OpenAI policy that also rewrites optional object fields into required-nullable strict mode
- `cost_per_token()` returns `(0, 0)` — subscription-based billing
- `set_model()` returns error — model is fixed at construction time
- Image attachments are silently dropped with a warning log

**Env vars:** `OPENAI_CODEX_MODEL` (default: `gpt-5.5` — must be a model the ChatGPT account is entitled to; codex-only slugs like `gpt-5.3-codex` are rejected with HTTP 400 in subscription mode), `OPENAI_CODEX_CLIENT_ID`, `OPENAI_CODEX_AUTH_URL`, `OPENAI_CODEX_API_URL`.

## Provider Chain Construction

`build_provider_chain()` in `lib.rs` is the entry point for chain construction: it creates the base provider (dispatching to `create_openai_codex_provider()` for codex, `create_llm_provider()` for everything else), then delegates the decorator stack to `pub(crate) async fn apply_decorator_chain(raw, config, session)` — the single source of truth for decorator assembly. Assemble the chain only through `apply_decorator_chain`; never apply these decorators inline or at a higher seam. It is crate-internal; the integration-test harness wraps a scripted raw provider beneath the real chain via the test-only `testing::provider_chain_over` re-export (gated by the `test-support` feature), so the production API is not widened. The decorators `apply_decorator_chain` assembles, in order (`RecordingLlm` is appended afterward by `build_provider_chain`, not by `apply_decorator_chain`):

```
Raw provider
  → RetryProvider           (per-provider backoff; wraps both primary and fallback)
  → SmartRoutingProvider    (cheap/primary split when `cheap_model_name()` is non-None; resolves `LLM_CHEAP_MODEL` first, then `NEARAI_CHEAP_MODEL` as NearAI-only fallback)
  → FailoverProvider        (fallback model; only when NEARAI_FALLBACK_MODEL is set)
  → CircuitBreakerProvider  (fast-fail; only when LLM_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD is set)
  → CachedProvider          (response cache; only when LLM_RESPONSE_CACHE_ENABLED=true)

```

Host-managed requests with an explicit fallback index dispatch through the
same routing/failover stack but use the equivalent single-attempt provider for
that selected route. The agent loop owns retry and fallback advancement for
those requests, preventing an inner `RetryProvider` from duplicating a vendor
call before recovery can advance the ordered chain.

`build_provider_chain()` also returns a separate standalone cheap LLM provider (for heartbeat/evaluation tasks — not part of the decorator chain).

## reasoning.rs Contents

`reasoning.rs` does **not** contain an `IntentClassifier`, and it is **not** a
reasoning *engine* — the v1 `Reasoning` struct and its planner/evaluator types
were deleted in the WS8 dead-surface sweep. What survives is a provider-quirk
cleanup module with exactly three public functions, all consumed by the model
gateway in `crates/loop/ironclaw_loop_host/src/model_gateway.rs` on the live
model-response path (the gateway moved out of `ironclaw_turn_runner`; this
line used to cite the old home):
- `clean_response()` — thinking-tag stripping: regex-based, code-region-aware removal of `<thinking>`, `<reflection>`, `<scratchpad>`, `<|think|>`, `<final>`, tool-call tags, and markdown-fenced/bracket tool-call residue from model responses before they reach the user
- `contains_codex_text_tool_call_syntax()` — detects Codex textual tool-call syntax (`to=tool.name json\n{…}`) outside code regions
- `recover_codex_text_tool_calls_from_tool_names()` — recovers those textual calls as structured `ToolCall`s when the name matches an advertised tool

Everything else in the file is private support for those three.

## Cost table (moved to `ironclaw_common::llm_costs`)

The static per-model cost table moved to `crates/contracts/ironclaw_common/src/llm_costs.rs`
so surfaces above `ironclaw_llm` (product workflow, WebChat v2) can price a run's
usage without depending on this whole crate. It provides `model_cost(model_id)`
→ `(input_cost, output_cost)` per token as `rust_decimal::Decimal` (provider
prefixes like `"openai/gpt-4o"` stripped; `None` for unknowns → `default_cost()`
≈ GPT-4o; Ollama-style ids price at zero), plus `price_usage(...)` /
`RunCost::from_usage(...)` — the single shared source for per-run USD pricing.
Providers in this crate import it as `use ironclaw_common::llm_costs as costs;`
(a plain import alias, **not** a re-export — see the relocation note in
`.claude/rules/type-placement.md`).

## Anthropic Prompt Caching

Both Anthropic transports emit explicit `cache_control` breakpoints when
`cache_retention` (env: `ANTHROPIC_CACHE_RETENTION`) is not `none` (#6984):

- **OAuth transport** (`anthropic_oauth.rs`, `apply_cache_breakpoints`): system
  prompt block, last tool definition, and the last content block of the last
  message, all carrying the retention TTL (`{"type":"ephemeral"}` for short,
  `+ "ttl":"1h"` for long).
- **API-key transport** (`rig_adapter.rs`, `build_rig_request` +
  `create_anthropic_from_registry`): the top-level automatic-caching marker,
  an explicit marker on the last tool (moved into rig's raw
  `additional_params.tools`, which rig appends after typed tools), and — for
  `short` only — rig's typed system/last-message breakpoints
  (`CompletionModel::prompt_caching`). `long` must not enable the typed
  breakpoints: rig's markers cannot carry a TTL, and a 5m block marker with a
  1h automatic marker is an API error (TTL conflict on the last block).

All markers within a request share one TTL, satisfying Anthropic's
longer-TTL-first ordering rule. Models without cache support (claude-2 era)
downgrade to `none` via `supports_prompt_cache`. Wire shape is pinned by
capture-server tests in both files.

## rig_adapter.rs Details

`RigAdapter<M>` bridges any rig-core `CompletionModel` to `LlmProvider`. It is actively used in production for all non-NEAR AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Tinfoil, OpenAI-compatible). Key behaviors:
- **Per-request model overrides** are forwarded through rig-core's typed request model field, preserving one serialized top-level `model` key.
- **OpenAI strict-mode schema normalization** is applied to all tool definitions: `additionalProperties: false`, all properties added to `required`, optional fields made nullable via `"type": ["T", "null"]`. This happens transparently at the provider boundary.
- **System messages** are extracted into the rig-core `preamble` field (concatenated with newlines if multiple).
- **Tool call IDs** are generated (`generated_tool_call_{seed}`) if the provider returns empty/whitespace IDs.
- **Tool name normalization**: strips `proxy_` prefix if it matches a known tool (handles some proxy implementations).
- **OpenAI uses Chat Completions API** (`completions_api()`), not the newer Responses API — the Responses API path panics when tool results are sent back (rig-core doesn't thread `call_id` through `ToolCall`).

## Streaming Support

`LlmProvider` exposes `complete_streaming()` and `complete_with_tools_streaming()` for provider text deltas. Native streaming is enabled only where IronClaw can observe an authoritative terminal event: NEAR AI, Anthropic OAuth, and Codex Responses. Rig-backed OpenAI Chat Completions and Anthropic API-key providers retain the buffered trait fallback because rig-core 0.33 synthesizes its final response after EOF, so IronClaw cannot distinguish completion from truncation. Other unvalidated providers also remain buffered, including custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Gemini OAuth, GitHub Copilot, Bedrock, and Rig-backed Ollama, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and native Gemini.

Text deltas are advisory UI progress; the returned response remains authoritative for text, tool calls, finish reason, reasoning artifacts, and usage. Provider decorators must forward both streaming methods. Retry or failover must not append a replacement after visible partial text unless the sink advertises atomic text-replacement support. The response cache bypasses lookup for streaming calls because a stored response cannot reproduce provider deltas honestly.

## Trace Recording

Set `IRONCLAW_RECORD_TRACE=1` to enable live trace recording via `RecordingLlm`. Traces are JSON files containing: memory snapshot, HTTP exchanges from tools, and LLM steps (user inputs, text responses, tool call responses). Replay these in E2E tests via `TraceLlm`. Configure output path with `IRONCLAW_TRACE_OUTPUT` (default: `trace_{timestamp}.json`).

Arguments derived from an earlier tool result use an exact `$trace_result`
marker with the original `tool_call_id` and an RFC 6901 JSON Pointer.
