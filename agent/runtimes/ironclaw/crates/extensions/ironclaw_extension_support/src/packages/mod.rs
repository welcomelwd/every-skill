//! The first-party package inventory.
//!
//! One small module per package (`packages/<id>.rs`) owns that package's
//! embeds (manifest + WASM), asset descriptors, digest, and any bespoke display
//! or onboarding copy, beside its `assets/<id>/` directory. [`bundled_packages`]
//! concatenates the per-module bundles; composition and the CLI consume them as
//! opaque [`PackageBundle`]s and never name a package. See
//! `docs/internal/reborn/extension-runtime/overview.md` §3 (package self-containment).
//!
//! This crate is the sanctioned home for concrete package names — the
//! extension-specificity gate excludes it — so the names live here, next to the
//! assets they describe, and nowhere in generic code.
