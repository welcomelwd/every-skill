//! Extension Manifest v2.
//!
//! v2 is the manifest shape consumed by Reborn. It is intentionally additive in
//! this slice: this module ships alongside the v1 parser so downstream crates
//! can migrate one at a time. The v1 parser is deleted in the follow-up slice
//! once every caller is on v2.
//!
//! Key contract changes from v1:
//! - manifests carry a loader-supplied [`ManifestSource`]; first-party / system
//!   trust and runtime are only ever effective for [`ManifestSource::HostBundled`];
//! - extension IDs starting with `ironclaw.` are reserved for HostBundled;
//! - every manifest declares at least one `[[host_api]]` contract; top-level
//!   `[[capabilities]]` is rejected — capabilities are declared under
//!   `ironclaw.capability_provider/v1` sections;
//! - installed manifests must use `wasm` / `mcp` / `script` runtimes only;
//! - every capability declares `visibility`, relative
//!   [`CapabilityProfileSchemaRef`] input/output schema refs, optional lazy
//!   `prompt_doc_ref`, and the set of host ports it needs;
//! - host port names validate against a host-defined [`HostPortCatalog`].
//!
//! This module does **not** dispatch capabilities, load WASM modules, evaluate
//! trust policy, or grant authority. It is contract vocabulary only.
//!
//! ## Whitespace and field shape
//!
//! `name`, `version`, and `description` are rejected when empty or
//! whitespace-only, but the *exact* bytes from the TOML are preserved on the
//! validated manifest (no `trim`). `version` is treated as opaque,
//! registry-defined vocabulary — v2 does **not** require semver; downstream
//! consumers that need ordered comparison must parse it themselves.
//!
//! ## Serialization
//!
//! v2 deliberately ships `Deserialize`-only types. `ExtensionManifestV2` has
//! no `Serialize` impl: this module is a parser/validator contract, not a
//! registry write path. If a future diagnostic / registry tool needs round
//! tripping it should add a deliberate serialization layer with its own
//! schema.
