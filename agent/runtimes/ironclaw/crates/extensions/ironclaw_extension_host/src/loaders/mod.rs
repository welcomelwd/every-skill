//! Loader ports (overview.md §4.0).
//!
//! Each runtime kind produces one [`ExtensionEntrypoint`] per extension. The
//! host does not link the concrete lanes (that would re-couple the layers the
//! architecture gates protect); instead it consults an injected
//! [`ExtensionLoader`] that composition implements as a dispatch over the
//! native factory registry, the WASM tool lane, and the MCP loader. `load`
//! may perform I/O (the MCP loader runs discovery here); the resulting
//! `bind` is side-effect-free.
