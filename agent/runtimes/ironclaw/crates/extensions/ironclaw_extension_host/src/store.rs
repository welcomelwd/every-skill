//! Persistence port for installation lifecycle records.
//!
//! `ExtensionHost` is the only writer of installation state; this port is the
//! host's working set, rehydrated from the service's durable
//! `ExtensionActivationState` records at every boot. The record carries the
//! resolved contract (so a restore never needs the package source), the
//! current working state (`Installed` / `Active` / `Failed`), the non-secret
//! config values, and a typed, redacted last error.
//!
//! The in-memory implementation is the only implementation today: the host
//! record is a derived execution view, not the durable source of truth.
