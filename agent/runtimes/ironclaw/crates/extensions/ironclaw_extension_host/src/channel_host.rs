//! Generic per-extension channel host assembly (extension-runtime §5.3–§5.5).
//!
//! [`GenericChannelHostAssembly`] reconciles the [`ExtensionIngressRegistry`]
//! against manifest-declared deployment channels plus an active-snapshot
//! compatibility lane. Every discovered extension whose resolved contract
//! declares inbound channel ingress gets one registration — a dynamic
//! verification-secrets port over the
//! `[channel.config]` secret storage plus a [`GenericChannelInboundSink`]
//! over per-extension ProductSurface admission (durable idempotency ledger
//! and durable conversation binding at extension-keyed storage roots),
//! observed by the generic run-delivery observer when the composed runtime
//! has a delivery coordinator. Deployment registrations remain independent
//! of user activation; active-only registrations follow lifecycle changes.
//! Replacement is race-safe with in-flight requests (the registry swaps
//! `Arc` entries under one lock).
//!
//! Vendor residue that is not yet host-generic enters only through
//! [`ChannelExtras`]: the preference-target codec for the triggered delivery
//! driver and an optional storage-root override for a channel whose durable
//! state predates the generic root scheme.
