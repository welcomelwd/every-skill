//! Skill learning: turn-end skill distillation for the Reborn runtime.
//!
//! Mirrors the trace-capture sink (`trace_capture.rs`): every successful
//! terminal turn lifecycle event spawns a supervised best-effort task that reads
//! the just-finished run's transcript and, when the run is substantive enough,
//! distills a reusable `SKILL.md` via the learning model, safety-scans it,
//! installs it for the run's owner, and notifies the UI. The distillation
//! *logic* lives in `ironclaw_skills::learning`; this file owns the composition
//! seam: the eligibility gate, the transcript read, the inference adapter, the
//! scoped write, and the learned-skill live notification.
//!
//! Skill learning requires a learning LLM provider; the sink is only wired when
//! one is resolved from the runtime's LLM config.
//!
//! Invariants (shared with `trace_capture.rs`):
//! - Never block or fail the turn lifecycle path: the sink is subscribed
//!   best-effort and all work happens on a spawned task owned by the runtime
//!   shutdown path; task errors are logged at `debug!` only (`info!`/`warn!`
//!   corrupt the REPL).
//! - Scope is derived from the EVENT (tenant + owner), never from a runtime
//!   default — a wrong tenant writes a skill to a directory the WebUI and the
//!   next run never read (see `docs/plans/2026-06-16-reborn-skill-evolution.md`).
//! - Distilled content is injection-scanned before it is installed (it becomes
//!   trusted prompt text loaded into the next run).
