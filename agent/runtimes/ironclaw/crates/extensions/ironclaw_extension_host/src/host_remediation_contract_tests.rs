//! The structural guard for host-authored remediation text.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists
//!
//! #6299 folded every capability failure through the `ironclaw_host_api`
//! charter, which squeezed the free-text diagnostic through `SafeSummary`.
//! Every host-authored remediation string fails that contract (URLs, newlines,
//! backticks, the word `secret`), so all of them silently degraded to
//! "capability summary unavailable". Nothing went red, because the only
//! full-path coverage was ONE provider-readiness scenario and the failure mode
//! is degradation, not error.
//!
//! Two lessons are encoded here:
//!
//! 1. **Test the whole path, not one validator.** A prior spec that checked
//!    only the `ironclaw_threads` validator would have stayed green while
//!    production was broken. Each case below drives the real
//!    `FirstPartyCapabilityError` producer AND the real `ironclaw_turns`
//!    host_api hop AND the real `ironclaw_threads` persistence validator.
//! 2. **Assert the placeholder is ABSENT.** "an error was surfaced" passes
//!    while the UX is dead; only "the text is not the placeholder AND contains
//!    the expected step" catches degradation.
//!
//! Coverage is compiler-nudged, not compiler-proved. The cases come from
//! [`HostRemediationText::all`]; its exhaustiveness witness match plus the
//! `[HostRemediationText; 3]` length annotation force an author who adds a
//! VARIANT to update `ALL`. A new PRODUCER that calls
//! `dispatch_with_host_remediation` WITHOUT adding a variant is NOT caught by
//! the compiler and needs a manual audit
//! (`rg -n dispatch_with_host_remediation crates`).
