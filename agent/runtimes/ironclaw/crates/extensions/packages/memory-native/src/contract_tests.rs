//! Trait-level contract test harness for [`MemoryDocumentRepository`].
//!
//! This module establishes a **scaffolding pattern**: a single set of
//! invariants the trait promises is defined once here, and every impl
//! wires the suite once with a factory closure. The point is to move
//! coverage from "this mock has property X" to "every impl of this
//! trait has property X — by construction".
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Across several PR reviews (#3890, #3887, #3908) the same shape
//! recurred: a trait has multiple impls, isolation/durability/CAS
//! invariants every impl must honor, but tests only cover one impl —
//! often a mock that quietly implements its own invariants. Per
//! `.claude/rules/testing.md` ("Test Through the Caller, Not Just the
//! Helper"), a contract test against one impl proves only that impl,
//! not the contract. #3890 in particular found a search-isolation gap
//! that would have been impossible if every impl was forced through
//! the same suite.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! Each contract is a `pub async fn` taking a factory closure
//! `Fn() -> R`. The factory must produce a **fresh** repository per
//! call so suites cannot share state between contracts.
//!
//! Per-impl test files wire the suite via the [`contract_test!`]
//! macro, which expands to one `#[tokio::test]` per contract function
//! named `<impl_label>::<contract_name>` for clear failure
//! attribution.
//!
//! ## Non-goals
//!
//! This first scaffold intentionally covers a small surface
//! (isolation, round-trip, list filtering, search isolation). The
//! shape — not the breadth — is the point. Follow-up PRs can extend
//! the suite (CAS, metadata, append outcomes) and port other traits
//! (`IdempotencyLedger`, process repositories, and similar ports)
//! onto the same pattern.
