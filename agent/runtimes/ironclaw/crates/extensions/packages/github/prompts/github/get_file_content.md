Use `github.get_file_content` to fetch repository file content metadata/content.

For file blobs, GitHub returns the response `content` field base64-encoded; decode it before presenting raw file text.

Use the exact JSON field names from this capability schema. If the user provides a GitHub URL, extract the owner and repo fields plus the schema-specific number, path, or ref key; for pull-request tools, use `pr_number`; for issue tools, use `issue_number`.

This capability reads from the GitHub API through host HTTP egress and requires a configured GitHub product-auth account.
