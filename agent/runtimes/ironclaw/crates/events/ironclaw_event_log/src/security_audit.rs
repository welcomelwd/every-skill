//! Security-boundary audit primitive.
//!
//! [`SecurityAuditSink`] is a payload-free recording trait for *security
//! decisions* — the moments when a defense-in-depth boundary in IronClaw
//! Reborn allows, blocks, or otherwise re-shapes a request. It is intentionally
//! distinct from [`AuditSink`](crate::AuditSink) (which carries control-plane
//! `AuditEnvelope` records with full correlation context) and from
//! [`EventSink`](crate::EventSink) (which carries runtime event transitions).
//!
//! # Why a dedicated sink?
//!
//! Across recent PR review on hooks (#3573), no-exposure guard (#3767),
//! product-auth continuations (#3888), and the credential boundary (#3903),
//! the same pattern keeps recurring: security boundaries emit their decisions
//! via `tracing::warn!` or `tracing::error!`. The repo `CLAUDE.md` explicitly
//! forbids `warn!`/`info!` for non-user-facing diagnostics — those levels
//! corrupt the REPL/TUI rendering. CLAUDE.md *also* says:
//!
//! > LLM data is never deleted. All LLM output … is the most valuable data in
//! > the system. Never strip, truncate, or delete it from the database. Mark
//! > with timestamps, make filterable, but always retain.
//!
//! Security-boundary decisions are exactly this class of data: they must be
//! retained, filterable by boundary/decision/scope, and never be the only
//! signal carried on a `warn!` line.
//!
//! # Payload-free invariant
//!
//! [`SecurityAuditEvent`] deliberately has **no free-form `String` payload
//! field** — there is no `details`, `message`, `value`, or `reason: String`
//! into which a careless caller could stuff the secret/header/path that the
//! boundary just rejected. The event records only:
//!
//! - which boundary fired ([`SecurityBoundary`])
//! - what the decision was ([`SecurityDecision`])
//! - a `'static` reason **code** (grep target — see below)
//! - optional capability id and resource scope (already redaction-safe types)
//! - a timestamp
//!
//! This invariant is **load-bearing**. Do not add a `String` field. If you
//! need a new dimension, extend [`SecurityBoundary`] or [`SecurityDecision`],
//! or add a `&'static str` code constant.
//!
//! # The `code` convention
//!
//! `SecurityAuditEvent::code` is a short, stable, `&'static str`. It exists
//! so that SRE/ops can grep durable logs for a specific decision class
//! (`leak_redact_failed`, `no_exposure_block_header`, `hook_deny_predicate`,
//! `auth_continuation_replay`, `mcp_direct_lease_deny`, ...). Treat it like a
//! metric name: lowercase, snake_case, never user-derived, never PII, never a
//! secret. New codes should be added as `pub const` items in the module that
//! owns the boundary so they are visible to consumers.
