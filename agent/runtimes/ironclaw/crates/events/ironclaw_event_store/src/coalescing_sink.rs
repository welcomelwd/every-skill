//! Write-behind coalescing runtime [`EventSink`].
//!
//! The durable runtime event log is append-only and *derived* (projections
//! fold it; durable cursors persisted elsewhere can outlive it). Its appends
//! are observability writes whose returned cursor is discarded at the sink
//! (`DurableEventSink::emit` → `.map(|_| ())`), so nothing on the hot path
//! gates a side effect on synchronous durability of an individual event.
//!
//! [`CoalescingEventSink`] exploits that: `emit` buffers the event in memory
//! and returns immediately; a single background drain task flushes the buffer
//! as **one multi-row INSERT per stream per drain window** (via
//! [`DurableEventLog::append_batch`]). A per-turn burst of ~21–57 single-row
//! INSERTs collapses to one round-trip, while crash-loss is bounded to the
//! unflushed sub-second tail.
//!
//! **This is a runtime-event-only optimization.** The compliance audit log
//! (`DurableAuditSink`) is a separate sink and stays synchronous.
//!
//! ## Ordering & durability
//!
//! - All flushes are awaited sequentially in the single drain task, so the
//!   global append order is preserved; within a stream the multi-row INSERT
//!   assigns contiguous, monotonic seqs in buffer order.
//! - A flush is one atomic multi-row INSERT — there is no torn batch. On a
//!   crash, every flushed batch is durable and only the in-memory tail
//!   (bounded by `flush_interval` or `max_batch`) is lost.
//! - The [`EventSink::flush`] override drains everything queued before the
//!   call, for graceful shutdown and deterministic tests.
//! - The internal channel is bounded ([`CHANNEL_CAPACITY`]). Events emitted
//!   while the channel is full are dropped (best-effort sink contract) and
//!   counted via [`CoalescingEventSink::dropped_count`].
//!
//! ## Loss semantics — best-effort by design, NOT at-least-once
//!
//! This sink is **lossy under stress on purpose**. It carries best-effort
//! observability events whose returned cursor is discarded at the sink, so
//! none of these losses can alter a runtime/control-plane outcome. There are
//! three stress-path drop modes (beyond the crash-tail loss noted under
//! Ordering & durability above), all bounded and observable:
//!
//! 1. **Overload drop** — sustained back-pressure fills the bounded channel;
//!    `emit` drops (it must never block the caller per the [`EventSink`]
//!    contract) and increments `dropped_count`. Back-pressure or an overflow
//!    WAL would both violate the contract / re-introduce the unbounded-memory
//!    failure this bound exists to prevent.
//! 2. **Per-event reject** — a backend `append_batch` rejects some rows. The
//!    successful rows are still durably committed (`append_batch` preserves the
//!    successful prefix and returns per-event results); only the rejected rows
//!    are lost. They are NOT requeued: retrying in this single serialized drain
//!    loop would head-of-line-block every other stream and, under a flapping
//!    backend, grow memory unboundedly — the same failure the channel bound
//!    avoids.
//! 3. **Drain panic** — a backend driver panics inside the spawned append; the
//!    whole window for that flush is lost and `error!`-logged. Retrying a
//!    panicking append is a panic loop, so the next window simply proceeds.
//!
//! If a stream ever needs at-least-once durability, it does not belong on this
//! sink — the compliance audit log (`DurableAuditSink`) is a separate,
//! synchronous, non-coalescing sink for exactly that.
