//! Input DTO for the assembled Reborn runtime (`build_reborn_runtime`).
//!
//! `RebornRuntimeInput` extends `RebornHostBindings` (which is substrate-only)
//! with the additional knobs needed to assemble a runnable agent:
//!
//! - **LLM configuration** (optional).
//!   Used by the composition root to construct an `LlmProviderModelGateway`
//!   that satisfies the loop-host `HostManagedModelGateway` contract.
//! - **Turn-runner configuration** — poll/heartbeat intervals for the worker
//!   loop.
//! - **Completion polling configuration** — interval/timeout policy for
//!   waiting on submitted turns to finish.
//! - **Runtime identity** — tenant/agent and source/reply binding identifiers
//!   supplied by the caller so this composition root stays channel-agnostic.
//! - **Skill context source** — optional caller-supplied override for
//!   model-visible skill instructions. When absent, supported runtime profiles
//!   wire the first-party filesystem skill source from scoped Reborn skill
//!   roots.
//!
//! The CLI builds this struct from env vars / config; it does not call into
//! `ironclaw_turn_runner` or `ironclaw_llm` directly.
