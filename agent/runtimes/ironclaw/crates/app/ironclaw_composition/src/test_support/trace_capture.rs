//! Trace-capture `TurnEventSink` test support (C-TRACECAP seam).

/// Build the SAME `TraceCaptureTurnEventSink` production fans into
/// `DefaultPlannedRuntimeParts.turn_event_sink` inside `build_reborn_runtime`
/// (`runtime.rs`, "Autonomous Trace Commons capture"), seeded with the
/// runtime owner's tenant-scoped trace scope key — the identical
/// `trace_scope_key(tenant, owner)` recipe, so the test path never drifts
/// from production wiring. Capture stays policy-gated per scope (inert until
/// the scope enrolls), exactly as in production.
///
/// Returns the sink alongside the EXACT scope key it was seeded with, so the
/// caller has a single source of truth instead of recomputing
/// `trace_scope_key(tenant_id, actor_user_id)` a second time (which risks the
/// two call sites drifting if either recipe ever changes independently).
