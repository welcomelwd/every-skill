//! Config-driven memory provider factory (issue #3537 / #5264).
//!
//! This is the memory analog of `ironclaw_embeddings::factory::create_provider`:
//! a pure-data connection config + a runtime [`MemoryProviderDeps`] struct feed an
//! function that `match`es the resolved [`MemoryProviderBinding`] and builds the
//! matching concrete [`MemoryService`] — native (filesystem) or a third party
//! (currently mem0, over its real `reqwest` transport). Missing credentials or an
//! unknown id yield `None` (fail-closed), exactly like the embeddings factory.
//!
//! Composition is the one layer that may name concrete provider crates
//! (`ironclaw_memory_native`, `ironclaw_memory_mem0`); `ironclaw_host_runtime`'s
//! [`MemoryServiceResolver`] stays provider-agnostic and only stores the
//! `Arc<dyn MemoryService>` instances this factory builds.
//!
//! [`resolve_memory_provider`] is the build-time wiring used at startup:
//! resolve policy → build + register a bound third-party provider → load the
//! BOUND provider's manifest bundle (its registrable package + declared
//! lifecycle). Production third-party bindings stay fail-closed/override-gated
//! by the upstream [`MemoryBindingPolicy`]; this factory never relaxes that —
//! it only constructs a provider for a binding the policy already permitted.
