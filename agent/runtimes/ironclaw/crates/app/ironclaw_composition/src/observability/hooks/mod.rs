//! Production activation of the hook framework.
//!
//! This module is the single composition seam that flips the (otherwise
//! dormant) hook framework into the live capability-invocation path. It owns:
//!
//! 1. **The feature flag** ([`HooksActivationConfig`]) — default OFF. When
//!    OFF, [`build_hook_dispatcher_builder_factory`] returns `None` and the
//!    runtime composes exactly as it did before hooks existed (zero behavior
//!    change). This is the hard rollout-safety contract for the activation.
//! 2. **The first-party builtin hook set** ([`factory::install_first_party_hooks`]) —
//!    installed regardless of extensions. The production catalog is
//!    deliberately **EMPTY**: no real first-party builtin hook has been
//!    productized, so we ship none. A production type + install path + behavior
//!    for a hook that does nothing is scaffolding, not a deliverable. The
//!    activation machinery is exercised end-to-end with test-only hooks (see
//!    the `#[cfg(test)]` `NoOpObserverHook` and the test-only first-party
//!    installer seam in [`tests`]), not with a shipped no-op. An empty
//!    first-party set composed with no extension hooks is a legitimate state —
//!    the dispatcher composes with zero bindings, which is valid (not a
//!    panic/error).
//! 3. **The manifest → registry loader** ([`factory::project_extension_hook_sets`])
//!    — takes the hook-only [`projection::HookProjection`] of each installed
//!    extension, projects each declared `[[hooks]]` payload into a typed
//!    [`ironclaw_hooks::manifest::HookManifestEntry`], and installs them
//!    through [`ironclaw_hooks::registrar::HookRegistrar::install`] at the
//!    `Installed` trust tier. Trust attenuation is enforced by construction:
//!    the registrar only ever calls `install_installed_*`, so an extension hook
//!    can never mint `Allow` / `Gate` / `Mutator` without an explicit
//!    per-extension grant.
//! 4. **The per-run dispatcher builder factory** — returned to the runtime to
//!    pass to `RebornLoopDriverHostFactory::with_hook_dispatcher_builder_
//!    factory`. The closure mints a *fresh* [`HookDispatcherBuilder`] per host
//!    build (per run), so slot-poisoning and registry mutations never leak
//!    across runs. Telemetry attribution is per-run because the host factory
//!    attaches the run-scoped milestone sink internally to each fresh builder.
//!
//! ## Module layout (#3951 P1 finding #4 decomposition)
//!
//! The activation logic is split into focused submodules, behavior-preserving:
//!
//! - [`projection`] — the hook-only [`projection::HookProjection`] /
//!   [`HookProjectionRegistry`] containment types, plus the discovery/admission
//!   pipeline ([`projection::build_hook_projection_registry`]) and the
//!   tenant-root / path-containment helpers.
//! - [`factory`] — first-party install, install-time per-extension quarantine
//!   validation ([`factory::project_extension_hook_sets`]), and the
//!   fresh-per-build dispatcher factory builders.
//! - [`audit`] — `hook.quarantined` security-audit emission.
//! - `tests` — the unit-test matrix (test-only; compiled under `cfg(test)`).
//!
//! ## Per-tenant scoping (multi-tenant isolation contract, #3890)
//!
//! `build_reborn_runtime` is invoked once per identity/owner — one
//! `tenant_id` per call. Everything this module constructs (the
//! [`ironclaw_hooks::evaluator::PredicateEvaluator`] + its state backend, the
//! template registry, the per-run dispatcher closure) is built inside that
//! per-tenant call, so one tenant's hooks and predicate counters can never
//! apply to another. There is no global registry.
//!
//! ## Predicate backend (in-memory for v1)
//!
//! The evaluator uses the in-memory predicate-state backend for now. The
//! backend is swappable
//! ([`ironclaw_hooks::evaluator::PredicateEvaluator::with_state_backend`]) so
//! the durable Postgres/libSQL backends (#3933 + follow-ups) can drop in
//! without touching this module's wiring.
