//! Project [`BudgetEvent`](ironclaw_resources::BudgetEvent) records.
//!
//! The runtime owns a `tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender<BudgetEvent>` via
//! [`BroadcastBudgetEventSink`]. Production composition spawns a
//! [`BudgetEventProjection`] task at runtime construction; the task
//! receives every emitted event and hands it to a
//! [`BudgetEventObserver`] for delivery.
//!
//! The default observer logs at `debug!`. Production owners that need to
//! fan budget events out to SSE / WS / external telemetry pass their own
//! observer through
//! [`RebornRuntimeInput::with_budget_event_observer`](crate::RebornRuntimeInput).
