//! Skills on the PRODUCTION composition, not local-dev.
//!
//! Everything else validating this work runs against local-dev or the benchmark harness, and both
//! reach production behaviour through seams production does not use: disk-mounted skill roots, env
//! overrides, a workspace `.skills` directory. That is how a whole class of problem stayed hidden —
//! agent-authored skills escaping to the host's `~/.claude/skills`, a copy-out scanning disk while
//! the store is libSQL, a benchmark scoring only what the model requested while the host picked
//! freely. Each was an artifact of the instrument, not the system.
//!
//! So this builds the real thing: `RebornCompositionProfile::Production` over libSQL, with the
//! hosted multi-tenant runtime policy — scoped-virtual filesystem, brokered secrets, network deny,
//! ask-always approvals. No mounts, no env switches.
//!
//! **What this test establishes, and the gap it exposes.**
//!
//! The production composition builds, opens a conversation, and runs a skill-execution turn — so
//! skills are wired on the production path. But a skill written to
//! `tenants/<t>/users/<u>/skills/` **on disk is invisible to it**: production resolves the skill
//! store through the scoped-virtual filesystem (libSQL), not the host filesystem. Measured here:
//! explicit `$name` activation returned an empty activation set for a disk-seeded skill.
//!
//! That is not a product bug — it is the storage contract. It means something else, though, and it
//! is the honest answer to "would this work in production": **every other validation of this work
//! seeds skills on disk, so none of it exercises production's storage path.** The benchmark mounts
//! `system/skills`, the local-dev tests write files, and both are real paths for their profiles and
//! neither is production's.
//!
//! Closing that needs a seam this crate does not expose: installing a skill into the production
//! scoped-virtual store from a test, i.e. driving `builtin.skill_install` through the production
//! capability port rather than writing bytes to a directory. That is ironclaw infrastructure work
//! with an owner other than this PR, so it is recorded here rather than approximated — a test that
//! seeds disk and asserts success would report production coverage it does not have.
