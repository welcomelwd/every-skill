//! Budget pause / approval-gate E2E tests (#3841 follow-ups).
//!
//! These tests drive a `send_user_message` past the pause threshold so the
//! accountant returns `BudgetApprovalRequired`, opens a budget gate, and the
//! turn parks in `BlockedResource`. They assert that **observable** blocking
//! outcome through production seams only:
//!
//! * the budget cap is configured through the production
//!   [`RebornRuntimeInput::with_budget_defaults`] seam and seeded on the fresh
//!   user's first model call;
//! * the pause is observed through `send_user_message_until_gate`, which
//!   surfaces the same `RebornTurnDriveOutcome::BlockedOnGate { gate_ref, .. }`
//!   a real caller (the WebUI product surface) sees when a run parks on a gate;
//! * the `BudgetEvent::GateOpened` carrying the real persisted gate id is
//!   observed through the public
//!   [`RebornRuntime::broadcast_budget_event_sink`] subscription — the same
//!   fan-out the production projection drains.
//!
//! ## Not covered here — no production resolution seam
//!
//! The former F3 (approve-with-increased-limit → retry succeeds), F4 (cancel →
//! retry stays blocked), and F5 (expire → retry stays blocked) scenarios drove
//! budget-gate **resolution** directly through the runtime's
//! `budget_gate_store()` + `apply_resolved_budget_gate()` test accessors.
//! Those accessors were removed with the runtime store unification, and budget
//! gate resolution (approve / cancel / expire) is **not** wired to any
//! production caller today (the gate store is written only by the accountant
//! opening gates; nothing resolves them outside the deleted test hooks). There
//! is therefore no observable seam through which to drive resolution, so those
//! scenarios are intentionally not reproduced here. See the accompanying report
//! for the STOP rationale; they should return once a real gate-resolution route
//! exists (the runtime comment pointed at a future web-gateway resolution
//! surface).
