//! `google_remediation_text` is consumed by two independent surfaces that
//! must not drift apart:
//!
//! - `ironclaw_cli::commands::config::capability_config` — printed as
//!   `config set google.*` follow-up guidance.
//! - `ironclaw_composition::extension_host::gsuite` — printed in the
//!   Gmail/Google Workspace "not configured" tool-result error a capability
//!   dispatch returns before it ever reaches credential resolution.
//!
//! `ironclaw_cli` depends on `ironclaw_composition`, never the
//! reverse, so this text cannot live in the CLI crate (composition could not
//! import it). It lives here instead, since both crates already depend on
//! `ironclaw_config`.
