//! Binary-assembled first-party capability wiring (extension-runtime DEL-7).
//!
//! The CLI is the one generic-side crate allowed to link
//! `ironclaw_extension_support`; it converts the concrete package inventory
//! into extension-host's neutral bundle set, supplies the concrete GSuite /
//! web-access capability handler registrars, and injects the Google-account
//! credential visibility policy. Composition receives all of this as input and
//! never names a concrete first-party extension.
//!
//! This module lives OUTSIDE `src/runtime/` because the CLI runtime tree is
//! banned from `use ironclaw_host_runtime::` (a dependency-boundary test); the
//! host-runtime / host-api types these builders touch are named from their
//! owning crates, while auth-owned contracts are named from `ironclaw_auth`.
