//! `ironclaw service` — install/manage the standalone Reborn
//! binary as an OS-native service.
//!
//! - **macOS**: launchd user agent at
//!   `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ironclaw.reborn.plist`.
//! - **Linux**: systemd user unit at
//!   `~/.config/systemd/user/ironclaw-reborn.service`.
//!
//! The installed service runs `<current_exe> serve`, restarting
//! automatically on failure. Mirrors v1's `src/service.rs` shape with
//! Reborn's label, paths, and env-passthrough contract; no v1 code is
//! shared or reused.
//!
//! Platform dispatch happens once, in [`ServicePlatform::detect`], called
//! a single time from [`ServiceCommand::execute`]. Each verb is a method
//! on [`ServicePlatform`] that `match self`es to delegate into the
//! OS-specific implementation (`launchd` or `systemd`), rather than every
//! verb re-checking `cfg!(target_os)`.
//!
//! ## Canonical service identity, shared with the WebUI operator facade
//!
//! [`SERVICE_LABEL`] and [`SYSTEMD_UNIT`] name the **one** OS service
//! identity for the standalone Reborn binary. Two surfaces install and
//! manage it today: this CLI (`ironclaw service install`), and the
//! WebUI operator facade (`OperatorServiceLifecycle` in
//! `ironclaw_operator::operator_service_lifecycle`,
//! behind `POST /api/webchat/v2/operator/service`). Both target the same
//! plist/unit path, so an install from either surface atomically replaces
//! whatever the other last wrote there — see [`write_atomic`].
//!
//! The two implementations are not yet unified: `composition` cannot
//! depend on this CLI crate (dependency direction runs the other way), so
//! there is no shared crate to host one implementation today. Until that
//! consolidation lands, this CLI's unit is the target state — it is
//! secret-free (only `HOME`/profile env, no bearer token; `serve` reads
//! the WebUI token from the 0600 token file at start), where the facade's
//! generated unit bakes the WebUI bearer token directly into the unit
//! file's `Environment=` lines. A CLI install replacing a facade-installed
//! unit is therefore a security improvement, not just a collision to
//! avoid.
