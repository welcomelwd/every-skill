# Reborn CLI Agent Contract

This crate owns the standalone `ironclaw` command surface. Keep it small, explicit, and safe for agents to extend. Orientation (what the crate is, measured deps/consumers) lives in `README.md`; family rules in `crates/app/AGENTS.md`. This file is gate-pinned: `reborn_dependency_boundaries.rs` asserts it exists and keeps its command-layout phrases.

## Command layout

- Use one command per file under `src/commands/`.
- Register each command in `src/commands/mod.rs` and dispatch through `Command::execute`.
- Keep `src/cli.rs` as the clap root only: parse top-level CLI and hand off to command modules.
- Put shared process/env boot state in `RebornCliContext` from `src/context.rs`.

## Boundaries

- Commands that need Reborn boot config must receive `RebornCliContext` from dispatch instead of reading env directly. Pure commands that do not need boot config (for example, shell completion generation) must not force Reborn home resolution.
- Keep commands side-effect free unless the command name and issue explicitly require mutation.
- Use `IRONCLAW_REBORN_HOME` / `~/.ironclaw/reborn`; do not write current v1 state.
- no v1 runtime imports. (The `ironclaw_legacy` root package, its `src/` tree, and `ironclaw_engine` have all been deleted, so this is now unenforceable-by-construction rather than a live hazard.)
- Do not add workspace dependencies beyond the current `[dependencies]` set without an architecture test update and explicit PR rationale. That set is `ironclaw_composition`, `ironclaw_config`, `ironclaw_trace_commons`, `ironclaw_webui` (host-owned WebUI serve lifecycle), `ironclaw_operator` (operator/admin implementation), `ironclaw_host_api` (neutral provider DTO contracts), `ironclaw_auth` (auth-owned contracts used by binary-assembled first-party wiring), `ironclaw_product_contracts` and `ironclaw_extension_contracts` (neutral product/extension DTO contracts), and the binary-supplied extension packages `ironclaw_extension_host`, `ironclaw_extension_manager` (the extension-management product face split out of the host in WS2.4 — the `extension` and `ironhub` commands render it), `ironclaw_extension_support`, `ironclaw_slack_extension`, `ironclaw_telegram_extension`, `ironclaw_web_app_extension` plus its domain crate `ironclaw_web_app` (the binary constructs the web-app adapter and package-owned initializer; the binary is the only place concrete extensions may be linked). Re-derive with `grep -n '^ironclaw' crates/app/ironclaw_cli/Cargo.toml`. Provider registry/model UX should enter through the operator/admin facade, not a separate CLI-only path; product-auth workflow should enter through auth-owned contracts rather than composition-owned facades.

## Adding a command

1. Add `src/commands/<name>.rs` with a clap `Args` type and an `execute` method.
2. Add a variant to `commands::Command`.
3. If the command needs boot config, resolve `RebornCliContext` in `commands::Command::execute` and pass it into the command handler.
4. If the command is pure, do not resolve `RebornCliContext` just to run it.
5. Add a binary smoke test in `tests/smoke.rs` that invokes `env!("CARGO_BIN_EXE_ironclaw")`.
6. If the command can touch state, assert it uses Reborn home only and does not create/read v1 DB/settings/secrets.
7. Run:
   - `cargo test -p ironclaw`
   - `cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests reborn`
   - `cargo clippy -p ironclaw --all-targets -- -D warnings`

## The `serve` subcommand

The WebChat v2 HTTP gateway subcommand (`ironclaw serve`) is compiled into
every build:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/app/ironclaw_cli
# or, from a workspace checkout
cargo build -p ironclaw --release
```

`crates/product/ironclaw_webui/build.rs` runs the frontend bundler from a Cargo build
script, so any build needs Node.js plus corepack/pnpm available (the pinned
package is in `build.rs`). The generated bundle is written under `$OUT_DIR`
and is not committed.

`ironclaw --help` lists `serve`, verified by `help_mentions_reborn_commands`
in `tests/smoke.rs`, alongside the serve smoke tests
(`serve_help_mentions_host_and_port`,
`serve_fails_closed_when_env_bearer_token_var_is_unset`, etc.).

The descriptor-level "all v2 routes are actually mounted" regression
lives at the composition layer in
`crates/app/ironclaw_composition/tests/webui_v2_serve.rs`
(`every_webui_v2_descriptor_is_mounted_on_composed_app`), not here —
that test drives the same `webui_v2_app` the CLI's `serve` hands to
`serve_webui_v2`, so a route that's declared in `webui_v2_routes()` but
forgotten by composition fails the build before the CLI binary smoke
tests run.
