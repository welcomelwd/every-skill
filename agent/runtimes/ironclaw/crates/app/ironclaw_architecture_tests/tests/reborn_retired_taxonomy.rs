//! Zero-legacy gate for retired Reborn vocabulary.
//!
//! The NEA-25 unified extension model retired an entire vocabulary: the
//! connectable-channels rail, the one-variant lifecycle surface kind, the
//! conflated extension `kind` wire string, the split `slack_bot` package
//! identity, the `slack_personal` provider id, and the contract-free manifest
//! parse paths. The channel-delivery-tool stack then retired stored delivery
//! *routing*: the per-run route-current seal, the target-setting capability,
//! the per-trigger `delivery_target_id` field, and the triggered-delivery
//! intent. This test pins all of it at **zero occurrences** across Reborn code
//! and model-visible guidance (`crates/` including the WebUI frontend sources
//! and packaged extension manifests/schemas, `tests/integration/`, and the
//! embedded `skills/` bundles) so none of it can be reintroduced silently.
//!
//! Sanctioned exceptions are path-scoped, and each path names the exact terms
//! it may use:
//! - the one-time forward data migration under `product_auth/durable/`
//!   legitimately names the retired identities it folds forward;
//! - the retirement's own regression tests must spell the retired input they
//!   prove is rejected or absent;
//! - this test names every term on purpose.
//!
//! The list is shrink-only and pinned to reality — see `SANCTIONED_PATHS`.
