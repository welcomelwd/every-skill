//! CHECKLIST WS5, the `ironclaw_operator` row — the operator port inversion
//! (PROPOSAL §6.1.3, §6.9.2).
//!
//! `ironclaw_operator` is a **sibling** of `ironclaw_assistant`, not a consumer
//! of it: both sit in the `products` layer and the operator crate implements
//! product-side ports rather than calling product. Declaring those ports inside
//! `ironclaw_assistant` inverted the ownership — the implementor had to compile
//! the 57k-line crate it sits beside just to name the trait it satisfies. This
//! row moved the declarations to `ironclaw_product_contracts`; this file keeps
//! them there.
//!
//! **Why a purpose-built gate rather than the layer matrix.** The same reason
//! `reborn_extension_host_port_inversion.rs` exists for the extension host:
//! `ironclaw_operator` and `ironclaw_assistant` both declare `layer = "products"`
//! and `layer_allows_dependency("products", "products")` is `true`, so this edge
//! is *legal by the matrix and invisible to it*. Nothing in
//! `reborn_dependency_boundaries.rs` could ever have reported it.
//!
//! Four halves:
//!
//! 1. **The residue is frozen, exact-match and shrink-only.** Product-declared
//!    traits `ironclaw_operator` still implements are enumerated with a reason
//!    each. It is currently **empty** — the inversion is complete — so any new
//!    entry is a regression and the baseline can only fall.
//! 2. **The manifest edge is gone, proved through `cargo metadata`.** A
//!    trait-shaped rule cannot see a dependency carried by a *type*; the
//!    manifest can. Resolved through `cargo metadata` rather than by reading a
//!    literal path, so a crate directory rename (WS10 moves this crate to
//!    `product/`) fails loudly instead of silently scanning nothing.
//! 3. **The inverted ports are pinned where they landed** — declared in
//!    contracts, *not* re-declared in product, and still implemented by the
//!    crate that owns the implementation. A revert is loud.
//! 4. **The scanner is self-tested and cannot go vacuous.** The impl reader is
//!    exercised over every impl shape the workspace actually uses, every I/O
//!    error is fatal, and each walk asserts it found something.

// The shared walker is compiled per test binary; each binary uses a subset.
