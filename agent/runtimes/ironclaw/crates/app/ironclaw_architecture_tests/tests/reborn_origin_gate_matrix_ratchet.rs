//! Origin→gate matrix architecture ratchet (§5.2.1/§5.2.7/§10 of the Reborn
//! authorization design; S5 of #6396).
//!
//! S2–S4 turned the per-origin gate matrix into declarative capability data
//! (`OriginGateMatrix`), populated it on every PRODUCTION descriptor, and folded
//! it into `authorize()` as a two-tier gate. This ratchet locks in the invariants
//! that keep that matrix honest. It changes NO production behavior — it only fails
//! a build that would silently weaken the origin→gate contract.
//!
//! ## What each assertion protects
//!
//! 1. **The Ungated-for-LoopRun allowlist is pinned to its reviewed seed.**
//!    `UNGATED_LOOP_RUN_CAPABILITIES` (`ironclaw_host_api`) is the exact set of
//!    builtins the model (`LoopRun` origin) may invoke with NO approval gate. It
//!    is the security-critical list: an entry here is a capability whose effects
//!    reviewers judged safe to run ungated. This test freezes the current 17 ids
//!    (checked-in `EXPECTED_UNGATED_SEED`) so any addition or removal is a
//!    reviewed diff — the same "frozen list only changes under review" property
//!    `reborn_capability_dto_collapse_ratchet` gives its DTO set. An addition
//!    ungates a capability for the model and MUST be a deliberate, reviewed change.
//!
//! 2. **No hand-authored extension TOML ungates a capability off-allowlist, and
//!    every declared capability carries a well-formed matrix.** The first-party
//!    extension manifests are the hand-authored source where a one-word typo
//!    (`loop_run = "ungated"` on a networked, credentialed capability) would
//!    silently remove its approval gate. This test parses every manifest asset and
//!    asserts, for every declared capability:
//!    - it carries an `origin_gate_matrix` with a `loop_run` policy — the
//!      TOML-source half of "every production descriptor declares `Some(..)`"
//!      (§5.2.1 invariant 1; the derived-descriptor half is enumerated elsewhere,
//!      see below);
//!    - that matrix never uses `consent_sufficient` on the `loop_run`/`automation`
//!      columns — `ConsentSufficient` is Product-only per §5.2.1 (the §11.7
//!      per-descriptor self-consistency check, applied to the TOML source);
//!    - any `ungated` `loop_run` has its id in the reviewed allowlist.
//!
//!    The scan covers every shipped package manifest under
//!    `crates/extensions/packages/` — the twelve extension packages and the
//!    two host-bundled always-on `ironclaw.memory` providers, which WS2's
//!    colocation brought under the same root. Today the only `ungated` TOML
//!    capabilities are the allowlisted read-only memory tools
//!    (`ironclaw.memory.read`/`search`/`tree`); every installable extension
//!    capability remains gated.
//!
//! ## Behavior-preserving grandfathered seed (deviates from §10 "starts empty")
//!
//! The design doc's §10 imagines the Ungated allowlist STARTING EMPTY and growing
//! only under review. S3 instead SEEDED it with the 17 builtins already ungated
//! under today's `AskDestructive` effect gate (their effects are a subset of
//! `{read_filesystem, dispatch_capability}` or are approval-exempt) — a deliberate
//! behavior-preservation choice so folding the matrix into `authorize()` (S4)
//! changed no user-visible gating. A future tightening slice REMOVES entries (each
//! a reviewed diff this ratchet forces), walking the seed toward the §10 empty
//! ideal. This test therefore pins the seed as-is: shrinking it is expected and
//! welcome (update `EXPECTED_UNGATED_SEED` in the same PR); silently growing it is
//! the security regression to catch.
//!
//! ## Where invariant 1's REAL (derived-descriptor) enumeration lives
//!
//! "Every PRODUCTION kernel descriptor declares `Some(origin_gate_matrix)`" is
//! enforced authoritatively where descriptors are actually built from the
//! manifest→descriptor path — not by a Rust text scan here. `ironclaw_architecture_tests`
//! is a leaf test crate and must not take a production dependency on the
//! composition/host_runtime crates that assemble descriptors, so it guards the two
//! invariants a leaf crate CAN own soundly: the pinned allowlist (imported from
//! its owner) and the hand-authored TOML source scan. The derived-descriptor
//! enumeration tests, which fail on a `None` descriptor and pin its well-formed
//! matrix, are:
//!   - builtins package — `ironclaw_host_runtime` →
//!     `builtin_first_party_package_declares_expected_capabilities`;
//!   - extension-lifecycle caps — `ironclaw_composition` →
//!     `extension_lifecycle_capabilities_declare_behavior_neutral_origin_gate_matrix`;
//!   - bundled extensions — `ironclaw_composition` →
//!     `bundled_extension_capabilities_carry_behavior_neutral_origin_gate_matrix`.
