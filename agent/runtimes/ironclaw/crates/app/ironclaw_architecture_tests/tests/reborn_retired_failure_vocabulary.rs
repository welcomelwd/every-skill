//! Zero-legacy gate for the unified failure vocabulary (#6284).
//!
//! Five enums used to answer one question — *why did this operation fail* —
//! each re-declaring the domain at a different altitude:
//!
//! | retired | crate | variants |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `FailureKind` (open-set shape) | `ironclaw_host_api` | 19 |
//! | `CapabilityFailureKind` | `ironclaw_turns` | 19 (identical names) |
//! | `RuntimeFailureKind` | `ironclaw_host_runtime` | 17 (strict subset) |
//! | `CapabilityErrorClass` | `ironclaw_agent_loop` | 7 |
//!
//! Re-declared domains drift, and the drift is where recoverability died: the
//! fold from the 22 mechanism-precise dispatch names down to 12 coarse ones
//! destroyed 17 names — and with them every remediation hint the model could
//! have acted on.
//!
//! They are now one closed `ironclaw_host_api::result_meta::FailureKind` plus projection
//! functions (`fate()`, retry-category, wire tag, HTTP status). Every
//! projection is a wildcard-free exhaustive match beside the single
//! definition, so a new kind cannot compile until each consumer classifies it.
//!
//! This test pins the retired names at **zero live occurrences** so the
//! collapse cannot quietly reverse — a cleanup nobody enforces is a cleanup
//! that comes back.
//!
//! **Comments are exempt on purpose.** Doc comments that explain what was
//! retired and why are worth keeping; only code is policed. The scan therefore
//! skips comment lines rather than path-scoping the files that carry that
//! history.
