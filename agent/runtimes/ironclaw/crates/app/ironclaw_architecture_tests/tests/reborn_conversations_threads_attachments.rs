//! CHECKLIST WS5 — the `conversations`/`threads` naming trap and the
//! `attachments` widening (PROPOSAL §6.4.1, §6.4.2, §6.4.9).
//!
//! Three rules, each pinning one half of that work so it cannot silently
//! regress:
//!
//! 1. **`ironclaw_conversations` and `ironclaw_threads` share no type name.**
//!    Discovered, not enumerated: every type either crate declares is compared
//!    against the other's, so a *new* collision is caught the day it is
//!    introduced rather than the day someone has to alias around it. Before
//!    this row the two crates shared five names — `SessionThreadService`,
//!    `AcceptInboundMessageRequest`, `AcceptedInboundMessage`,
//!    `AcceptedInboundMessageReplay`, `ThreadMessageRecord` — and the one file
//!    that had to hold both, composition's trusted-trigger submit, carried four
//!    `as Canonical…` aliases to say which was which. Names are the contract
//!    here: a caller that picks the wrong `accept_inbound_message` writes to the
//!    wrong store, and it still compiles.
//!
//! 2. **The external actor/conversation pair has one home**, and it is
//!    `ironclaw_extension_contracts` — not `ironclaw_conversations`, which used
//!    to carry a second, field-divergent copy (`thread_id`/`message_id` versus
//!    `topic_id`/`reply_target_message_id`) that `ironclaw_assistant` bridged with
//!    hand-written field-by-field translators. Neither the second definition nor
//!    the translators may come back. This complements
//!    `reborn_extension_contract_location_scan.rs`, whose `COLLISION_EXEMPT`
//!    carve-out for the pair was **deleted** rather than repointed when the
//!    duplicate went away; this file states the outcome positively so a
//!    re-introduction fails with the reason attached.
//!
//! 3. **`ironclaw_attachments` is the one home for the attachment ports and the
//!    size ceilings.** §6.4.9 widens it to hold "the single landing routine plus
//!    its ports" and "one home for the size-ceiling constants (webui/openai
//!    import them)"; the failure mode it closes is a transport advertising one
//!    ceiling while the landing routine enforces another. So the ports and the
//!    advertised-capabilities builder must be declared there and **not** in
//!    `ironclaw_assistant`.
//!
//! **What is deliberately not asserted:** that `ProjectScopedAttachmentReader`
//! moved. It cannot. It implements `ironclaw_loop_host::LoopAttachmentReadPort`
//! as well as `InboundAttachmentReader`, and `ironclaw_loop_host` is a
//! `loops`-layer crate a `substrates` crate may not depend on — and once the
//! struct moved, that impl would have neither side in `ironclaw_assistant`, so the
//! orphan rule forbids leaving it behind too. Test 3c pins the reader *in
//! product* for that reason, so "finishing the row" cannot quietly mean moving
//! it and dragging the loop tier into a substrate.
