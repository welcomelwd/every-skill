//! Anti-slippage ratchet for the deployment-mode-name axis, the broader
//! companion to [`reborn_standalone_typename_ratchet`] (§4.4 / §10 of
//! `docs/internal/reborn/contracts/runtime-profiles.md`).
//!
//! §4.4 mandates one enforcement test: **"no public type name contains
//! `Local`/`Standalone`/`Hosted`/`Enterprise`"** — a deployment mode is a
//! `DeploymentConfig` value, never a type the kernel or a substrate names. The
//! sibling `reborn_standalone_typename_ratchet` owns the `Standalone*` shadow-runtime
//! family (shrinking to empty as Slice B lands). This ratchet owns the OTHER
//! three prefixes the doc names, which that ratchet deliberately scoped out as "a
//! separate concern":
//!
//! - `Enterprise*` — **none exist** (achieved). The empty allowlist locks that
//!   in: a new `Enterprise*` type (an `EnterpriseTierPolicy` deployment-mode
//!   leak) fails the "no new" check.
//! - `Hosted*` — the current set is all `HostedMcp*` (+ discovery/egress), a
//!   Bucket-3 **false positive**: "hosted MCP" is a real domain concept (a
//!   platform-hosted MCP server, vs a self-hosted one), NOT a `HostedDev`/hosted-
//!   TIER deployment-mode leak. Justified-keep; frozen so a genuine
//!   `HostedTierRuntime`-style leak can't slip in behind them.
//! - `Local` as a CamelCase word anywhere in the name (excluding
//!   `Standalone*`-prefixed names, owned by the sibling ratchet; localization
//!   words like `Locale`/`Localization` are excluded structurally — they
//!   continue lowercase, so the word is not `Local`). The `LocalTriggerAccess*`
//!   family is gone: §4.4 folded the `local_trigger_access` module into a
//!   config value (the `TriggerFireAccessPolicy` on `RebornRuntimeInput`,
//!   backed by config + the identity directory). The former `RebornLocal*`
//!   composition family and `LocalInvocationServicesResolver` were renamed to
//!   deployment-neutral types after their implementations stopped being
//!   local-only. New `Local*` debt still fails this ratchet.
//!
//! Scanner semantics (shared with the other §10 ratchets — see
//! [`ratchet_support`]): comments/strings stripped before matching; covers
//! `pub`/`pub(crate)`/`pub(super)`/`pub(in …)` and `unsafe`/`auto` trait
//! modifiers; skips `tests/`, `examples/`, and `benches/` trees; line-based, not
//! cfg-aware. Definition of done: the `Local*` debt shrinks to empty; the
//! `Hosted*` false positives stay (trim only if a type is genuinely deleted);
//! `Enterprise*` stays empty.
