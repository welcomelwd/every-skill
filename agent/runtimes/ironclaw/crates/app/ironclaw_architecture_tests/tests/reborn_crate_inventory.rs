//! WS10, "loud path-pattern inventory". Roughly 450 literal `crates/ironclaw_*`
//! spellings live in this directory's gates. Wave 5 moves every one of those
//! crates into a family directory, and a gate that resolves its scope with a
//! bare `root.join("crates/ironclaw_x/src")` then scans a directory that is not
//! there. The gates now spell the crate NAME and resolve the DIRECTORY, so the
//! move needs no lockstep sweep of the literals — which is only true if the
//! resolver itself is pinned, both against the rule
//! `scripts/ci/lib/crate_tree.py` states for the Python-side gates and against
//! a tree that has actually been moved.
//!
//! Every case below is paired: the property, and the sabotage that must break
//! it. A resolver that answered "no such crate" with a path matching nothing
//! would reintroduce exactly the silent-dark failure WS0 closed.
