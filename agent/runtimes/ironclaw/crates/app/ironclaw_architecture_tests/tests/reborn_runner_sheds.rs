//! WS3 runner sheds — the model gateway and progressive tool disclosure moved
//! out of `ironclaw_turn_runner` into `ironclaw_loop_host` (CHECKLIST WS4 "Runner
//! sheds", PROPOSAL §6.7.2/§6.7.3, `families/loop.md`'s loop_host charter
//! "owns … the model-gateway port adapter").
//!
//! A move is only finished when it is finished on *both* sides, so this gate
//! has four halves and each one fails for its own reason:
//!
//! 1. **Moved items are at the new home and gone from the old one.** Every
//!    symbol below is defined exactly once, in `ironclaw_loop_host`, and
//!    defined nowhere in `ironclaw_turn_runner`. A half-move that leaves a copy
//!    behind, or a re-import that recreates one, fails here rather than
//!    compiling into two divergent gateways.
//! 2. **The manifest edges the move bought are actually gone**, proved through
//!    `cargo metadata` rather than by grepping a literal path — so the WS7
//!    family move (`crates/loop/ironclaw_turn_runner/…`) cannot silently blind
//!    this scan. `ironclaw_turn_runner` no longer names `ironclaw_llm` or
//!    `ironclaw_common` under **any** dependency kind; `ironclaw_loop_host`
//!    names both.
//! 3. **The runner residue is enumerated, shrink-only, and reasoned.** What the
//!    runner still names from the moved clusters is listed with a per-entry
//!    reason. The list only shrinks.
//! 4. **The layer re-declaration that dissolved three `LAYER_MATRIX_EXCEPTIONS`
//!    stays declared.** `ironclaw_turn_runner` and `ironclaw_hooks` are `loops`.
//!    Reverting either to `kernel`/`substrates` would make three deleted
//!    exceptions necessary again, and the exception ratchet is shrink-only — so
//!    the revert must fail *here*, loudly, rather than at a confusing
//!    "undeclared edge" message three crates away.
//!
//! Scanning discipline, in the house style: production files only (via
//! `ratchet_support::production_rust_files`, which subtracts `#[cfg(test)] mod`
//! chains as well as test-shaped filenames), comments and string literals
//! stripped **before** `#[cfg(test)]` blocks (the reverse order swallows
//! production code — see the ordering guard below), every I/O error fatal, and
//! non-vacuity asserted so a broken walk can never read as a clean tree.
