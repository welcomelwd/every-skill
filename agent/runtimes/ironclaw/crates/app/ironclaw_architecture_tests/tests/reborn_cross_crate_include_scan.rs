//! §11.2.7 cross-crate `include_str!` / `include_bytes!` scan — **WARN MODE**.
//!
//! The rule (PROPOSAL §11.2 item 7): a relative include path that escapes its
//! own crate root is a compile-time reach into someone else's tree. It bypasses
//! the dependency graph the boundary tests police — `extension_host` has no
//! cargo edge to `ironclaw_extension_support`, yet it compiles that
//! crate's manifests into itself — and it silently breaks the moment either
//! crate moves, which is precisely what CHECKLIST WS7's family `git mv` does to
//! every path in the tree.
//!
//! **This scan does not fail on the inventory it finds.** Arming it as a gate
//! today would fail CI on ~60 pre-existing sites that only WS1–WS4 can fix
//! (`providers.json` becoming a crate asset, package colocation; `wit/` moved
//! into the wasm lane under WS4 and is no longer in this inventory,
//! package colocation). Warn mode makes that debt visible and countable now,
//! at WS0, so the later PRs can prove they shrank it.
//!
//! **Who flips it to enforcing:** the WS2 PR that lands CHECKLIST WS2's row
//! *"Kill the cross-crate `include_str!` reach-ins (gmail/github/nearai-mcp
//! manifests): catalog/manifest data flows from package inventory via the
//! binary; verify with the new §11.2.7 scan"* (workstream #6920, epic #3773).
//! That PR sets `REPORT_ONLY = false` below, at which point the `cross-crate`
//! findings become assertions. The `repo-root asset` half stays reported until
//! its owners land (WS1 `providers.json`; WS4 `wit/` is done), then the whole scan is
//! enforcing and this comment goes away with `REPORT_ONLY`.
//!
//! To read the inventory:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests --test reborn_cross_crate_include_scan -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! Scope: every **workspace member** package (resolved through `cargo
//! metadata`, so family moves in WS7 cannot silently narrow it), walking its
//! whole tree except `target/` and any nested package directory — a nested
//! package is scanned under its own root, or, if it is workspace-excluded
//! (the `assets/*/wasm-src` guests), not at all. The scan reads raw source:
//! it cannot strip comments the way the sibling ratchets do, because the
//! literal it needs to read *is* the string the stripper would blank. A
//! commented-out include is therefore a (harmless, warn-mode) false positive;
//! this file skips itself for that reason, since its own fixtures are made of
//! include-shaped strings.
//!
//! Not to be confused with `scripts/ci/check-include-str-paths.sh`, which is
//! already enforcing and asks a different question: does every `include_str!`
//! target *exist* and is it inside each Dockerfile's build context (the #5603
//! outage class)? A path can satisfy that and still be a boundary violation
//! here — `providers.json` exists and is COPYd, and is still a reach outside
//! `ironclaw_llm`. The two are complementary; neither subsumes the other.

// Only `workspace_root` is reachable from this binary; the type-def scanners in
// the shared module belong to the sibling ratchet binaries.
