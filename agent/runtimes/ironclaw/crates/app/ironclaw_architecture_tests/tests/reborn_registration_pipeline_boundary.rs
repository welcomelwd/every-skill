//! Registration-pipeline boundary gate.
//!
//! Hosted-MCP **registration** is its own pipeline: it validates a
//! user-supplied endpoint, authenticates to it, discovers its tools, and only
//! then hands the shared extension lifecycle a *complete* package —
//! indistinguishable from a bundled one. Everything about "registered but not
//! yet discovered" belongs inside that pipeline.
//!
//! The shared lifecycle (install → configure → activate → execute → remove)
//! runs for every extension: gmail, slack, github, telegram. It must not learn
//! registration's vocabulary. When it does, a gate built for one hosted-MCP
//! package silently changes the resting state of packages that have nothing to
//! do with MCP — the concrete failure that motivated this gate was a
//! first-party extension pinned at `setup_needed` forever by a preparation
//! check it should never have reached.
//!
//! This is the same shape as `reborn_extension_specificity.rs` and
//! `reborn_retired_taxonomy.rs`: a scanner plus a shrink-only allowlist.
//!
//! Allowlist discipline: `ALLOWLIST` enumerates today's leaked `(path, term)`
//! pairs. A new pair fails. A *stale* pair — the file no longer names the term
//! — also fails, so removing a leak forces the entry out and the list can only
//! shrink. `REGISTRATION_BOUNDARY_ALLOWLIST_BASELINE` is the other half: the
//! list cannot grow untracked either. Lower it in the same PR that deletes
//! entries so the new floor is locked in. The target is an empty list.
//!
//! # Discovery is inventory-driven, and the gate asserts it measured something
//!
//! Every scope this gate resolves — the workspace root, the files registration
//! owns, the crate excluded from its own scan — used to be keyed to the literal
//! flat `crates/<name>/` tree shape. The target architecture moves crates into
//! family directories (`crates/<family>/ironclaw_*`,
//! `docs/internal/reborn/target-architecture/PROPOSAL.md` §5), and at the first family
//! `git mv` all three stop resolving at once: `workspace_root()` walked up a
//! fixed two levels and landed on `crates/`, so the scan found no directory,
//! visited **zero files**, and reported success. Green while enforcing nothing
//! (#6963).
//!
//! So identity is anchored on the **crate name** and position on **where that
//! crate's `Cargo.toml` actually is**, at any depth. `CrateInventory` is the
//! same outermost-wins rule that `scripts/ci/lib/crate_tree.py` owns for the
//! Python-side gates — read that module for the rationale; the two are
//! deliberately recognizable as one rule.
//!
//! And discovery working is itself asserted (`measured_scan`): an inventory
//! below the floor, a scan that visited nothing, or an owned scope that
//! resolves to zero real files is an error, never a quiet pass. The last one is
//! load-bearing — WS6 retires one of the two `hosted_mcp_` scopes and the WS7
//! family move retires both, and a scope that has silently stopped matching is
//! how this gate would come back as a false positive against the registration
//! pipeline's own owner.

// Each integration-test binary compiles the shared module independently; this
// binary uses only the workspace-root search.
