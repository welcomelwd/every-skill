//! CHECKLIST WS2, row 1 — the `extension_host` port inversion
//! (PROPOSAL §6.1.3, §6.8.2, ordering constraint §12.1c).
//!
//! `ironclaw_extension_host` sits *below* product in the target tree, so a
//! product-side port it satisfies must be **defined at the product boundary**
//! (`ironclaw_product_contracts`) and implemented here — never defined in
//! `ironclaw_assistant` and reached upward. Every trait the extension host
//! implements that is still declared inside `ironclaw_assistant` is a live
//! instance of the inverted edge, and the layer flip (`products` → `loops`)
//! cannot land while any remain: the crate would not compile.
//!
//! Two halves:
//!
//! - **The residue is frozen and shrink-only.** The traits still in the wrong
//!   place are enumerated with the reason each could not move and the WS2
//!   slice that removes it. A new one fails; a stale one fails too, so the
//!   entry has to be deleted in the same change that removes the edge. That is
//!   the same update-never-relax shape as the extension-specificity allowlist.
//! - **The inverted ports are pinned where they landed.** Each port this row
//!   moved is asserted to be defined in `ironclaw_product_contracts` and
//!   implemented in `ironclaw_extension_host`, so a revert is loud rather than
//!   a silent re-inversion. (`reborn_product_contract_location_scan.rs` already
//!   pins that no *other* crate defines or re-exports them; this pins that the
//!   implementation stayed below the contract, which that scan cannot see.)
//! - **The error vocabulary is pinned too** (WS2.2). A trait is not the only
//!   way to depend upward: `ProductSurfaceFailure` was product's *internal*
//!   workflow error and simultaneously the extension host's own lifecycle error
//!   in 19 production files, which no trait-shaped rule can see. The boundary
//!   half now lives in `ironclaw_product_contracts::error`, and the files still
//!   naming product's type are frozen exact-match and shrink-only, exactly like
//!   the trait residue.

// The shared walker is compiled per test binary; each binary uses a subset.

/// that will. **Shrink-only**: adding an entry re-inverts the edge, and an
/// entry that no longer matches is deleted in the change that fixes it.
///
/// Every reason below is a *contract-purity* fact, not a preference:
/// `ironclaw_product_contracts` may depend on `ironclaw_host_api` and
/// `ironclaw_extension_contracts` and nothing else internal
/// (`reborn_dependency_boundaries.rs`), so a port whose signature names a type
/// from `ironclaw_auth`, `ironclaw_threads`, `ironclaw_turns`, or
/// `ironclaw_conversations` cannot be declared there until that type is
/// narrowed out of the signature.
///
/// **WS2.2 rewrote three of these reasons and deleted a fourth.** The row that
/// froze this list named `ProductSurfaceFailure` as the blocker on three ports;
/// that is no longer true of any of them. The boundary error moved to
/// `ironclaw_product_contracts::error::ProductOperationFailure`, so what
/// actually blocks the survivors is their *request/response* vocabulary, which
/// is what each reason now states. `ProductConversationSubjectRouteResolver`
/// had no other blocker and was inverted.
///
/// **WS2.5 then cleared every vocabulary-blocked row, 4 -> 1, and the reasons
/// above were the map that made it mechanical.** Two of the three did not need
/// their vocabulary narrowed at all: `AuthChallengeProvider` and
/// `ChannelConnectionService` were declared where their vocabulary already
/// lives (`ironclaw_auth`), which is what `.claude/rules/type-placement.md`
/// §2/§3 and `families/contracts.md:46` ask for and costs zero type
/// weakening — the residue clears when a trait stops being *product*-declared,
/// whichever legal home it lands in. The third,
/// `ProductActorUserResolver`, did move to `ironclaw_product_contracts`,
/// because the one type that blocked it (`ExternalActorBindingEpoch`) belonged
/// beside `ExternalActorRef` in `ironclaw_extension_contracts::external` all
/// along.
///
/// **The D-A factory port (§12.11) took the last one, 1 -> 0.**
/// `ProductBindingResolver` moved to `ironclaw_product_contracts::binding`
/// with `ResolveBindingRequest`, `ResolvedBinding`, and the route-kind grammar
/// that derives them — every one of those names nothing but `host_api` and
/// `extension_contracts` vocabulary, so the DTOs were never the real blocker,
/// only the fact that nobody had moved them. The error became
/// `ProductOperationFailure`, which grew the three discriminants the binding
/// path actually constructs (`BindingRequired`, `UnknownInstallation`,
/// `TurnSubmissionRejected`) rather than collapsing them — `BindingRequired`
/// in particular is what an unpaired external actor is told, and folding it
/// into `BindingResolutionFailed` would have changed that message.
///
/// **An empty list is the end state for this half, not a disabled gate.** The

/// The two halves of `cfg_test_only_files` the in-tree pin above cannot reach,
/// on a synthetic tree so nothing depends on a fixture staying put:
///
/// 1. **Direct `#[cfg(test)] mod …;` seeding.** The in-tree chain starts at
///    `e2e_tests.rs`, whose *name* already seeds it via the `*_tests.rs` rule —
///    so the seeding loop that reads the `cfg(test)` gate is never the reason
///    that chain is classified. Verified by deleting that loop: the pin above
///    stayed green. A production-named `fixture.rs` declared directly as
///    `#[cfg(test)] mod fixture;` would therefore have become countable with no
///    test failing.
/// 2. **Default (non-`#[path]`) transitive resolution.** The in-tree child is
///    reached through an explicit `#[path = "…"]`, so `resolve`'s ordinary
///    `<dir>/<name>.rs` and `<dir>/<name>/mod.rs` lookups are unexercised.
///
/// 3. **A gated module carrying a visibility qualifier**
///    (`#[cfg(test)] pub(crate) mod …;`) — the shape that actually ships in
///    `ironclaw_cli/src/runtime/mod.rs`. The backwards attribute walk
///    used to stop at `pub`, so the module read as ungated and its file stayed
///    countable as production. This half is the caller-level half: it asserts
///    through `production_rust_files`, the function the residue rows and
///    implementor pins actually consume, not only the classifier.
///
/// 4. **Walk scope.** The shared walk prunes the non-source directories
///    (`target/`, `node_modules/`) rather than only filtering them out of the
///    production list afterwards, so vendored packages can neither be counted
///    as production nor pollute the test-only set. `tests/` is deliberately
///    *not* pruned — it is excluded from counting, while the walk still reads
///    it so test-only-ness keeps propagating through it.
///
/// The first three are the shapes that let a test double keep a residue row or
/// an implementor pin satisfied after the real impl is gone. Raised by
/// @serrrfirat on #7003 and #7000.
