//! Seal enforcement for `Authorized` (arch-simplification §5.3.2; seal-placement
//! decision 2026-07-18: `host_api` type + witness token).
//!
//! `ironclaw_host_api::authorized::Authorized` can be minted only via an `AuthorizationGrant`,
//! and the only way to obtain a grant is to implement
//! `ironclaw_host_api::authorized::CapabilityAuthorizer`. Pure cross-crate type-sealing is not
//! expressible in Rust (host_api defines the type; the kernel is the sole
//! legitimate minter), so this test supplies the other half of the seal: **only
//! the kernel crate may implement `CapabilityAuthorizer`.**
//!
//! If any other production crate implements it, that crate can forge an
//! `Authorized` and dispatch an un-authorized invocation — the exact security
//! property the seal exists to prevent. Test doubles belong under `tests/`
//! (skipped here), matching the sibling ratchets' convention.
//!
//! Definition of done: when `authorize()` is wired, the ONE production impl lives
//! in `ironclaw_capabilities`; this test keeps it the only one.

// Each integration-test binary compiles the shared module independently; this
// binary uses only the comment/string stripper, so the other shared helpers
// are dead code HERE (and live in the sibling ratchet binaries).
