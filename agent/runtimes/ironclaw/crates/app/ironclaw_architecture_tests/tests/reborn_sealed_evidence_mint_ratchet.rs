//! PROPOSAL §11.2.5 — the sealed-evidence rule, as refute-tests.
//!
//! CHECKLIST WS1's evidence-mint row consolidated protocol-auth evidence
//! minting behind one witness-gated seam. This file is the *other half* of that
//! seal: every path the consolidation closed gets a test asserting it stays
//! closed. Each test below names the path it refutes.
//!
//! ## What the seal is, and why it needed replacing
//!
//! `ProtocolAuthEvidence::Verified` is the in-memory proof that host glue
//! authenticated an inbound request before it reached the product surface. It
//! used to be minted by eight `pub fn mark_*_verified*` free functions gated on
//! a `host-auth-mint` **cargo feature**.
//!
//! That gate was vacuous in every workspace build, and measurably so. Cargo
//! unifies features across the packages selected in one invocation, so
//! `ironclaw_webui`'s `ironclaw_assistant = { features = ["host-auth-mint"] }`
//! (→ `ironclaw_turns/host-auth-mint` → `ironclaw_host_api/host-auth-mint`)
//! compiled `ironclaw_host_api` **once, with the gate on**, for every other
//! crate in the same build. Measured on this row's base branch: a test in
//! `ironclaw_agent_loop` — a crate whose manifest names
//! `ironclaw_host_api` with *no* features at all — could call
//! `ironclaw_host_api::product_adapter::auth::mark_bearer_token_verified("attacker")`
//! and mint a verified bearer claim, and it compiled and passed as soon as
//! `ironclaw_webui` was named in the same `cargo test` (it correctly failed to
//! compile when `ironclaw_agent_loop` was built alone). A seal that any sibling
//! crate's manifest silently unlocks, workspace-wide, is not a seal.
//!
//! ✎ **2026-08-05 (CHECKLIST WS8):** the family is **three** functions now, not
//! eight. The five with zero callers in any build were deleted as dead mint
//! surface — every reachable mint entry point is a forgeable one, so an unused
//! one is pure liability. The paragraph above is kept as the historical
//! measurement that motivated the witness-token replacement;
//! `mark_bearer_token_verified` is one of the five and no longer exists.
//! `RETIRED_MINT_FNS` below keeps all five governed by name so a revival cannot
//! slip in outside the live census.
//!
//! The replacement is the repo's existing witness-token idiom
//! (`ironclaw_host_api::authorized`, whose companion ratchet is
//! `reborn_authorized_seal_ratchet.rs`), which is feature-independent:
//!
//! - `HostAuthenticationGrant` / `VerifiedInboundGrant` are zero-sized witnesses
//!   whose fields are private to `ironclaw_host_api`. The only source of each is
//!   the provided body of `HostProtocolAuthenticator::host_authentication_grant`
//!   and `ChannelIngressVerifier::verified_inbound_grant` respectively.
//! - Every mint entry point consumes the matching grant, so minting requires
//!   *implementing* one of those traits — a greppable, reviewable line of code
//!   rather than a feature flag in someone else's manifest.
//! - Pure cross-crate type-sealing is not expressible in Rust (the grant is
//!   defined in `ironclaw_host_api`; the legitimate minters are two other
//!   crates), exactly as `authorized.rs` records for `CapabilityAuthorizer`. So
//!   these tests supply the other half: **only the sanctioned crate may
//!   implement each trait**, and no crate may re-open a second import path to
//!   the mint family.
//!
//! Two grants, not one, because the two minters are different trust roles: the
//! host authenticator (`ironclaw_webui`) attests bearer/session evidence, and
//! the generic channel ingress verifier (`ironclaw_extension_host`) attests
//! signature/shared-secret evidence. A single grant would let either forge the
//! other's claim shape.
//!
//! ## Residual, recorded rather than hidden
//!
//! `ProtocolAuthEvidence::seal_verified_inbound` takes an `AuthRequirement`, so
//! a holder of a `VerifiedInboundGrant` could attest a bearer-shaped
//! requirement. The grant holder is the generic ingress verifier — trusted host
//! code by charter — and narrowing the parameter would mean duplicating
//! `AuthRequirement`'s channel half as a second enum. Recorded as a bounded
//! residual, not silently passed: the crate-level seam that a *package* or a
//! *product handler* cannot mint at all is the property this row exists for.
//!
//! ## The test seam, governed too (WS12 security audit, F1)
//!
//! `ProtocolAuthEvidence::test_verified` / `::test_verified_for_tenant` mint
//! verified evidence with **no grant at all**, gated only by
//! `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))]`. §12.1a's own generalizable
//! finding — a cargo feature any sibling manifest can unify on is not a
//! privilege boundary — applies to that gate verbatim: in every workspace
//! build that enables `test-support` anywhere, a production-source call to the
//! seam compiles green, and before F1 nothing scanned for it and nothing
//! pinned the feature to `[dev-dependencies]`. Closed paths #12 and #13 below
//! are the audit's two remedies: a production call site is now an offender,
//! and the feature can reach a manifest's normal dependency resolution
//! nowhere.

// Each integration-test binary compiles the shared module independently; this
// binary uses only the comment/string stripper.
