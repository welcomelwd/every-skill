//! Concrete-name specificity gate for the unified extension runtime.
// arch-exempt: large_file, unified extension specificity ratchet stays centralized, plan #6175
//!
//! Goal (docs/internal/reborn/extension-runtime/overview.md §1): no generic crate
//! contains a concrete product name, vendor id, or vendor API host. The
//! forbidden vocabulary is **derived from the bundled package inventory**
//! (`crates/extensions/packages/` plus the test fixture
//! inventory `tests/fixtures/extensions/`), so a future `discord` package is
//! caught without editing this scanner (checklist TEST-6).
//!
//! Scope: the `src/` tree and `Cargo.toml` of every generic Reborn workspace
//! crate, plus the WebUI frontend sources. Excluded, by category:
//!
//! - **Concrete extension crates** (`CONCRETE_EXTENSION_CRATES`) — they *are*
//!   the product code.
//! - **The package inventory crate** (`ironclaw_extension_support`) —
//!   it owns the concrete packages and their native executors.
//! - **Sanctioned assemblers** — `ironclaw` (the binary assembles
//!   the native factory registry; overview §4.0) and this architecture crate
//!   (names terms on purpose).
//! - **Legacy-layer / v1 crates** — the v1 enclave is being strangled
//!   wholesale, not policed term-by-term (same footing as
//!   `reborn_retired_taxonomy.rs`).
//! - **Test code** — tests may name concrete products (overview §8); `tests/`
//!   directories, `tests.rs` / `*_tests.rs` files, and `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
//!   inside `src/` are stripped before matching.
//!
//! Term-collision carve-outs (`TERM_COLLISIONS`, `PATH_TERM_COLLISIONS`):
//! some inventory-derived identifiers are *also* vocabulary of a different
//! product domain that legitimately and permanently lives in generic crates.
//! Exactly four such domains exist: LLM providers (`nearai`/`api.near.ai` is
//! the assistant's LLM+embeddings backend; Google is Gemini; GitHub is
//! Copilot), WebUI browser-login SSO providers (Google/GitHub OIDC), GitHub
//! as a skill/code host (skill installation from repositories), and
//! vendor-specific safety detection — leak/secret scanners must know
//! Slack/GitHub token shapes, and the trace payload-redaction/side-effect
//! classifier must know which tool-name keywords carry messaging/email/
//! issue-tracker payloads (a safety denylist that is a *superset* of the
//! inventory, so it cannot be sourced from the inventory without weakening
//! redaction). Bare `nearai` terms are carved out globally with the
//! compound extension forms (`nearai_mcp`, `private.near.ai`, …) still
//! scanned; the rest are path-scoped. Each carve-out names its collision and
//! fails when stale; adding one for any other reason is a violation of this
//! gate's purpose.
//!
//! Allowlist discipline (checklist TEST-7): `ALLOWLIST` enumerates today's
//! violations as exact `(path, term)` pairs. A new violating pair fails; a
//! stale pair (the file no longer matches the term) also fails, so the list
//! can only shrink. It must be **empty** by P7 (checklist DEL-8).
//!
//! Every remaining entry is **lane-4 residue** (grouped below by category with
//! a `// lane-4:` marker): a genuine generic branch, the deferred `nearai_mcp`
//! catalog slice, a one-time migration call site, the web-access assembly
//! module, an incidental doc/tool-string example, or the sanctioned DEL-7
//! dev-dependency. None is a first-party package-catalog name — Lane A cleared
//! those. Each is characterized in the PR #6065 lane-4 inventory and is the
//! owner's next decision: do NOT casually "fix" one — degenericize by routing
//! on a manifest capability, or carve deliberately with a one-line justification.

/// WS2 moved the two `[memory]` provider packages into `extensions/packages/`
/// beside the extension packages. Deriving the forbidden vocabulary from their
/// manifests as well would be wrong on both halves:
///
/// * `ironclaw.memory` and the `ironclaw.memory.*` tool ids are the
///   *provider-neutral* memory contract — the ids stay identical whichever
///   provider is bound, which is the whole point of
///   `MEMORY_PROVIDER_PACKAGE_IDS`. The kernel and the contracts crates name
///   them legitimately, so scanning them would flag the contract as vendor
///   specificity.
/// * `mem0` genuinely *is* a vendor name, and generic crates naming it
///   genuinely is debt — but that is the rule PROPOSAL §8.2 states separately
///   ("no crate outside the provider packages and the binary names a memory
///   provider"), enforced by
///   `reborn_dependency_boundaries.rs::only_the_sanctioned_residue_names_a_memory_provider`
///   with its own named, shrink-only residue. Folding it in here instead would
///   have meant raising this gate's shrink-only allowlist baseline by ~40
///   entries for debt that predates the move.
///
/// Excluding these two restores exactly the pre-move term set: before WS2 the
/// inventory was the twelve extension packages plus the fixtures, and it still

/// web surface, not a vendor, and the package is first-party deployment
/// infrastructure. Its Web Push protocol mechanics (RFC 8030/8291/8292) live
/// in the `ironclaw_web_app` domain crate the same way the provider-neutral
/// memory contract lives in `ironclaw_memory`, so composition wiring, the

    // 1. It is a **superset of the bundled inventory**, exactly like the
    //    trace-redaction classifier above. Of the eleven prefixes it carries,
    //    five belong to no installed package at all — `sk-` (OpenAI/Anthropic
    //    API keys), AWS `AKIA`/`ASIA`, JWTs (`eyJ…`), PEM private-key headers,
    //    and URI userinfo — so sourcing the set from the packages would
    //    *shrink* it and stop rejecting inline secrets the guard catches today.
    //    A guard that only knows the vendors currently installed is a guard
    //    that fails open on the next one.
    // 2. The move is **layer-illegal in the named direction**.
    //    `ironclaw_extension_registry` is `layer = "substrates"` and
    //    `crates/extensions/packages/{slack,telegram}` are `layer = "products"`,
    //    so `registry → package` is upward and needs a
    //    `LAYER_MATRIX_EXCEPTION` the ratchet forbids. The only legal shape is
    //    inversion — a package registers its prefixes with the parser — and
    //    that is strictly worse here: the guard runs while parsing an
    //    *arbitrary* manifest, including before any package is loaded, so a
    //    registration-sourced list is unpopulated exactly when it matters.
    //
    // Pinned by `inline_secret_guard_is_a_safety_denylist_not_package_inventory`

/// WS0 baseline for the extension-specificity allowlist (target-architecture

///
/// Measured 2026-07-30 against `origin/main` @ `ae0989c37` by counting the
/// entries of `ALLOWLIST` above (`ALLOWLIST.len()`, printed by the ratchet
/// below on failure).
///
/// Re-measured 2026-08-04 during the Wave 4 consolidation, and **lowered
/// 125 → 124**. The vendor-config retirement removes two net entries, which
/// against the `origin/main` this branch was first cut from (`1e2a294083`,
/// `ALLOWLIST` = 127) gave 125. #7094 then deleted a further entry on `main`
/// (127 → 126), so the same two removals now land on **124**. The count is
/// read off the ratchet's own failure message with this constant temporarily
/// set to `0`, never counted by eye — a plain paren count over the literal
/// answers 142, because the entries' comments contain parentheses too.
///
/// PROPOSAL §11.2.8 shrinks this list to the §8.1 rule-4 set and CHECKLIST
/// WS12 wants it empty. The staleness half of that discipline already lives in
/// the gate above (an entry that no longer matches fails); this ceiling is the
/// other half — the list cannot *grow* untracked either. Lower it in the same
/// PR that deletes entries so the new floor is locked in.
///
/// ✎ **129 → 125, and the gate below is now an equality (2026-08-04).**
/// Two branches found the same defect independently and this is their union;
/// the count was **recounted on the merged tree**, not taken from either side.
///
/// - **#7143 deleted an entry** — `("…/lifecycle_restore.rs", "slack")`, made
///   stale by the retired-identity branch deletion — and lowered the ceiling in
///   the same PR, which is exactly what the sentence above requires. Shipping
///   without that would have banked the deletion as slack rather than as a
///   floor.
/// - **#7147 found the ceiling was already carrying 3 entries of slack before
///   either branch.** The list held **126** pairs against a constant of 129, so
///   three earlier deletions lowered the list without lowering the ceiling —
///   silent, because a `<=` ratchet says nothing when the constant sits *above*
///   the list. Three new vendor carve-outs could have been added green.
/// - **#7147 also closed the mechanism, not just the number:** the gate below
///   is an **equality**. Slack now fails with its own message, so this cannot
///   recur — a deletion that forgets to lower the constant is a red build
///   instead of a fresh budget for the next carve-out.
///
/// Counted with a script over the entries between `const ALLOWLIST` and its
/// closing `];`, ignoring comment lines, on the **pushed ref** — not by eye and
/// not with `grep`, which also matches prose. Tracked as #7147; whichever of
/// the concurrent branches touching this list merges last must recount the
/// union rather than trusting any single branch's number.
///
/// ✎ **125 → 123 (2026-08-04, #7139 — the Wave 4 consolidation).** Neither
/// side of this merge was right for the union, so it was recounted rather than
/// picked. #7143 set **125** measuring its own branch; this branch had **124**
/// measuring its own. #7143 additionally *deleted* an entry
/// (`lifecycle_restore.rs`/`slack`) that this branch never saw, so the merged
/// list is lower than either: 126 on `main` after #7094, minus this branch's
/// two net vendor-config removals, minus #7143's one, is **123**.
///
/// Read off the ratchet's own failure message with this constant temporarily
/// set to `0` (`ALLOWLIST grew to 123 entries`) — never counted by eye, and
/// never with `grep`, which also matches prose (a paren count over the literal
/// once answered 142 because the entries' comments contain parentheses).
///
/// ⚠ **#7141 and #7152 are still open and both touch this list** (#7147).
/// Whichever merges last must recount the union the same way rather than
/// inheriting 123, 124 or 125 from any single branch.
///
/// ✎ **Union recount, 2026-08-04 (WS3/WS4 consolidation — the merge-last
/// recount #7147 asks for): the answer is 125.** Both branches lowered this
/// constant independently and each was right about its own tree — #7143
/// measured **125** after deleting the `lifecycle_restore.rs`/slack pair, and
/// the WS3/WS4 consolidation measured **126** after finding a slot of
/// pre-existing slack (129 → 127, then 126). Merging them, the union is
/// **125**: #7143's deletion is the only entry either branch removed, and the
/// WS3/WS4 work (the catalog-defaults move to `host_api`/`extensions`, the
/// `capabilities/host.rs` split) relocates code without naming a vendor, so it
/// removes no pair. The prediction going in was 124 — that both branches would
/// each contribute a deletion — and it was WRONG; the compiler said 125, which
/// is exactly why this is measured rather than reasoned. Read back the way the
/// paragraph above requires: baseline set to `0`, the ratchet's own failure
/// message reporting the length, never by eye and never with `grep` (which
/// matches prose, and once answered 142 where the truth was 124).///
/// ✎ **Union-of-unions recount, 2026-08-04 (#7139 merged to main, then main
/// merged into #7141):** per the ⚠ note above, recounted by the ratchet's own
/// failure message with the baseline set to 0 — never inherited from either
/// side (#7141's own-tree 125, #7139's 123). The ratchet reported **123**
/// — #7139's removals and #7141's repoints do not overlap on any entry.
/// The number is read off the **compiler** — set the constant to `0`, run the
/// gate, and the panic prints `ALLOWLIST.len()` — never by counting parens or
/// `grep`-ing the file, both of which also match the entry comments and the
/// prose above.
///
/// ⚠ **#7139 and #7141 also touch this list.** Whichever merges next must
/// recount on *its* merged tree and set this constant to that number in the
/// merge commit. The equality turns a stale union into a red build rather than
/// into new silent slack — which is the point — but it makes the recount
/// mandatory rather than optional.///
/// ✎ **Batch union recount, 2026-08-04 (Waves 0–4 batch: #7141+#7160+#7159+
/// #7161+#7156).** Recounted on the batch's merged tree per the mandate
/// above, by the ratchet's own failure message with the constant set to 0:
/// the batch union is **123** — #7161's conversions repoint entries in place
/// and add none.
///
/// ✎ **Union recount, 2026-08-05 (WS6 renames #7152 refreshed onto the
/// Waves 0–4 batch + the D-A factory port).** The merge-last recount the ⚠
/// notes above make mandatory. #7152 measured **125** on its own tree and the
/// incoming batch measured **122**; neither is evidence for the union, so the
/// constant was set to `0` and the true length read out of the ratchet's own
/// panic on the merged tree. Never by eye and never with `grep` — both also
/// match the entry comments and this prose. The ratchet answered **122**: the
/// batch's three vendor-pair removals (the `adapter_registry` pair repointed
/// onto `extension_registry::host_api::product_adapter`, and the
/// `config_file.rs` slack/telegram pair moved to `retired_sections.rs`) are the
/// only entries either side removed, and this branch's renames repoint entries
/// in place without adding any. So the union is the batch's number, not ours —
/// which is exactly why it is measured rather than reasoned.
///
/// **122 → 119, 2026-08-05 (WS5 `product` narrows, token-heuristics clause).**
/// The three `ironclaw_extension_registry/src/host_api/product_adapter.rs`
/// rows left the allowlist and became `PATH_TERM_COLLISIONS` carve-outs with
/// reasons. That is a re-classification, not a payment: allowlist entries are
/// *debt* — vendor names that ought to leave — and the measurement on that row
/// showed these three never can, because the guard they belong to is a safety
/// denylist that is a superset of the package inventory and the move its clause
/// named is layer-illegal besides. Keeping them in the debt column would have
/// left a permanent entry the shrink ratchet can never retire; the carve-out
/// list is where the trace-redaction classifier already records the identical
/// disposition. Net vendor-name surface is unchanged: three rows moved list,
/// zero terms appeared or vanished.
///
/// **119 → 118, 2026-08-06 (channel-generic trigger settlement delivery).**
/// The trigger-poller bridge now describes its owner as the channel delivery
/// hook instead of naming one concrete extension. The stale `slack` exception
/// was removed after the specificity scan proved the production file no
/// longer contains that vendor term.
// 118 -> 117 (2026-08-09, ephemeral-per-ping remodel): the
