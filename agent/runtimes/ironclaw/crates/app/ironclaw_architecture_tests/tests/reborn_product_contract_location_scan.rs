//! PROPOSAL §11.2.4 — the port-location rule for the **product** tier.
//!
//! Two halves, deliberately scoped differently, mirroring the extension tier's
//! scan (`reborn_product_contract_location_scan.rs`'s sibling,
//! `reborn_extension_contract_location_scan.rs`):
//!
//! - **One home.** Every type `ironclaw_product_contracts` defines must be
//!   defined nowhere else under `crates/`. Discovery, not enumeration: adding a
//!   contract to the crate enrolls it in the rule automatically.
//! - **One import path.** No crate may `pub use` one of the product tier's
//!   *ports* or the headline membrane types CHECKLIST WS1.4 names. This is the
//!   re-export-path trap: a second path for one trait is how
//!   `extension_host`, `composition`, and `product` each ended up with their own
//!   name for `ChannelAdapter` before WS1.3/WS1.4 deleted the chain.
//!
//! **Scope note — superseded 2026-08-05 by the WS5 `product` narrows row, and
//! kept because the deferral it records is now discharged in part.** It used to
//! read: *"`ironclaw_assistant` re-exports roughly 120 product value DTOs … the
//! DTO re-export sweep belongs with WS2/WS6, which repoint those crates for
//! their own reasons."* WS2 and WS6 both landed and neither took it; §6.9.1's
//! `product` narrowing row owns it, and its facade half is **executed**:
//! `crates/product/ironclaw_assistant/src/lib.rs` now declares **zero** foreign
//! `pub use` statements, pinned below by
//! [`product_declares_no_foreign_re_export_facade`]. What went was the block the
//! row names — the 148 symbols (19 `host_api::product_adapter`, 42
//! `extension_contracts`, 87 `product_contracts`) that the WS1.3/WS1.4/WS1.5
//! splits left behind when the single `host_api::product_adapter` module they
//! all came from was divided across three crates.
//!
//! **What is deliberately still not governed, and by whose ruling.** 193 further
//! foreign re-exports live in this crate's *private* modules (`reborn_services`,
//! `lifecycle`, `auth_continuation`) and reach the outside only through
//! `lib.rs`'s re-exports of those modules. They are a different population — the
//! `product_wire` / `workspace_views` / `admin_users` / `descriptors` /
//! `package_lifecycle` WebUI DTOs, none of which ever lived in
//! `host_api::product_adapter` — and they belong to a decided carve-out:
//! PROPOSAL §12.11 D-B keeps the frozen operation inventory in
//! `ironclaw_assistant` because its constants are *generic over* these DTOs, and
//! the residue is already pinned shrink-only as
//! `WEBUI_PRODUCT_SYMBOL_BASELINE` in `reborn_transport_product_boundary.rs`
//! (the `webui` row's residue, with its own owner). Widening this scan onto them
//! would contradict D-B rather than enforce it.
//!
//! What the import-path rule exists to protect is the *ports* — the traits whose
//! implementation site is the whole reason the crate exists — and those are
//! governed here with zero exemptions: `ProductSurface`,
//! `ChannelInboundProductSurface`, and `ProjectionStream` each had exactly one
//! re-export chain at WS1.4, and all three are deleted.
//!
//! **A collision this scan can see and the extension tier's cannot.**
//! `ProductSurfaceKind` and `ProductAdapterError` stay in `ironclaw_host_api`
//! (`product_adapter::identity` / `product_adapter_error`) even though they
//! read like product-tier names. That is not an oversight: `host_api` may hold
//! no internal dependency, and `host_api::user_identity` names
//! `AdapterInstallationId` from the same module while `host_api`'s own
//! `product_adapter::auth` names `ProductAdapterError`. Both tiers reach them
//! downward, which is the only placement that serves both. They are therefore
//! not defined in this crate and this scan never sees them.

// This scan uses the shared type-def walker and workspace-root helper; the
// other helpers in the shared module are unreachable from this binary (each
// test binary compiles the whole module and uses a different subset).
