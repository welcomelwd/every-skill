//! Shared scanner machinery for the §10 anti-slippage ratchets.

//! visibility (`pub(crate)`/`pub(super)`/`pub(in …)`), optional `unsafe`/`auto`
//! modifiers, occurrence-preserving scans (same-file duplicates stay visible),
//! and a production-scoped walk (skips `target/`, `tests/`, `examples/`,

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `#[cfg(test)]` removal — TWO scanners, deliberately, because the callers ask
// two different questions (CHECKLIST WS10, the scanner-consolidation row).
//
// The row that ordered this consolidation described "one `strip_cfg_test_blocks`"
// maintained in four copies. Measured on this tree the copies are **six**
// spellings in **two semantic families**, and collapsing the families onto one
// body would silently change two gates' verdicts:
//
//   * [`strip_cfg_test_blocks`] — the *byte-scanning* family (four byte-identical
//     copies: the two port-inversion gates, `reborn_runner_sheds`,
//     `reborn_transport_product_boundary`, plus `reborn_registration_pipeline_
//     boundary`'s `strip_cfg_test`, which was the same body missing one guard).
//     It finds the marker ANYWHERE and brace-balances, so it is only sound on
//     source whose comments and string literals are already blanked. Its callers
//     all compose it as `strip_cfg_test_blocks(&strip_comments_and_strings(src))`.
//
//   * [`strip_line_anchored_cfg_test_items`] — the *line-anchored* family (two copies:
//     `reborn_extension_specificity`, `reborn_manifest_reparse_gate`). Its
//     callers scan **raw** source on purpose — the specificity gate treats a
//     vendor name in a comment as a violation, and the reparse gate filters
//     comment lines itself afterwards — so they cannot pre-strip. Feeding raw
//     source to the byte-scanning family would let a `#[cfg(test)]` written
//     inside a doc comment or a string literal swallow real production code:
//     the fail-OPEN direction, and the one this whole directory exists to stop.
//
// Two names, one implementation each, and the difference is documented rather
// than discovered again by the next reader.

// Crate inventory: the Rust half of the WS10 path-keying rule
//
// Every gate in this directory that names a crate spells it the flat way —
// `crates/ironclaw_llm/src/lib.rs`. The family move (`crates/<family>/…`,
// PROPOSAL §5) makes that spelling false for ~60 crates at once, and a gate
// that resolves it with a bare `root.join(…)` then either scans a directory
// that is not there or asserts against an allowlist nothing can match.
//
// The rule these helpers implement is the one `scripts/ci/lib/crate_tree.py`
// states for the Python-side gates, so the two inventories agree by
// construction and `reborn_crate_inventory.rs` pins them equal:
//
//   * a crate directory is the OUTERMOST directory under `crates/` owning a
//     `Cargo.toml`;
//   * a manifest declaring its own `[workspace]` table is the root of a
//     DIFFERENT workspace (the six `wasm-src` guests) and is not a crate of
//     this one;
//   * `target/` and dotted directories are skipped;
//   * fewer than `MIN_CRATE_DIRECTORIES` results is a broken checkout, not an
//     answer — refuse rather than let a gate report success on an empty scan.
//
// A gate keeps its literal, readable `crates/<crate>/…` spelling and resolves
// it through `crate_path`; the literal becomes a crate NAME plus an in-crate
// remainder rather than a directory path. On today's flat tree resolution is
// the identity, which is what makes adopting it a behavior-free change.
