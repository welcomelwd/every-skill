//! Static ratchet for test-only and dead-code struct members in production
//! source.
//!
//! Production structs should not grow fields or methods that exist only to
//! support tests, and they should not grow dead-code-suppressed members. The
//! current tree has existing examples (mostly composition/runtime test seams),
//! so this test freezes the per-file inventory by category and member kind. A
//! new occurrence fails by increasing a path count; removing one should shrink
//! the matching baseline entry in the same PR.

/// measured **on this checkout**, not copied from the design docs.
///
/// Measured 2026-07-30 against `origin/main` @ `ae0989c37` from
/// `FROZEN_PATH_COUNTS` below — 82 frozen `(category, kind, path)` entries
/// totalling 283 suppressed members (both printed by the assertion at the end
/// of the gate below on failure). Lowered to 81/282 by the **WS8** dead-module
/// deletion (#6943), which removed
/// `event_projections/src/pending_gate_projection.rs` and its one
/// test-support method. Lowered again to **80/277** by **WS1.5**, which
/// deleted all five `dead-code` suppressions in
/// `host_api/src/product_adapter/auth.rs`: they existed only because the mint
/// family's constructors were `#[cfg(feature = "host-auth-mint")]`, so a
/// feature-off build saw them as unreachable. Witness-gated minting compiles
/// unconditionally, so the constructors have real callers in every build and
/// the suppressions are not merely moved — they are unnecessary. The file's
/// two `test-support` methods (`test_verified`/`test_verified_for_tenant`)
/// stay and keep their entry. (The `WS0_` prefix records when the baseline was
/// *captured*, by #6936; deletions that lower it come from WS8 and, here,
/// WS1.5.)
///
/// The per-path checks already refuse growth *within* a listed file and refuse
/// staleness. These two totals close the remaining door: adding a **new** path
/// entry to the frozen list — the one way debt can legitimately grow — now has
/// to move a recorded number, so it is a reviewed decision rather than one
/// more line in a long list. Both only ever move down; lower them in the same
/// PR that deletes debt (CHECKLIST WS8 flips `dead_code`/`unreachable_pub` on
/// workspace-wide once this inventory is gone).
///
/// ✎ **80/277 → 79/276 (2026-08-04, #7147), and the totals check below is now
/// an equality.** "Both only ever move down; lower them in the same PR that
/// deletes debt" was honour-system, and it had already been skipped once: a
/// `<=` ratchet is silent when the constant sits *above* the inventory, so the
/// tree carried **one frozen path and one member of untracked slack** — enough
/// for a whole new frozen dead-code path with one suppressed member to be
/// appended and every gate stay green. That is precisely the growth this
/// totals check exists to catch, and it could not see it. Recounted on
/// `origin/main` @ `676d86ce02` by zeroing both constants and reading the
/// panic (which prints `FROZEN_PATH_COUNTS.len()` and the member sum), not by
/// eye: **79 paths / 276 members**. Lowered to **79/274** across two steps: the sandbox
/// profile wiring made `RebornRuntimeStores::capability_policy` production-used instead of
/// test-support-only, then #7171 did the same for the skill mount view once
/// `skill_mounts_for` began deriving it per gate.
