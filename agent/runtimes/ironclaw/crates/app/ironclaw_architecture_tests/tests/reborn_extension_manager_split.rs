//! CHECKLIST WS2 — the `ironclaw_extension_manager` split
//! (PROPOSAL §6.8.2 / §6.8.3).
//!
//! `ironclaw_extension_host` held two jobs at once: lifecycle **authority**
//! (the only writer of installation state and the active snapshot, ingress
//! verification, activation transactions) and the extension-management
//! **product face** that arrived with #6616/#6669 (lifecycle capabilities and
//! commands, the `LifecycleProductService`, admin/operator/skill capability
//! handlers, credential views, the extension hub). §6.8.3 splits the second
//! job into its own `products`-layer crate so the first can move *below*
//! product in WS2's layer flip.
//!
//! The split only buys that if the dependency runs one way. Three halves:
//!
//! - **The host never depends on the manager.** Checked at the manifest *and*
//!   at the source level, because a `#[cfg(test)]`-only or dev-dependency
//!   cycle would still be a cycle in the graph the layer flip has to satisfy.
//!   This is the load-bearing rule: if it breaks, the manager stops being a
//!   layer above and becomes a sibling with a back-edge.
//! - **Each half kept its own job.** The authority modules are still in the
//!   host and the product-face modules are only in the manager, so a later
//!   change cannot quietly drag a surface back across the line — in either
//!   direction.
//! - **The manager's residual `ironclaw_assistant` coupling is frozen and
//!   shrink-only.** `families/extensions.md` says the manager never depends on
//!   the conversation-facing product crate. It does today, in exactly seven
//!   files, and every one of them is a *product DTO or capability-id constant*
//!   that §6.1.3 assigns to `product_contracts` — not a workflow call. The
//!   list names the row that removes each, and a stale entry fails, so the
//!   edge can only get smaller.

// The shared walker is compiled per test binary; each binary uses a subset.
