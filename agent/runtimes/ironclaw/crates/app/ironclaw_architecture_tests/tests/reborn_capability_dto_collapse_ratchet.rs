//! Anti-slippage ratchet for the capability-path DTO collapse (§3/§9/§10 of
//! `docs/internal/reborn/contracts/capability-access.md`).
//!
//! §1.1 showed a single capability call re-wrapped through ~5 near-identical
//! request shapes plus an overloaded ten-variant result enum. §3 collapses those
//! onto the `host_api` vocabulary (`Invocation`/`Authorized`/`Resolution`). §9 is
//! explicit that during the migration the type count *rises before it falls*
//! (~14 → ~18 → ~11) while the new vocabulary and the old shapes coexist, and
//! that **"the §10 mirror-DTO ratchet's allowlist is what makes this safe: the
//! old [shapes] are frozen entries that may only disappear."**
//!
//! The collapse COMPLETED (#6447 retired the last request DTOs), so this file
//! is no longer the shrinking freeze that §9 describes — it is the permanent
//! zero-gate that survives it: [`RETIRED_COLLAPSE_DTOS`] names the retired
//! mirror shapes, and the test fails if any of them is ever re-declared
//! (the exact §1.1 Mechanism 1 failure, attempted after the fact).
//!
//! Two of the ten originally-frozen names are deliberately NOT here:
//! `CapabilityOutcome` (deleted by #6299 before the retired-list conversion)
//! and `CapabilityDispatchRequest` (its removal was a blessing, not a
//! deletion — it survives as the canonical port type in
//! `ironclaw_host_api::dispatch`). Reintroducing the former fires nothing;
//! add it below if that ever becomes a live hazard.
//!
//! Scanner semantics (shared with the other §10 ratchets — see
//! [`ratchet_support`]): comments/strings stripped before matching; covers
//! `pub`/`pub(crate)`/`pub(super)`/`pub(in …)`; skips `tests/`/`examples/`/
//! `benches/`; line-based, not cfg-aware.
