//! PROPOSAL §11.2.4 — port-location scan for the extension tier.
//!
//! A contract's *definition* lives in the crate that owns it; its
//! *implementations* live wherever the behavior does. For the extension tier
//! that owner is `ironclaw_extension_contracts` (PROPOSAL §6.1.2,
//! `families/contracts.md`), and the rule has two halves:
//!
//! 1. **One home per contract.** No other crate defines a type or trait with a
//!    governed name. A second same-named definition is a shadow contract: two
//!    crates then disagree about what an installation state or a channel
//!    descriptor *is*, and nothing catches it at compile time because nobody
//!    has to import the other one.
//! 2. **One import path per contract.** No crate re-exports one. That is the
//!    re-export-path trap §11.2.4 names, and the extension tier had three live
//!    instances of it before WS1.3: `ironclaw_assistant` re-exported
//!    `PreferenceTargetCodec` from `host_api` and
//!    `ironclaw_composition` re-exported it again from *product*, so
//!    `ironclaw_telegram_extension` imported the trait through
//!    `ironclaw_assistant` (and carried a forbidden product dependency to do it)
//!    while `ironclaw_slack_extension` imported the same trait from
//!    `ironclaw_host_api`; and `ironclaw_extension_host::state` re-exported
//!    `InstallationState` beside `AuthAccountState` "so they stay
//!    discoverable together", which made `crate::InstallationState` a second
//!    path used inside that crate's own modules.
//!
//! **The two halves have deliberately different scopes.**
//!
//! * *One home* covers **every** type the crate defines, discovered rather than
//!   enumerated, so a new contract cannot be added without inheriting it. It
//!   passes today with no exemptions: nothing else in the workspace defines any
//!   of these names.
//! * *One import path* covers the crate's **traits plus the value types
//!   CHECKLIST WS1.3 names** — which is exactly §11.2.4's own scope ("adapter /
//!   surface / loop-port traits pinned to their owner; no cross-crate `pub use`
//!   of them"). The crate's `Lifecycle*` projection vocabulary is deliberately
//!   out of scope: PROPOSAL §6.1.3 assigns `package_lifecycle` to
//!   `ironclaw_product_contracts`, so `ironclaw_assistant`'s re-export of it is
//!   vocabulary heading *toward* that crate, not away from its owner, and WS1.4
//!   settles it. The two `as Reborn*` aliases in `product::reborn_services`
//!   (`RebornChannelConnectStrategy`, `RebornChannelConfigField`) are a second
//!   *name*, not just a second path; retiring the `Reborn*` prefix is CHECKLIST
//!   WS10's type-name row and is not smuggled in here.
//!
//! **Macro-generated refs are invisible to both halves, and one of them
//! collides.** `bounded_lifecycle_string!` declares `LifecyclePackageRef`,
//! `LifecyclePackageId`, and `LifecycleBlockerRef` as `pub struct $name`, which
//! no `pub struct` walk can resolve. That matters beyond coverage:
//! `ironclaw_auth::ids` declares its **own** `LifecyclePackageRef`
//! (`validated_string!`, `src/ids.rs:188`) beside `package_lifecycle`'s, so the
//! workspace carries two same-named types for one concept and this scan can see
//! neither. Recorded rather than silently passed — unifying them is a domain
//! change (auth's flow records persist its own), not a contracts extraction.
