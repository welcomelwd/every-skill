//! Positive + negative fixtures for the **shared** source scanners in
//! `ratchet_support` (CHECKLIST WS10, the scanner-consolidation row).
//!
//! Why this binary exists. The row that ordered the consolidation ends with the
//! rule that makes it safe: *"the consolidated helpers land with their own
//! positive/negative fixtures, since every gate's non-vacuity then depends on
//! them."* Before consolidation a syntax shape each copy mishandled cost one
//! gate; now it costs every gate at once, so the shared bodies need fixtures
//! that are **not** owned by any single gate — a gate can be deleted, and its
//! fixtures with it, long after twenty other gates started depending on the
//! helper it was proving.
//!
//! `ratchet_support` itself cannot hold them: it is a `mod` compiled into ~37
//! separate integration-test binaries, so a `#[test]` there would be collected
//! and run 37 times and would report a helper regression 37 times over.
//!
//! (An earlier version of this comment claimed the `reborn_*` FILE name puts
//! this binary in `code_style.yml`'s `cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests
//! reborn` smoke lane. It does not: that argument is a TEST-NAME filter — the
//! sibling `reborn_contracts_vendor_census.rs` documents the measurement — and
//! none of this file's `#[test]` fns carries the substring, so the smoke lane
//! runs 0 of them. These fixtures run in the reborn-tests full plan, which is
//! the lane that matters; noted here so nobody trusts the file name for lane
//! coverage again.)
//!
//! **Two `#[cfg(test)]` strippers, deliberately.** The measurement that
//! motivated splitting them is in `ratchet_support`'s own module comment; what
//! this file adds is the fixture proving each family behaves the way its
//! callers depend on, *including* the shape the other family gets wrong.
