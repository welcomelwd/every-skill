//! WS0 baseline record for the target-architecture restructure (epic #3773,
//! workstream #6920 — `docs/internal/reborn/target-architecture/CHECKLIST.md` WS0).
//!
//! CHECKLIST WS0 names five ratchets that must not regress while the
//! restructure runs. Three of them are recorded beside the test that owns the
//! list being measured, because there the constant and the data are in one
//! file and cannot drift apart:
//!
//! | baseline | recorded in |
//! |---|---|
//! | `LAYER_MATRIX_EXCEPTIONS` count (WS0 20) | `reborn_dependency_boundaries.rs` |
//! | extension-specificity allowlist size (WS0 130) | `reborn_extension_specificity.rs` |
//! | production-struct dead-code inventory (WS0 82 paths / 283 members) | `reborn_struct_test_support_ratchet.rs` |
//!
//! Only the WS0 records are quoted above. The live values are the owning
//! files' constants and ratchet down as waves land; a "now N" quoted in this
//! header rotted unnoticed (it read "now 15" while the live register was 6),
//! so this file no longer carries one — one definition per metric, owned by
//! the gate that enforces it, applies to the prose too.
//!
//! The remaining two — composition mass and the integration-coverage floor —
//! are enforced by shell gates over committed manifests, wired into CI
//! (`code_style.yml` → `scripts/ci/check-composition-budget.sh`,
//! `reborn-tests.yml` → `scripts/ci/reborn-coverage-ratchet.sh`). This file
//! records their WS0 values and pins that those gates stay **armed**: a
//! ratchet quietly flipped to dry-run, or a manifest moved out from under a
//! path-keyed gate, is exactly how the restructure would regress unobserved
//! (the failure mode CHECKLIST WS10 flags for every path-keyed gate).
//!
//! It deliberately does **not** re-implement either metric. One definition per
//! metric, owned by the gate that enforces it; a second implementation here
//! would drift and then lie.
//!
//! Every number below was measured from this checkout with the command
//! recorded beside it — never copied from the design documents. To print the
//! WS0-vs-today report:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests --test reborn_restructure_baselines -- --nocapture
//! ```

// Only `workspace_root` is reachable from this binary; the scanners in the
// shared module belong to the sibling ratchet binaries.
