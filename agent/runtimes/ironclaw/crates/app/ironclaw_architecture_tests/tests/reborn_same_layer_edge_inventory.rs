//! Same-layer dependency inventory — the guard the layer matrix cannot be
//! (target-architecture epic #3773, CHECKLIST WS10; issue #7149).
//!
//! # The hole
//!
//! `layer_allows_dependency` in `reborn_dependency_boundaries.rs` is
//! **reflexive**: every layer permits itself. So an edge between two crates in
//! the same layer is legal by construction, no exception entry is required,
//! and `LAYER_MATRIX_EXCEPTIONS` never sees it. Measured on `origin/main`
//! @ `676d86ce02`: **391 workspace normal edges, 73 of them same-layer** — and
//! that count sat flat across the entire restructure while the *reported*
//! exception count fell 20 → 6. (**70** on the merged tree at `acbf1d89e8`;
//! #7143's `host_ingress` re-layer took three of them cross-layer, and the
//! stale-row half of this gate is what named all three.) The improvement was real; it was also
//! measuring a category that excludes most of the coupling. Every same-layer
//! pair that is not yet an edge is silently addable:
//! `ironclaw_assistant → ironclaw_webui` compiles and passes the whole
//! architecture suite today.
//!
//! # The instrument
//!
//! [`SAME_LAYER_EDGE_INVENTORY`] is that missing default guard, built to the
//! same shape as `LAYER_MATRIX_EXCEPTIONS`:
//!
//! 1. **Complete.** Every live same-layer edge must be inventoried. A 74th is
//!    a red build, which is the property the layer matrix cannot provide.
//! 2. **Not stale.** An inventoried edge that no longer exists is a red build,
//!    so deletions are banked rather than left as headroom.
//! 3. **Shrink-only, both directions.** The count is pinned by an equality.
//!    Growth is new coupling; slack is an unclaimed budget for it — the exact
//!    defect #7147 found in two other ratchets on this same tree.
//! 4. **Tracked.** Every entry names an owner and the workstream that decides
//!    its disposition, and placeholders count as missing.
//!
//! ⚠ **What `decided_in` does and does not claim.** It is *not* a promise that
//! every inventoried edge is scheduled for deletion. Same-layer edges are
//! legal by the matrix and some are permanent by charter — a provider
//! implementing its own contract (`memory_native → memory`), the contracts
//! family's internal vocabulary (`product_contracts → host_api`). The field
//! names the workstream that owns the **consumer** crate's family and will make
//! that call, taken from CHECKLIST's own workstream headings. What the
//! inventory guarantees is narrower and enforceable: no same-layer edge appears
//! without a reviewer seeing it, and the total cannot drift upward.
//!
//! # The second rule: a downward re-layer needs a consumer-side pin
//!
//! Moving a crate *down* a layer widens who may reach it, and the layer matrix
//! by construction reports that widening as an improvement. #7143 demoted
//! `ironclaw_host_ingress` to `substrates` with no such pin, leaving it
//! reachable by every crate above `substrates` with nothing objecting —
//! and when that PR merged into this branch, the rule below went red on it
//! by name and the pin was supplied here.
//! [`CRATE_LAYER_ORIGINS`] makes the trigger mechanical rather than
//! remembered: each crate's **first** declared layer is frozen, so a live layer
//! below it is a permanent, detectable demotion, and the gate then demands a
//! [`DowngradePin`] whose frozen consumer set is enforced on every commit.
//!
//! Both origin rows were derived from `git log`, not assumed: across all 67
//! layered crates exactly one downward re-layer has ever happened
//! (`ironclaw_extension_registry` `loops` → `substrates`, #7094 / WS2), alongside two
//! promotions (`hooks` `substrates` → `loops`, `runner` `kernel` → `loops`)
//! which need no pin because moving up narrows reach.
//!
//! ✎ **That census is a snapshot of when this gate was authored and is no
//! longer the live count — read [`DOWNGRADE_PINS`], not this paragraph.** Three
//! more demotions have landed since: `ironclaw_host_ingress` `products` →
//! `substrates` (#7143, the move that motivated the rule), `ironclaw_skills`
//! `loops` → `substrates` (#7141 / WS4), and `ironclaw_extension_support`
//! `loops` → `runtimes` (WS3 closeout). The last of those is worth naming here
//! because it is the first demotion taken *for* the exception register rather
//! than alongside it: it deleted `LAYER_MATRIX_EXCEPTIONS`' final entry, so the
//! consumer-side pin is now the only structural check standing over that edge.
//! Kept as four rows rather than folded into a count, since a pin's whole value
//! is naming who may reach the demoted crate.
//!
//! ⚠ **Every test function here must keep its `reborn_` prefix.** The file name
//! is not what selects it: `code_style.yml` runs
//! `cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests reborn`, and that argument is a **test
//! name** filter, not a path filter. Written without the prefix these gates
//! compiled, passed locally, and reported `running 0 tests` under the exact
//! command CI uses — inert in one of the two lanes that run them, which is the
//! failure mode this whole file exists to stop. Verified by running that command
//! and reading the count.
