You are running **ONE iteration** of the IronClaw **Reborn de-slop** loop. Take exactly one **Reborn
crate** (in `crates/`) that has **not been de-slopped yet**, review it *deeply and from multiple
angles using parallel sub-agents*, then **land one coherent PR** that fixes the findings —
simplifications, refactors, contract/README/invariant corrections, and any **missing unit/integration
tests** needed to keep the component correct forever. Then **STOP** — a human merges. Do not merge
anything.

Unlike `/review-crate` (a read-only audit) and `/review-pr` (which reviews an open PR's diff), this
loop reviews a **whole crate as it stands on the integration branch** and improves it. The unit of
work is a **Reborn crate**, not a diff.

If the user passed a crate name as an argument (`$ARGUMENTS`, e.g. `ironclaw_turns`), de-slop **that**
crate and skip the selection cascade in §1 — but still run the §1 Reborn/legacy check to confirm it is
a legitimate Reborn target. Otherwise pick one per §1.

## 0. Environment & state
- **Reborn-only.** All work targets the Reborn stack in `crates/` (root AGENTS.md, "Purpose and
  precedence"). The v1 `src/` monolith and its legacy enclave
  (`ironclaw_engine`, `ironclaw_tui`, `ironclaw_gateway`, `ironclaw_oauth`) have all been removed,
  so every crate under `crates/` that the workspace builds is a legitimate target. Two caveats you can check in the root `Cargo.toml`: `tools/ironclaw_silk_decoder`
  is in `exclude`, so workspace-wide `cargo` commands never see it; and a crate with no consumers
  may be queued for deletion rather than for de-slopping (`grep -rl --include=Cargo.toml "<crate>"
  crates/ Cargo.toml` — the family layout means `crates/*/Cargo.toml` matches nothing). Verify each
  candidate's status with the orientation recipe (§1) before picking it.
- **Local gate reality.** You can prove `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, per-crate `cargo test -p <crate>`,
  the workspace unit-test tier, and the architecture-boundary test (`cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests`)
  locally. The **backend-integration tier** (crate-level feature-gated suites, e.g.
  `cargo test -p ironclaw_hooks --features integration` — the workspace-root `integration` feature is
  empty and does nothing) needs Docker for its Postgres testcontainers;
  the **live tier** (`-- --ignored`) needs Postgres + LLM API keys; **Reborn e2e**
  (`scripts/reborn-e2e-rust.sh`) may need Docker. If a fix touches those paths, implement it fully and
  mark the gate **"CI-deferred (needs Postgres/Docker/keys)"** in the PR body. Never weaken or delete
  integration/e2e coverage just because it can't run in this environment. (Tiers: `.claude/rules/testing.md`.)
- Read `.work/deslop-ledger.md` (create the file and `.work/` dir if missing; add `.work/` to
  `.gitignore` if it isn't already — the ledger is local scratch, keep it out of PRs). The
  **DESLOPPED** list records crates this loop has already passed through — **skip them** so two
  iterations don't re-chew the same crate. Also run `gh pr list` to see in-flight PRs: **don't pick a
  crate an open PR is actively reshaping** (you would collide on the same files); prefer a crate no
  open PR holds.

## 1. Pick ONE un-de-slopped Reborn crate — stop at first viable
List the crates (`ls crates/*/` — the top level is the ten family directories, crates are one level
down, plus `crates/extensions/packages/*`). A crate is a **candidate** when ALL hold:
- **it has real consumers.** Verify: `grep -rl --include=Cargo.toml "<crate_name>" crates/ Cargo.toml`
  — the legacy enclave is gone (every workspace crate is Reborn), so this check now exists to catch
  crates with no consumers that may be queued for deletion instead. When unsure,
  consult the `ironclaw-reborn-orientation` skill.
- **not already in the ledger DESLOPPED list** (§0),
- **not the hot surface of an open PR** (§0) — leave those to the build/review loops,
- it has real source to review (skip thin aggregator/facade crates with ~no `src` — though their
  *tests* are fair game for the coverage angle).

**Selection bias:** prefer **smaller / leaf crates first** — they fit entirely in context, gate
cleanly, and merge independently. A crate whose `src` is **under ~2k lines** can and SHOULD be read in
full (§3). Clear the small, high-leverage crates before taking on the giants (e.g.
`ironclaw_composition`, `ironclaw_assistant`, `ironclaw_extension_host`-scale surfaces need
targeted reading, not a full load, and may warrant splitting the de-slop across iterations
module-by-module). When unsure, prefer a crate that is **load-bearing for invariants** (turns,
dispatcher, authorization, approvals, secrets, run_state, event store) over a purely mechanical one —
a slop fix there protects the whole system.

If **every** Reborn crate is ledger-recorded or PR-held, this is a **no-de-slop iteration**: record
"nothing to de-slop" in the ledger and STOP. Do **not** manufacture a marginal PR to fill the gap.

## 2. FENCES (hard)
- **De-slop the crate — do not redesign its feature or change its observable contract.** Your mandate
  is quality (structure, decomposition, spaghetti, abstraction, file size), **interface hygiene**
  (public surface not over-exposed; `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`CONTRACT.md`/`README.md` accurate),
  **invariant integrity**, and **test coverage** — not re-scoping what the crate does. If you conclude
  the crate's *premise* or *layer* is wrong, **file a GitHub issue** with the verdict (§6 "Deferred
  findings") and STOP — don't silently rewrite it into something else. When a change would add a trait, a
  crate, a dependency edge, or a re-export, apply the `ironclaw-reborn-architecture-review` skill first.
- **Respect the Reborn layering.** Product/runtime composition flows **downward** through typed
  contracts (`crates/AGENTS.md` → "Dependency Mental Model"). Never introduce an upstream dependency in
  a lower-level crate to make a fix convenient — `cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests` enforces the
  boundaries and will fail. A de-slop that needs a new upward edge is out of scope; record it (§9).
- **Scope = ONE coherent, single-crate PR.** If the crate is huge and the findings sprawl, do the
  **smallest self-contained slice** (one module / one invariant / one test gap) and record the rest in
  the ledger for the next iteration. Never open a sprawling multi-thousand-line refactor PR. Prefer
  **deleting** complexity over accreting layers.
- **Privacy & logging doctrine (root AGENTS.md security invariants + the REPL rule in root CLAUDE.md — hard blockers).**
  - **Never add a log line that prints a prompt, completion, key material, decrypted content, secret,
    or raw bytes** — log ids/counts/sizes/durations/error-types only. Treat any such existing line you
    find as a finding and fix it.
  - **`info!`/`warn!` corrupt the REPL/TUI.** Background tasks (reflection, trace analysis, heartbeat)
    must NEVER use `info!`. Use `debug!` for internal diagnostics; reserve `info!` for user-facing
    status the REPL intentionally renders. Flag and fix violations.
  - **LLM data is never deleted.** Context, reasoning, tool calls, messages, events, and steps are the
    most valuable data in the system. Never strip, truncate, or delete them from the database; a
    "simplification" that drops retained LLM data is a blocker, not a fix. In-memory caches may be
    evicted; the database is the source of truth.
- **Production-code conventions (root AGENTS.md).** No `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` outside `#[cfg(test)]`;
  errors via `thiserror` with context; `crate::` imports (not `super::`) in non-test code; multi-line
  prompt templates live in `prompts/*.md` loaded via `include_str!()`, never inline Rust constants. A
  de-slop that *introduces* any of these is a self-inflicted finding — reject it (§6 guard).

## 3. Load the crate & branch
- Read the crate's guidance in order: `crates/<crate>/AGENTS.md`, then `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRACT.md`,
  `README.md` (note the absence of an expected one as a finding), then `Cargo.toml` (deps, features,
  `pub` surface) and `src/lib.rs`/`src/main.rs` to map the module tree. Pull the matching
  `docs/internal/reborn/contracts/*.md` if the crate has a cross-crate contract.
- **Small crate (`src` < ~2k lines): read every source file in full** so the review is complete, not
  sampled. **Large crate: read the guidance, the public API (`lib.rs` re-exports), the `CONTRACT.md`,
  and the largest / hottest modules**, and scope the PR to the slice you fully understand (§2).
- Branch off the freshest integration base: `git fetch origin && git switch -c deslop/<crate-short-name> origin/main`
  (e.g. `deslop/turns`). Confirm it builds before you start (`cargo build -p <crate> --all-targets`).
  The repo's PR target is **`main`** — you will `gh pr create --base main` in §8 (confirm against
  the base shown by the repo config if unsure).

## 4. Fan out the review — PARALLEL sub-agents (this is the core of the loop)
Spawn the following review sub-agents **concurrently** (issue them in a single message so they run in
parallel via the Agent tool). Give **each** sub-agent the crate path, tell it to **read the crate's
source itself**, and require it to return a **prioritized, structured findings list** where every
finding names the **file/lines**, the **smell**, and a concrete **remedy** (not just the smell). Run
**at least** these four angles:

1. **Thermo-nuclear quality reviewer.** Instruct it: *read
   `.claude/skills/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review/SKILL.md` and apply it verbatim to the entire
   crate as if it were one large diff* (the skill is `disable-model-invocation`, so it must follow the
   rules directly, not try to invoke it). Hunt for **code-judo** reframings that delete whole
   branches/helpers/modes; flag any file over ~1k lines that should be decomposed; flag ad-hoc
   conditionals, thin wrappers, needless optionality/casts, dead/speculative branches, canonical-helper
   duplication, and logic in the wrong layer. Output in the skill's priority order.

2. **Paranoid senior architect.** Tell it to first read the `ironclaw-reborn-architecture-review`
   skill (`.claude/skills/ironclaw-reborn-architecture-review/SKILL.md`) so its abstraction/boundary
   judgments match this repo, then give it this prompt framed at the whole crate:
   > You are a paranoid senior engineer and architect on IronClaw Reborn. A junior engineer has shipped
   > this crate as if it were a single pull request, and your job is to carefully review it for
   > **correct architecture, completeness, and security**, and to ensure that **testing covers all edge
   > cases and exercises the whole wiring — not just local unit tests**. Check that the crate sits at
   > the right layer, adds no unjustified trait/dependency/re-export, and never reaches upstream. Where
   > the code is a **bug-fix-shaped** pattern, ensure this *whole class* of problem can never recur.
   > Where it is a **feature**, ensure there will be **no future bug reports** against it. Enumerate
   > concrete gaps (missing error handling, unhandled edge cases, race/replay/overflow hazards,
   > security/privacy leaks, partial-state/atomicity bugs, integration paths never exercised
   > end-to-end) with file/line and the fix or the test that would close them.

3. **Interface / contract / invariants auditor.** Instruct it to verify: the **public API is not
   over-exposed** (every `pub`/`pub(crate)` item that doesn't need to be public should be tightened —
   flag leaked internals, `pub` fields that should be private, types re-exported needlessly); the
   crate's **guidance is accurate** (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`CONTRACT.md`/`README.md` document the real
   purpose, public surface, and core invariants — flag drift between guidance and code, and any missing
   file the crate should have); and the crate's **core invariants actually hold** in code (find the
   documented/implied invariants and check each is enforced at its boundary, not assumed). Output:
   over-exposed items to seal, guidance corrections, and any invariant that is stated-but-unenforced or
   enforced-but-undocumented.

4. **Test-coverage & wiring auditor.** Tell it to first read the `ironclaw-reborn-testing` skill and
   `.claude/rules/testing.md` (test tiers; test-through-the-caller), then map what the crate's tests
   actually cover vs. what they should: identify **untested public functions, error paths, and edge
   cases**, and — critically — whether the crate is only **unit-tested in isolation** when it has a real
   **integration / e2e path** (through a `*_handler`, `factory::create_*`, or the runtime lane) that is
   never exercised through the full wiring. Output: the specific **unit and integration tests that are
   missing** to guarantee the component always works correctly, each with the behavior it would pin down
   and the tier it belongs in.

Consider **additional angles** when the crate warrants it (spawn them too): a dependency/feature-flag
hygiene pass, a concurrency/`unsafe`/panic-safety pass, or a perf-smell pass. Right-size the fan-out to
the crate — a 200-line crate needs fewer angles than a 3k-line runtime crate.

While the agents run, kick off `cargo build -p <crate> --all-targets` **in the background** to confirm
a green baseline — don't block on it.

**Treat every agent finding as a LEAD, not a fact.** The sub-agents read excerpts, not the whole
workspace, so they routinely disagree with each other and get **external-usage claims wrong** — they
will call a `pub` item "dead" or "test-only" when it has production callers in another crate, and
vice-versa. Any finding that asserts "X has no callers / only test callers / is over-exposed / is
unused" is a hypothesis you MUST verify in §5 before acting on it.

## 5. Synthesize the findings — then VERIFY before acting
Collect every sub-agent's findings into **one deduplicated, prioritized list** (use the thermo-nuclear
ordering: structural regressions → missed simplifications → spaghetti → boundary/type → file size →
modularity → legibility, then fold in the architect's correctness/security/coverage gaps and the
interface/contract/invariant items). Merge overlapping findings; drop low-value nits if bigger
structural issues exist. For each kept finding, decide the **remedy** and whether it fits in this PR's
scope (§2) or should be recorded for a later iteration.

**Before you act on any finding that deletes or seals a public item, grep the workspace yourself to
confirm the caller set** — the agents' external-usage claims (§4) are unreliable and frequently
conflict. For each `pub`/`pub(crate)` item, variant, or function you plan to **delete** or **tighten**:
```
grep -rn "<ItemName>" crates/ src/ --include=*.rs | grep -v "crates/<this-crate>/"
```
Distinguish **construction** from **field/value reads**, and **production** call sites from **test**
ones — a `pub` field with a production reader in another crate is a different decision than one read
only by a test. Only the grep result — not an agent's say-so — decides whether something is dead,
over-exposed, or safe to seal. (Include `src/` in the grep: a Reborn crate may still have a v1 consumer
during the migration.) **Watch for name collisions** — if the symbol shares a name with an unrelated
type elsewhere (e.g. a v1 `db::UserRecord` vs. a Reborn crate's `UserRecord`), the grep floods with
false hits; disambiguate by the import path / `use` line, not the bare name, before calling it dead.
Where grep genuinely can't settle it — e.g. a blanket `impl Trait for Arc<T>` that method resolution
may or may not select — **don't guess: let the §7 workspace build decide** (delete it on the branch;
if the workspace still compiles, it was dead).

**If verification was confusing, that confusion IS a finding — fix the code, don't just route around
it.** When grep floods on a name collision, when you can't tell which of two same-named types a call
site means, when tracing a value across layers required re-reading three files, or when an item's
purpose was unclear until you found (or failed to find) its caller — the defect is in the code's
**naming or comments**, and it is in-scope for this de-slop. Rename the colliding/ambiguous item so the
name is load-bearing for grep and agents (unique names are an invariant — `.claude/rules/types.md`),
or add the one-line comment that would have saved the trace. Record it as a finding alongside the ones
the sub-agents raised; the friction you just hit is the next reader's friction too.

## 6. Apply the fixes
Implement every in-scope finding, applying the skill's **preferred remedies** (delete a layer, collapse
duplicate branches into one flow, extract a helper/module, replace a condition chain with a typed
dispatcher, move logic to its canonical home, **tighten over-exposed `pub`**, **fix/author the crate
guidance**, **rename the ambiguous/colliding item or add the clarifying comment** that the §5 verification
proved was missing, **add the missing unit/integration tests**). Match the crate's surrounding style,
comment density, and idiom.

If a finding is a **deliberate, justified tradeoff** (duplication genuinely clearer than the
abstraction, an invariant deliberately checked elsewhere), don't force it — record the justification in
the PR body. The bar is "every finding *resolved*" — fixed, or explicitly justified.

**Let blast radius (from the §5 grep) decide scope, and keep the PR single-crate by default.** A
seal/delete whose fallout is confined to this crate (+ its own tests) is in-scope — just do it. But when
tightening a `pub` item would force edits to **other crates'** production code (routing their reads
through a new accessor), or would require a new dependency edge / re-export (which
`cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests` guards), that's a cross-crate change masquerading as de-slop:
**defer it** rather than drag this PR into three crates. Likewise defer anything that **changes the
crate's observable contract or adds a dependency**. Fix the clean, contained findings now; hand off the
ripple-y ones per "Deferred findings" below.

### Deferred findings — file them as GitHub issues, don't just mention them
A **correctness, security, race, data-integrity, or architecture** finding that you cannot safely fix
inside this single-crate de-slop PR (because it changes observable behavior, needs a new dependency, or
ripples across crates) does not get buried in a PR-body paragraph — **file it as a GitHub issue** so it
is tracked independently of whether this PR merges:
```
gh issue create --title "<crate>: <one-line defect>" \
  --body "<what/where (file:line) · why it's real · the failing scenario · the fix or the test that would close it · why it was out of scope for the de-slop PR>"
```
Label it if the repo uses labels (`gh label list`). File **one issue per distinct defect** (don't batch
unrelated findings). Then reference the issue number in both the PR body (§8) and the ledger (§9). The
premise-wrong verdict (§2) is filed the same way. Pure-quality deferrals (a bigger refactor that's just
structural, no correctness stake) may instead be recorded as a "remaining slice" in the ledger without an
issue — issues are for **substantive** findings a human needs to see, not for de-slop backlog.

### Anti-reward-hacking guard — inspect YOUR OWN diff
Reject and redo your own change if it:
- adds a net-new `#[ignore]`, `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()`, `.unwrap()`/`.expect()` in production code,
  or `#[allow(...)]` **just to pass a gate or quiet a finding**;
- introduces `super::` imports in non-test code, or inlines a multi-line prompt template as a Rust
  constant instead of a `prompts/*.md` + `include_str!()`;
- **weakens** any existing test assertion or deletes/truncates retained LLM data;
- "addresses" a coverage finding with a test that asserts nothing (no meaningful `assert!`), or fixes
  guidance by documenting the bug instead of fixing it;
- pushes a file from **<1k to >1k lines** without strong justification;
- adds a log line that violates the privacy/logging doctrine (§2).

The job is to make the crate **cleaner, better-documented, and better-tested** — not to silence the
detectors. A new test must actually pin behavior; a sealed `pub` must still compile the workspace.

## 7. Gates — ALL must pass locally (or be CI-deferred with a stated reason)
```
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy -p <crate> --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test  -p <crate>
cargo test  -p ironclaw_architecture_tests          # dependency-boundary enforcement for crates/
cargo build --workspace --all-targets         # sealing a pub can break OTHER crates — this catches it
cargo clippy --all --benches --tests --examples --all-features
```
Sealing a public item can break **other** crates — the workspace build/clippy catches that; fix the
fallout or keep the item public with a note. If the crate has an **integration** feature, run
`cargo test -p <crate> --features integration` when Docker is reachable (the workspace-root
`integration` feature is empty — the flag only means something per-crate); if it has a **Reborn e2e** path
(turns, runtime lanes, host services, authorization, approvals, networking, secrets, product
workflow, capability dispatch), run `scripts/reborn-e2e-rust.sh`. Any tier you cannot run here (needs
Postgres/Docker/keys) → note it **"CI-deferred"** in the PR body. Everything runnable must be **green
after your fixes**.

## 8. Self thermo-nuclear pass + land — stop at PR
1. **Re-run the thermo-nuclear standards on your OWN diff** (read the SKILL, apply directly). It must
   clear the **Approval Bar**: no structural regression, no missed obvious simplification, no
   unjustified file-size explosion, no spaghetti branching, no hacky/magical abstraction, no needless
   wrapper/cast/optionality, no boundary leak or canonical-helper duplication. If a new finding appears,
   loop back to §6.
2. **Commit:** `refactor(<crate>): de-slop — <one-line summary>` (use `refactor` for structural
   changes, `test` if the PR is mostly added coverage, `docs` if mostly guidance, `fix` if you
   corrected a real bug a finding exposed). End the message with:
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
   (The commit-msg hook requires a regression test with every `fix` — write it test-first, §Testing
   Discipline in CLAUDE.md.)
3. **Push and open the PR** with `gh pr create --base main`. PR body states: the **crate**, the
   **findings grouped by angle** (quality / architecture & security / interface & contract & invariants
   / coverage), **what you changed** for each, any **deliberate tradeoff** left in place with its
   justification, which **gates ran locally** and what is **CI-deferred** (integration/e2e needing
   Postgres/Docker/keys), and the **out-of-scope findings you filed as issues** (§6) linked by number
   (`#NNNN`). End with:
   `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
4. **STOP. Do not merge.**

## 9. Record
Append one line to `.work/deslop-ledger.md`: crate · branch · PR# · gate status · what was fixed ·
**issues filed** (`#NNNN` from §6). Add the crate to the **DESLOPPED** list so the next iteration skips
it. If you only de-slopped a **slice** of a large crate (§2), record the **remaining slices** so the
next iteration continues it rather than marking the whole crate done. If the review concluded the crate's
*premise* is wrong (§2) and you pushed no fixes, record that verdict and the issue number instead so a
human can decide.

Then end the turn; the loop paces the next iteration.
