# Skills System

SKILL.md files extend the agent's prompt with domain-specific instructions. Each skill is a YAML frontmatter block (metadata, activation criteria, required tools) followed by a markdown body injected into the LLM context.

## Trust Model

| Trust Level | Source | Tool Access |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **Trusted** | User-placed in `~/.ironclaw/skills/` or workspace `skills/` | All tools available to the agent |
| **Installed** | Downloaded from ClawHub registry or HTTPS skill URL (`~/.ironclaw/installed_skills/`, or URL provenance metadata in Reborn scoped skill storage) | Read-only tools only (no shell, file write, HTTP) |

## SKILL.md Format

# Skill instructions here...
```

Only the top-level `requires:` block is supported. The historical nested shape
`metadata.openclaw.requires` is unsupported and ignored by the current parser,
so older external skills must be migrated instead of relying on silent
compatibility.

The parser supports more than the example above shows (source of truth:
`crates/domains/ironclaw_skills/src/types.rs` and `selector.rs`):

- `requires.bins`, `requires.env`, and **`requires.config`** are gating inputs.
- **`requires.skills`** declares companion skills that should chain-load when
  available; missing companions do not prevent the parent skill from loading.
- `activation.setup_marker` gates a skill on a workspace setup-marker file
  (used by the `*-setup` skill family).
- **Silent truncation caps**: `enforce_limits` keeps at most
  `MAX_KEYWORDS_PER_SKILL = 20` keywords and `MAX_PATTERNS_PER_SKILL = 5`
  patterns per skill — anything beyond is dropped without error. Keep lists
  within those caps or your extra triggers simply don't exist.

When parser behavior changes, update this file in the same PR
(`ironclaw-reborn-skill-maintainer` rule 7).

## Selection Pipeline

1. **Gating** -- Check binary/env/config requirements; skip skills whose prerequisites are missing
2. **Scoring** -- Deterministic scoring: keywords (10/5 pts, cap 30) + patterns (20 pts, cap 40) + tags (3 pts, cap 15). `exclude_keywords` veto (score = 0 if any present). Pattern (regex) scoring is gated on the config-file setting `[skills] regex_activation_enabled` (default `true`; `SkillsSection` in `crates/app/ironclaw_config/src/config_file.rs` — there is no env var for it); when `false`, regex activation contributes 0 and only keywords/tags/explicit mentions can select a skill.
3. **Budget** -- Select top-scoring skills within the prompt token budget (`DEFAULT_MAX_SKILL_CONTEXT_TOKENS = 4000` in `crates/loop/ironclaw_loop_host/src/skill_activation/activation.rs`, overridable via `set_max_context_tokens`; the former `SKILLS_MAX_TOKENS` env var is not read by anything)
4. **Attenuation** -- Minimum trust across active skills determines tool ceiling; installed skills lose dangerous tools

## Skill Tools

- `skill_list` -- List all discovered skills with trust level and status
- `skill_search` -- Search ClawHub registry for available skills
- `skill_install` -- Install a skill from raw SKILL.md content or ClawHub
- `skill_install_url` -- Fetch and install a skill from an HTTPS raw SKILL.md, ZIP bundle, or supported GitHub repository/tree URL
- `skill_remove` -- Remove an installed skill
