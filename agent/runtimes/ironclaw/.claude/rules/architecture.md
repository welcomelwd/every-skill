# Architecture Discipline — Stop the Sprawl Before It Ships

This rule exists because architecture reviews found a class
of slow-burn architectural decay that no existing rule catches. The
individual symptoms look reasonable in isolation (one extra Arc, one
extra method arg, one `with_*` builder, one `#[allow(...)]`). The
class is recognizable only when you grep for the smoke alarms across
the crate: repeated `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` annotations,
oversized runtime modules, parallel dispatch pipelines, and the same service
handles threaded through several layers without being given a name.

The rule is: **listen to the language. When the compiler or clippy
complains, the answer is almost never `#[allow]`.**

## Five smells, with grep-able patterns

### 1. Argument creep — `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` is a smoke alarm

clippy's default is 7 args. Reaching it means the function has more
inputs than a reader can hold in their head. Allowing it once is a
trade — allowing it 38 times across 26 files (measured on this tree with
`rg -c '#\[allow\(clippy::too_many_arguments\)\]' crates/`) is a refactor
someone declined to do.

**Required pattern** when introducing the allow:

```rust
// arch-exempt: too_many_args, <one-line reason>, plan #NNNN
#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
fn execute_orchestrator(...)
```

The annotation must name *what aggregation is missing* (a context
struct, a service bundle, a config object) and link a tracking
issue or plan. "Refactor needed" is not a reason; "needs `EngineServices`
bundle, plan #2800" is.

**Review flag:** any added `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`
without an `arch-exempt` annotation on the line above it.

### 2. Optional Arcs that are required in production

```rust
struct Foo {
    a: Arc<dyn Bar>,
    b: Option<Arc<dyn Baz>>,  // <- smell
}

impl Foo {
    fn with_baz(mut self, b: Arc<dyn Baz>) -> Self { ... }
}
```

If production wires `with_baz` every time and only test code skips
it, the type system is lying. The `is_some()` branches that result
become dead paths in production and the favourite home of bugs that
only one user trips.

**Rule:** `Option<Arc<…>>` on a runtime struct is allowed only when
the dependency is *genuinely* optional (e.g., a feature-flagged
component that the binary may legitimately ship without). If the
production wiring always sets it, either:

- Make it required and have tests construct it with a fake.
- Or move the conditional behavior into a separate type (split the
  struct).

**Review flag:** `Option<Arc<` added on a struct field, paired with a
`with_<name>` builder that the production call site always invokes.

### 3. Re-derived identity / duplicated state

A field that already lives on a primary entity (`Thread.id`,
`Thread.user_id`, `Thread.project_id`) cannot be re-declared on a
context struct that the same code path constructs from that entity.

```rust
// Bad: ThreadExecutionContext re-declares thread_id, project_id, user_id
//      that already exist on Thread, and the constructor copies them.
struct ThreadExecutionContext {
    thread_id: ThreadId,
    project_id: ProjectId,
    user_id: String,
    // ... step-scoped fields
}

// Good: pass the source-of-truth entity by reference; only carry
//       step-scoped data on the side struct.
struct StepFrame<'t> {
    thread: &'t Thread,
    step_id: StepId,
    current_call_id: Option<String>,
}
```

**Why:** identity confusion has shipped four times in `types.md`
(PRs #2561, #2473, #2512, #2574). Duplicating identity onto a side
struct *adds another copy* of the value the compiler cannot enforce
agreement on.

**Review flag:** a field on type `B` whose name and type match a
field on type `A` when `B` is constructed from `A` in the same file.

### 4. Duplicate dispatch pipelines

When the same downstream call (`effects.execute_action`,
`safety_layer.scan_*`, `dispatcher.dispatch`) is invoked from two
places that each implement their own pre-checks (lease, policy,
sanitization), they are one pipeline written twice. Every
safety/policy change must then land in both — and one always lags.

This mirrors the boundary in `safety-and-sandbox.md` ("Mediation is the
boundary"). The pattern: identify the converging downstream call,
extract a single gateway, route both sides through it.

**Review flag:** a new call site to a registry/executor/dispatcher
trait method that re-implements pre-checks (lookup, policy, lease,
scan) already implemented at another call site.

### 5. File size budget

A `.rs` file > 1,500 lines is a refactor the codebase has been
postponing. A file > 3,000 lines is a refactor that is already
costing review time. There is no hard cap, but:

- New files: aim for < 800 lines.
- Existing files between 1,500 and 3,000: every PR that touches them
  should leave them shorter, not longer, unless the PR is explicitly
  expanding a feature that has nowhere else to live.
- Existing files > 3,000: file a tracking issue for decomposition.
  PRs that *add* > 200 lines need an inline justification.

This is not a mechanical check — it's a culture norm. The
mechanical check is "does this file have a tracking issue."

## Where each rule is enforced

The rules above are deliberately split across enforcement layers
because each layer catches a different failure mode.

| Smell | Pre-commit script | CI / clippy | Code review | Agent-facing (this file) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. `too_many_arguments` allow | yes — `ARCH-SPRAWL` annotation grep | clippy default already fires | required | yes |
| 2. `Option<Arc<…>>` + `with_*` | yes — `ARCH-SPRAWL` paired-pattern grep | — | required | yes |
| 3. Re-derived identity | — (heuristic) | — | required | yes |
| 4. Duplicate dispatch | partial — `ARCH-SPRAWL` repeated known-method grep | — | required | yes |
| 5. File size | yes — `ARCH-SPRAWL` `wc -l` on changed files | — | informational | yes |

### Why this split

- **Pre-commit catches the mechanical patterns.** `scripts/pre-commit-safety.sh`
  runs an `ARCH-SPRAWL` check for #1 (annotation grep), #2 (paired field/builder
  patterns), #4 (repeated known downstream-call smoke alarms), and #5 (line
  count). These are cheap, deterministic, and run on every commit. #3 stays
  review-only because identity re-derivation requires semantic code reading.
- **CI / clippy catches what compilers can express.** clippy already
  emits `too_many_arguments`. The rule is "don't silence it without
  a plan link." No new CI check needed; existing default works once
  the annotation discipline lands.
- **Code review catches semantic patterns.** #3 and #4 require
  reading the code, not the diff. The annotation `// arch-exempt:
  <category>, <reason>, plan #NNNN` puts the burden on the proposer
  to name the aggregation that is missing — reviewers reject
  exempts without a plan link.
- **This rule file is the agent-facing summary.** Loaded into context
  whenever an agent edits `crates/**/*.rs`. The
  agent's job: *don't be the one who adds the twelfth `#[allow]`.*

## Annotation format (consistent with other rules)

```rust
// arch-exempt: <category>, <reason>, plan #NNNN
```

Categories:

- `too_many_args` — function signature grew past clippy default.
- `optional_arc` — `Option<Arc<…>>` field on a runtime struct.
- `parallel_dispatch` — second call site to a converging downstream.
- `large_file` — file size growing past 1,500 lines.

Each must name a tracking issue or plan that owns the cleanup. An
exempt without a plan link is a violation, not an exception.

## What this rule does NOT cover

- **Trait shape.** Trait method signatures are part of the public
  contract; their argument count is governed by API design, not
  this rule.
- **Test code.** Tests are allowed to construct things with the
  full Arc bag explicitly when that makes the test clearer.
  `#[cfg(test)]` blocks are skipped by the pre-commit check.
- **Generated code.** WIT bindings, `serde` derive output, and
  similar machine-emitted code are exempt (they are not what a
  reader maintains).
- **One-off scripts under `scripts/`.** Architectural sprawl in a
  shell script or migration helper is a different conversation.

## Direction: the consolidation plan for this debt

The smells above are symptoms of duplicated ownership, optional production
dependencies, and parallel execution paths. When an exemption is necessary,
name the missing owner or aggregation in the `arch-exempt` comment and link the
current issue or contract that governs the follow-up. Do not cite deleted plan
documents as architectural authority.

- Adjacent rules with the same shape (extract a single gateway,
  route everything through it): `safety-and-sandbox.md`,
  `gateway-events.md`.
- Type location/multiplicity (mirror DTOs, `host_api` ownership):
  `type-placement.md` — the rule the capability-path collapse applies.
- Annotation discipline: the canonical shape is this rule's own
  `// arch-exempt: <category>, <detail>, plan #NNNN`, enforced by the
  `ARCH-SPRAWL` checks in `scripts/pre-commit-safety.sh`. (`gateway-events.md`
  carries no `projection-exempt` convention; that cross-reference was wrong.)
