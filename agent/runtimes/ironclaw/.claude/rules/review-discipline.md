# Review and fix discipline

## Review the whole contract

Inspect implementation, callers, persistence, wire types, frontend consumers,
tests, and relevant Reborn contracts. Search for the bug pattern across
`crates/`, not only the reported instance. Verify negative claims with both
symbol and concept searches.

Every bug fix needs a regression test that would fail before the fix. Add a
`#[test]`, `#[tokio::test]`, contract test, or integration scenario that
reproduces the original failure. Prefer a caller-level or integration test when
wrappers, computed inputs, or side effects separate the helper from the
behavior. Documentation-only changes are exempt. If a regression test is
genuinely infeasible, document why in the PR and use the repository's explicit
regression-check exemption rather than silently omitting coverage.

## Mechanical review traps

- **Zero warnings:** changed Reborn crates must pass clippy with
  `--all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`. Before committing, run the
  Reborn workspace-wide command below and fix every warning it surfaces,
  including pre-existing warnings outside the immediate files.
- **Feature matrix, not just `--all-features`:** `--all-features` cannot catch
  feature-gated dead code — a `#[cfg(feature = "x")]`-only caller makes its
  helper *live* under `--all-features` and *dead* (a `-D warnings` error)
  everywhere the feature is off. **PR CI runs only the slim `all-features` lane;
  the broader `default` lane runs post-merge**, so this class can break `main`
  after a green PR. If you add or move a `#[cfg(feature = ...)]` gate, or touch
  a helper only reachable through one, run the relevant feature lanes locally
  before merging (see "Required checks"). When you gate the only caller(s) of a
  helper behind a feature, gate the helper's definition with the same `#[cfg]`.
- **UTF-8:** never byte-slice user or external strings with `&value[..n]`.
  Use `char_indices()`, `chars()`, or an `is_char_boundary()`-checked boundary.
  Search changed Rust files for suspicious `[..` slicing.
- **Case-insensitive external values:** normalize case-insensitive identifiers,
  media types, extensions, and platform-sensitive path comparisons at the
  boundary with `to_ascii_lowercase()` or `eq_ignore_ascii_case()`. Do not
  lowercase case-sensitive opaque values.
- **Decorator delegation:** when a trait method is added, enumerate every
  production implementation, decorator, adapter, and test double. For
  `LlmProvider`, start with `rg -n "impl LlmProvider for" crates` and test
  through the full wrapper chain.
- **Production panics:** search changed production files for `.unwrap()` and
  `.expect()`; they are prohibited outside tests. Propagate an explicit error
  instead.
- **Imports:** prefer `crate::` for cross-module imports. `super::` is acceptable
  inside tightly coupled submodules and tests.
- **Pattern fixes:** search all of `crates/` for sibling instances of the bug.

## Required checks

Run the narrowest crate tests and clippy first. Add:

```bash
cargo test -p ironclaw_architecture_tests
cargo clippy -p OWNING_CRATE --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
scripts/pre-commit-safety.sh
```

Workspace-wide zero-warning clippy:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Feature matrix — reproduces the post-merge `Code Style` gate that PR CI skips
(it only runs the `all-features` lane). Run both whenever a change adds, moves,
or relies on a `#[cfg(feature = ...)]` gate:

```bash
cargo clippy --all --tests --examples -- -D warnings                              # default
cargo clippy --all --tests --examples --all-features -- -D warnings               # all-features
```

Run the Reborn integration or E2E harness when the change crosses turns,
capabilities, authorization, approvals, persistence, runtime lanes, networking,
secrets, product orchestration, or user-visible transport.

## Scope discipline

The PR title and body must describe the full diff. If a change crosses several
layers, name that scope or split the PR. Move-only changes state that behavior
is unchanged, keep behavioral fixes separate, and record follow-up issues for
problems discovered during the move. After moving or renaming code, search
`.claude/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `crates/AGENTS.md`,
`docs/internal/reborn/contracts/`, and other Markdown references for stale paths.

## Removing a "redundant" layer un-masks behavior

A layer you delete as redundant is often silently *backstopping* behavior the
downstream code does not reproduce. Deleting it does not remove the behavior —
it exposes the gap, as a test failure if you are lucky and a silent regression
if you are not. This is the dominant hazard of consolidation/dedup refactors.
Motivating case: PRs #6386/#6392 (the `authorize()` policy consolidation) —
removing `ironclaw_host_runtime`'s "redundant" pre-authorization surfaced five
behaviors it had been masking (a stale import, model-message sanitization,
run-record ordering for unknown capabilities, dropped runtime-policy enforcement
on the resume paths, and a mismatch-vs-unknown precedence flip).

Discipline when deleting a layer you believe is redundant:

- **Run the full, unfiltered suite for every touched crate** — `cargo test -p
  <crate> --no-fail-fast` — and do **not** pipe test output through `head`/`tail`.
  A partial view under-counts failures (this hid three real failures twice
  during #6392). Filtered green is not green.
- **Every surfaced failure is a candidate real behavior, not a test to edit.**
  For each, determine whether the deleted layer was providing it and whether the
  surviving code reproduces it. **Preserve the behavior; do not weaken the
  assertion to go green** unless you have proven the old behavior was itself
  wrong (and say why in the PR). Silently updating a test to match the new output
  is how a consolidation ships a regression.
- **The load-bearing observable is the failure *kind* and durable state**
  (`RuntimeFailureKind`, run-state transitions, audit `error_kind`) — not the
  message text. Preserve the kind exactly; the sanitized model-visible message is
  a separate, weaker contract (`error-handling.md`).
- **"Redundant" is per-path.** A check redundant on one entry path (e.g.
  invoke/spawn) can be the *only* copy on another (e.g. resume/auth-resume).
  Confirm the survivor covers **every** path before deleting, not just the one
  you inspected.

When the work is sliced across subagents, give each the standing instruction to
**stop and report a surfaced behavior rather than commit green or weaken a
test** — the reviewer, not the slice author, decides whether a delta is
acceptable.

## Guardrails are code

Checks and hooks need regression tests, must handle multiline syntax, and must
run when their own files change. Never claim enforcement without executing the
enforcing command. Comments and docs that promise guarantees must match the
code and tests.
