# Exemplar Tests — What Good Looks Like at Each Tier

Living companions to the tier tree in `../SKILL.md`. Each exemplar is a real in-tree test to open and imitate; re-verify paths with the given command before citing them onward.

## 1. Side-effect proof at the caller

`tests/integration/group_approvals/scenario_gate_then_approve.rs` — drives a scripted `builtin.write_file` through the **real** stack: first-party runtime → `PermissionMode::Ask` → `TurnStatus::BlockedApproval` → real `ApprovalResolver::approve_dispatch` (lease issued) → `coordinator.resume_turn` → `Completed` — and then **asserts the file exists on disk**. The assertion target is the side effect itself, not a mock's call count. When your change gates a side effect, this is the shape: drive the public entry point, assert the world changed. Re-verify: `ls tests/integration/group_approvals/`.

## 2. The scripted-model harness seam

The in-process harness (code in `tests/integration/support/`, spec in `tests/integration/CLAUDE.md`) fakes exactly one thing: the vendor SDK at the bottom (`TraceLlm`). Everything else — product orchestration, coordinator, scheduler, agent loop, the real `ironclaw_llm` retry/failover/circuit-breaker chain — executes for real, and assertions read *persisted state* (filesystem, thread history), never internals.

- **Right**: mock at the vendor-SDK seam; assert from durable state; `cargo test --test reborn_integration_<name>` runs offline with zero setup.
- **Wrong**: mocking at the gateway seam (skips the whole `ironclaw_llm` chain — that's the separate binary-replay tier's job); hand-building `TraceStep`s; asserting on internal structs.

## 3. The declare/enforce contract pair

Two tests lock the WebChat v2 surface from opposite sides — copy the pairing whenever policy is declared in one crate and enforced in another:

- `crates/product/ironclaw_webui/tests/webui_v2_descriptors_contract.rs` — locks the **declared** policy table per route (method, auth schemes, body/rate limits, CORS, audit class). Adding a route without updating it fails CI.
- `crates/product/ironclaw_webui/tests/webui_v2_handlers_contract.rs` — drives a **real axum router** against a stub facade, including the fail-closed case (`missing_caller_extension_returns_500`). Its header cites the test-through-the-caller rule; that's the level of intent-documentation to imitate.

The *enforcement* side (real HTTP 401/413/429/CORS through the composed app) lives in `crates/app/ironclaw_composition/tests/webui_v2_serve.rs` — caller-level, not middleware unit tests.

## 4. Helper-only coverage: the cautionary shape

When a predicate selects what goes out the wire, the test must construct the real adapter and inspect the rendered egress body, not call the predicate directly. Use the owning product adapter's caller-level delivery contract and its Telegram egress case as the shape to copy. If you're adding a channel, write the caller-level adapter test on day one.

## 5. Silent skip vs loud skip

**BAD for PR-gated coverage**: `if docker_unavailable { return }` — the container security suite silently vanishes from CI and no gate notices. Existing Docker sandbox canaries still use soft skips; don't copy that pattern into new gate coverage.

**GOOD**: make absence loud — feature-gate the test (`#![cfg(all(feature = "postgres", feature = "integration"))]`), or require an explicit opt-out env var and *fail* when the dependency is missing without it. A skipped security test that doesn't announce itself is indistinguishable from coverage.

## 6. Naming your contract's tests

`docs/internal/reborn/contracts/conversation-binding.md` is the model contract doc: it names its proving test file (`crates/domains/ironclaw_conversations/tests/inbound_contract.rs`) *and* the run command. `scripts/reborn-e2e-rust.sh` is the machine-readable contract→test map. If you implement contract behavior: extend the named test, and add the doc's "which tests prove this" line if it's missing.
