# PR-derived browser test recipes

Choose the smallest set that reaches the changed contract.

| PR change | Primary browser evidence | Important second case |
|---|---|---|
| New page or component | Navigate through the intended entrypoint and verify rendered content/actions | Deep-link and refresh |
| Form or settings | Submit realistic valid input and verify the resulting state | Invalid/boundary input; refresh read-back |
| CRUD | Create clearly named temporary data and verify it appears | Edit/read-back; delete only when safe |
| Navigation/routing | Click through and verify URL plus target content | Browser back/forward or direct URL |
| Auth/session | Login and verify protected content | Refresh, logout, or denied route as relevant |
| Permissions | Verify the allowed role can act | Verify a lower role is denied without side effects |
| Backend behavior exposed in UI | Trigger through the nearest production caller and verify rendered result | Error/retry path |
| Upload/download | Upload a small non-sensitive fixture and verify it is usable | Download/read-back and content identity |
| Async job/automation | Start the action and verify status transition | Refresh/poll to terminal state |
| Streaming/live updates | Measure visible DOM/state changes over time | Existing-page follow-up or reconnect case |
| Visual/layout | Inspect the changed viewport and interaction | One adjacent supported breakpoint |
| Error handling | Trigger bounded safe failure and verify actionable UI | Recovery/retry succeeds |

## Evidence standard

A click, HTTP 200, toast, or raw event is not enough when the PR promises a
user-visible or durable outcome. Prefer:

- rendered state after the action;
- read-back after refresh/navigation;
- exact URL and route state;
- role-specific allowed/denied behavior;
- terminal job status;
- downloaded or persisted content identity;
- visible incremental changes for streaming.

Before crediting a result, verify the journey exercised the intended contract,
not merely a nearby successful behavior. Record the actual provider/model,
route, role, tool or operation, and relevant starting state when any of those
are part of the acceptance claim. A fallback provider, similarly named tool,
different route, broader role, or already-existing state is supplemental
evidence only. If it replaced a required journey, that journey was not
executed and the overall Railway QA status is BLOCKED.

Local tests and fixtures may prove deterministic protocol details, but they do
not turn an unavailable required live canary into a browser PASS.

## Test-data discipline

- Use names prefixed with `railway-test-` when creating temporary records.
- Do not use secrets, PII, or user-owned content.
- Resolve exact targets before deletion.
- Clean up only records created by the current test.
- State explicitly when cleanup was not authorized or could not be verified.
