# Railway Test

Test the behavior the PR claims to change against the exact deployed PR head.
Derive the browser plan from the PR instead of running a fixed chat scenario.

## Inputs and secrets

Resolve from the request or current repository:

- PR number or URL. If omitted, use `gh pr view`.
- Repository. Default to `nearai/ironclaw`; the preview URL fallback is
  repo-specific, so an explicit repository must be supplied when testing
  another repo.
- Preview URL. Resolve it from the request or Railway status. For
  `nearai/ironclaw`, fall back to
  `https://ironclaw-ironclaw-pr-<PR>.up.railway.app`.
- Preview bearer token. Reuse an authenticated browser session when possible;
  otherwise request it from the user.

Never persist the bearer in the skill, repository, scripts, shell history,
URLs, PR text, logs, screenshots, or final response. Never print or repeat it.
Type it only into the preview login UI. Do not inspect or return browser
storage values containing it.

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the PR before opening Railway

Read repository guidance relevant to testing. For Ironclaw, read
`docs/internal/testing-playbook.md` before selecting tests.

Inspect:

```bash
gh pr view <PR> --repo <REPO> \
  --json number,title,body,url,baseRefName,headRefName,headRefOid,files
gh pr diff <PR> --repo <REPO>
```

Identify:

- the user-visible behavior promised by the PR;
- affected routes, screens, roles, and state;
- the exact regression or before/after claim;
- important success, validation, permission, and error paths;
- dependencies on external services, model behavior, or persisted data.

Write a compact Given/When/Then test matrix before interacting with the
preview. Give every row an `Acceptance` classification:

- **Required**: directly proves an explicit user request, PR acceptance
  criterion, or the exact regression claim.
- **Supplemental**: deployment health, adjacent behavior, or a useful proxy
  that does not itself prove the changed contract.

Use [references/test-recipes.md](references/test-recipes.md) to choose only
relevant cases. Do not default to chat or streaming tests. Never reclassify a
required case as supplemental because the preview lacks its provider, model,
credentials, role, feature flag, or test data; that makes the run BLOCKED.

#### Mandatory status gate

Compute the overall heading from required cases only:

1. **FAIL** if any required case was executed against the intended contract
   and the observed behavior contradicted the acceptance claim.
2. Otherwise **BLOCKED** if any required case was not executed, was
   inconclusive, or used a substitute provider, model, route, role, tool,
   state transition, or pre-existing object instead of the intended one.
3. **PASS** only if every required case was executed against the intended
   contract and passed.

Passing supplemental cases, a healthy deployment, local tests, recorded
fixtures, or a nearest-caller check can add evidence but can never upgrade
FAIL or BLOCKED to PASS. If no required case can run, stop after collecting
bounded diagnostics and publish BLOCKED; do not invent a proxy journey merely
to produce a browser PASS.

### 2. Confirm the intended build is live

Run (resolve the path against this skill's `scripts/` directory):

```bash
scripts/preview_state.sh <PR> [REPO] [PREVIEW_URL]
```

Record `head_sha`, `railway_state` (`success`, `pending`, `failure`, `error`,
`missing`, or `query_failed`), `railway_details`, and `asset`. The script
queries the commit-scoped status and check-run endpoints, so the result is
bound to the tested head SHA — never a stale build. Poll every 30–45 seconds,
up to 20 attempts (roughly 15 minutes), until `railway_state` reports
`success`. Send a concise progress update at least once per minute.

If the exact-head Railway status is still `pending`, `missing`, or
`query_failed` after the attempt limit, stop polling and report BLOCKED with
the latest diagnostics; never test a partial build. A `failure` or `error`
status is BLOCKED as well until the intended build is live.

For frontend changes, compare the asset hash with the pre-deploy baseline.
For backend-only changes, an unchanged asset is acceptable after the
head-specific Railway check passes. Do not test a stale build.

If Railway fails, inspect the linked check/deployment and stop browser testing
until the intended build is live.

The PR head can move while this skill runs. Re-read `headRefOid` immediately
before opening the preview (step 3) and again immediately before publishing
(step 7). If either read differs from `head_sha`, restart build confirmation
for the new head, or report BLOCKED for the stale build; never run or publish
browser evidence against a head you did not confirm.

### 3. Open and authenticate the preview

Re-read `headRefOid` and confirm it still equals the `head_sha` recorded in
step 2 before opening the preview; if it changed, return to step 2 for the new
head instead of testing a stale build.

Select the browser driver available in the current agent harness:

- If `browser:control-in-app-browser` is available, read and follow it and use
  the in-app browser.
- Otherwise use the harness's supported browser automation capability (for
  example a browser tool, Playwright integration, or Chrome integration) that
  can inspect rendered DOM and interact through visible controls.
- If no browser automation capability is available, mark every required
  browser case BLOCKED. HTTP requests, local tests, or source inspection may be
  supplemental evidence, but they do not constitute browser acceptance.

Announce which driver is opening the preview and that the supplied token will
be used only for UI login. Open the route most relevant to the PR; use `/chat`
only for chat changes. Wait for session initialization and inspect rendered DOM
before assuming labels or controls.

- If already authenticated, continue.
- If a login form appears, fill the bearer into its token/password field and
  submit without exposing it in tool titles or output.
- If authentication fails, report only that the credential was rejected.

### 4. Execute the PR-specific browser matrix

For each selected case:

1. Capture the starting URL and a focused DOM snapshot.
2. Perform the smallest realistic user journey through visible controls.
3. Verify that the actual provider, model, route, role, tool, and starting
   state match the required case before crediting the journey.
4. Assert the promised outcome from rendered state, not click success.
5. Refresh, revisit, or read back when persistence matters.
6. Record concise evidence: acceptance classification, intended contract,
   actual contract exercised, route, action, observed result, and status.

Treat identity mismatches as **not executed**, not as successful fallbacks.
For example, if a case requires `tool_search` but the model calls web search,
or requires deferred-tool promotion but invokes a tool that was already
advertised, the required case is BLOCKED even when the substitute call works.

Prefer caller-facing verification:

- For saved settings or CRUD, read back after refresh or navigation.
- For permissions, test both the intended role and a safe denied path when
  credentials are available.
- For navigation, test deep links and refresh behavior.
- For errors, use bounded invalid input; do not damage shared data.
- For backend-only changes, drive the nearest real UI caller when one exists.
- For side effects, create clearly named temporary test data and clean it up
  only when cleanup is safe and authorized.

Do not modify code or production state beyond reversible test data unless the
user explicitly requested a fix or broader mutation.

### 5. Run specialized checks only when relevant

- Streaming or incremental UI: read
  [references/streaming-cadence.md](references/streaming-cadence.md) and measure
  visible DOM growth. Raw wire delivery alone is insufficient.
- Upload/download: use a small non-sensitive fixture and verify content
  read-back, not only a success toast.
- Responsive/layout: inspect at the viewport sizes named in the PR or the
  nearest product-supported breakpoints.
- Auth/session: verify login, refresh, logout, and denied access only to the
  extent the PR changes those contracts.
- External provider/model: separate deterministic surface evidence from live
  canary variability. If the PR requires a specific live provider/model and
  the preview cannot run it, record deterministic tests as supplemental and
  mark the required live case BLOCKED.

Skip unrelated recipes and state why.

### 6. Diagnose failures without silently expanding scope

When a case fails:

- reproduce once;
- capture the smallest useful DOM, route, status, and timing evidence;
- distinguish stale deployment, authentication, frontend presentation,
  backend response, persistence, and external-service failures;
- inspect read-only logs or network evidence when available;
- do not implement a fix unless requested.

If the PR claim conflicts with live behavior, report the conflict rather than
weakening the test.

### 7. Build evidence, clean up, and publish PR evidence

Build the full evidence body FIRST, before any cleanup, so a browser or
cleanup failure can never lose the PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED result. Include:

- a `Railway preview QA — PASS|FAIL|BLOCKED` heading;
- the tested head SHA, Railway state, preview URL, and relevant route;
- the Given/When/Then matrix with `Required`/`Supplemental`, intended versus
  actual contract, and concise observed evidence;
- a status derivation listing required cases passed, failed, blocked, or not
  executed; verify the heading follows the mandatory status gate;
- the exact regression result and any refresh or read-back result;
- skipped cases with reasons and remaining risks or blockers;
- cleanup status;
- `<!-- railway-test:evidence head=<HEAD_SHA> -->` as a hidden marker.

Never include the bearer, credentials, sensitive browser state, or secrets.

Then clean up, guarded so failures cannot skip publication:

1. Remove tracked `railway-test-` test data in a `finally`-equivalent step;
   record cleanup status in the evidence regardless of outcome.
2. Finalize browser tabs best effort using the selected driver's close or
   cleanup operation. With the Codex in-app browser, use:

```js
await browser.tabs.finalize({ keep: [] })
```

3. Re-read `headRefOid` once more. If it differs from the tested head,
   discard the browser observations: rebuild the evidence as
   `Railway preview QA — BLOCKED` with the reason (`head changed during
   testing: tested <old SHA>, head is now <new SHA>`) and no stale PASS/FAIL
   heading or matrix, then publish that.
4. Publish the prepared evidence as a comment on the tested pull request.
   Post evidence for PASS, FAIL, and BLOCKED runs; a failed or blocked test is
   still useful PR evidence. Never put the bearer, credentials, sensitive
   browser state, or secrets in the comment.

   List ALL matching comments — paginated, filtered to the current GitHub
   user and the exact head marker:

   ```bash
   GH_USER="$(gh api user --jq .login)"
   gh api --paginate repos/<REPO>/issues/<PR>/comments \
     --jq ".[] | select(.user.login == \"$GH_USER\") | select(.body | contains(\"railway-test:evidence head=<HEAD_SHA>\")) | .id"
   ```

   Reconcile to exactly one canonical comment before publishing:

   - No match: create a new comment:

     ```bash
     gh pr comment <PR> --repo <REPO> --body-file <evidence-file>
     ```

   - Exactly one match: update it (the API needs PATCH, not the default GET):

     ```bash
     gh api --method PATCH repos/<REPO>/issues/comments/<COMMENT_ID> \
       -F body=@<evidence-file>
     ```

   - Multiple matches (a lost create response or a concurrent run): keep the
     first as canonical and delete the duplicates:

     ```bash
     gh api --method DELETE repos/<REPO>/issues/comments/<DUPLICATE_ID>
     ```

     then update the canonical comment as above.

   Re-list with the same query after creating, updating, or deleting; if the
   list still does not contain exactly one comment for this user and head,
   reconcile again before reporting success. A new deployed head gets a new
   evidence comment; the same head is never published twice.
5. Capture the resulting comment URL and include it in the final response.

Do not report the Railway test as fully delivered until the comment URL is
available. If GitHub authentication, permissions, or connectivity prevents
posting, retry once, then report the publication failure explicitly and return
the complete copy-ready Markdown evidence. Never claim PR evidence was posted
without verifying the resulting comment URL.
