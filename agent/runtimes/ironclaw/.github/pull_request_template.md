## Summary

<!-- 2-5 bullet points: what changed and why -->

-

## Change Type

<!-- Check all that apply. Refactor-only PRs are for core team or maintainer-requested work. -->

- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] CI/Infrastructure
- [ ] Security
- [ ] Dependencies

## Linked Issue

<!-- Closes #N, Fixes #N, Related #N, or "None". New feature PRs must link an approved issue. -->

## Validation

<!-- How did you verify this works? -->

- [ ] `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- [ ] `cargo clippy --all --benches --tests --examples --all-features -- -D warnings`
- [ ] `cargo build`
- [ ] Relevant tests pass: <!-- list specific tests -->
- [ ] `cargo test -p <owning-crate> --features integration` if database-backed or runtime-integration behavior changed (the root `integration` feature is empty — the flag is per-crate)
- [ ] Manual testing: <!-- describe what you tested -->
- [ ] If a coding agent was used and supports it, `review-pr` or `pr-shepherd --fix` was run before requesting review

## Test Strategy

<!-- Complete every field. Use `Not applicable: <reason>` when a tier is not needed. See docs/internal/testing-playbook.md. -->

User behavior:

Risk areas:
- [ ] Model behavior
- [ ] Browser
- [ ] Side effect
- [ ] Persistence
- [ ] Security or permissions
- [ ] External provider
- [ ] Cross-component behavior

Tests added or updated:
- Unit or contract:
- Reborn integration:
- Recorded fixture:
- Browser E2E:
- Backend or runtime:
- Live canary:

## Security Impact

<!-- Does this change affect: permissions, network calls, secrets, file access, tool execution, sandbox policy? If yes, describe. If no, write "None". -->

## Reborn Trust-Boundary Checklist

<!-- Required for Reborn/security/runtime/DB changes. Write "N/A" with reason if not relevant. -->

- [ ] Public policy/evidence/trust-bearing types: who can construct them?
- [ ] Untrusted content enters prompts only through an envelope/escaping primitive.
- [ ] Hashes declare purpose; trust/binding/authenticity uses SHA-256/BLAKE3 or separate authenticity check.
- [ ] New/changed status, exit, policy, runtime, or error variants: downstream match sites audited. Command/output:
- [ ] Security/durability `serde(default)` fields fail closed or have migration tests.
- [ ] Queues/maps/buffers/counters have bounds and overflow-safe arithmetic.
- [ ] Driver/operator-visible errors have stable class semantics (`Transient`, `Permanent`, `Misconfigured`, `PolicyDenied` or equivalent).
- [ ] Sandbox/native/host names accurately describe trust boundary.

## Database Impact

<!-- Does this add/modify migrations, change schema, or affect both PostgreSQL and libSQL? If yes, describe. If no, write "None". -->

## Blast Radius

<!-- What subsystems does this touch? What could break? -->

## Rollback Plan

<!-- How to revert if this causes problems? For Track C changes, this is mandatory. -->

## Review Follow-Through

<!-- Review conversations are author-owned. Summarize any known follow-up or areas where reviewer judgment is still needed. -->
