Avoid `!cmd` shell escapes for project commands so shell behavior is explicit and multi-line commands share one shell context.",

If a project import, test, script, CLI, or dependency check is needed, run it through that project's own environment and normal command interface. For example, in a Python repo use its documented commands, `uv run ...`, `.venv/bin/python ...`, or the active project interpreter from the repo root. Treat failures from that native environment as the relevant result.",
