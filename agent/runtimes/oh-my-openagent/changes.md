## 2026-08-13 — Track Senpi 2026.8.13 for the omo-ai beta line

All native Senpi workspace pins now use `2026.8.13` across the root, native
launcher, OmO Senpi adapter, and task engine. Senpi 2026.8.13 adds `baseten`
and `qwen-token-plan-individual`; this update also synchronizes the local map
with the already-available `opengateway` provider. Keep
`packages/omo-native/bin/lib/provider-map.json` synchronized with
`builtinProviders()` whenever the shared pin moves.

The lockfile must move with the exact pins. The focused pin tests continue to
reject manifest drift, while the provider-map contract now compares the local
map directly with the installed engine registry.

## 2026-08-06 — Model packed Senpi installs in compatibility fixtures

The root Senpi compatibility fixture now passes the packed plugin path explicitly when exercising
`runSenpiInstaller`. This keeps the hermetic packed-layout test on the immutable verification path
after source installs began rebuilding generated artifacts unconditionally.

Future compatibility fixtures must choose the installer mode deliberately: omit `pluginPath` only
for a real source-tree refresh, and provide it when modeling a published or packed plugin.

## 2026-08-11 — Publish native task lifecycle snapshots over RPC

The OmO Senpi task component now emits safe `omo.task.updated` snapshots on session start and every
task-store mutation. Snapshots are scoped to the captured parent session and include only display,
model, lifecycle, residency, timing, and optional terminal run-stat fields; durable notification and
root-session bookkeeping must never cross the RPC boundary. Older Senpi hosts without `pi.rpc`
remain a no-op compatibility path.

## 2026-08-12 — Require the request-capable Senpi release

All native Senpi workspace pins now use `2026.8.11-6`, the first published release that exposes
`pi.rpc.handle`, `extension_request`, and `RpcClient.requestExtension`. Earlier releases can still
receive extension events but cannot serve desktop task send/cancel/output requests.

Keep the root, native launcher, OmO Senpi adapter, and task engine pins aligned. Downgrading any one
of them to an emit-only host silently turns the interactive task panel back into telemetry-only UI.

## 2026-08-12 — Track Senpi 2026.8.12-4 for the omo-ai beta line

All native Senpi workspace pins now use `2026.8.12-4` (root, native launcher, OmO Senpi adapter, and
task engine), moving the omo-ai 5.0.0 beta line onto the Senpi 2026.8.12 engine train. The
four-surface alignment rule above still holds: `packages/omo-native/test/senpi-pin.test.ts` fails any
manifest that drifts from the shared pin, so all four move in one commit.

## 2026-08-13 — Record the OmO 5.0.0 beta.7 release

Release PR #6797 merged the `v5.0.0-beta.7` source state at
`923726cdeb0bd0c1d60cdf83dc4cf6fe1117a548` and published
`omo-ai@5.0.0-0.beta.7`. The published package pins
`@code-yeongyu/senpi@2026.8.12-4`; future release preparation must keep the
root, `omo-native`, `omo-senpi`, `senpi-task`, lockfile, generated extension
bundle, and pin tests aligned before tagging.

The release also includes `d694add58dd1` (`fix(omo-native): emit doctor report
atomically`). Doctor output now becomes visible only after a complete report is
ready, so consumers must not reintroduce partially written report files or
split the atomic write path during future release refactors.
