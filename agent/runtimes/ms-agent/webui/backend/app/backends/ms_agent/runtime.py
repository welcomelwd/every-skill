# Turn lifecycle (product decision, aligned with the frontend team): a running
# turn is NEVER stopped by a client going away — navigation, refresh AND a
# fully closed browser all leave it running to completion in the background
# (the SessionLog persists the answer; the viewer re-attaches or reloads it
# later). The ONLY thing that cancels a turn is the explicit Stop button
# (POST /api/chat/interrupt). POST /api/presence remains as a running-state
# poll that drives the sidebar spinners / re-attach, not a liveness contract.

#                  per-round and is mistimed — it emits only after the *next*
#                  input arrives, see llm_agent.py:1591 vs :1617).
