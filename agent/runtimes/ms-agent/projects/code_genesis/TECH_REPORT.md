# Code Genesis: A Production-Ready Multi-Agent Framework for End-to-End Project Generation

We introduce **Code Genesis**, an open-source, compositional code agent framework that orchestrates specialized AI agents to autonomously generate production-ready software projects from natural language requirements. Code Genesis implements a holistic engineering pipeline that spans from requirement analysis to deployment-ready artifacts, achieving high-fidelity project generation with minimal human intervention.

## 1. Design Philosophy & Architecture

### 1.1 Core Principles

Code Genesis is built on three foundational pillars:

**Compositional Workflow Architecture**: We adopt a modular agent design where each specialized agent encapsulates a distinct phase of the software development lifecycle. This compositional approach enables:
- **Declarative workflow orchestration** through YAML-based configuration
- **Pluggable agent replacement** for domain-specific customization
- **Transparent execution tracing** for debugging and optimization

**Topology-Aware Code Generation**: Code Genesis introduces a **dependency-aware topological scheduler** that:
- Constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of file dependencies
- Enables **parallel code generation** for independent modules while respecting dependency constraints
- Guarantees that generated code references pre-existing entities, eliminating hallucinated imports

**Production-First Engineering**: We prioritize deliverable quality over prototyping speed by integrating:
- **Language Server Protocol (LSP) validation** at code generation time
- **Protocol-driven API contracts** to ensure frontend-backend consistency
- **Automated dependency resolution** and environment bootstrapping
- **Runtime verification and self-healing** through iterative refinement

### 1.2 Workflow Orchestration

Code Genesis provides **two configurable workflow modes** to balance between generation quality and execution speed, enabling users to select the optimal strategy based on project complexity:

#### Standard Workflow (Production-Grade)
<img alt="Workflow Diagram" src="asset/workflow.jpg" />

The standard pipeline implements a rigorous 7-stage process optimized for complex, production-ready projects:

```
User Story → Architect → File Design → File Order → Install → Coding → Refine
```

**Pipeline Stages** (Refer to Section 2 for more details):
1. **User Story Agent**: Requirement parsing and augmentation
2. **Architect Agent**: Technology stack selection and module decomposition
3. **File Design Agent**: Physical file structure generation
4. **File Order Agent**: Dependency graph construction and topological sorting
5. **Install Agent**: Environment bootstrapping and dependency resolution
6. **Coding Agent**: Topology-aware code synthesis with LSP validation
7. **Refine Agent**: Runtime verification and automated deployment

This workflow guarantees architectural coherence, eliminates reference errors through explicit dependency modeling, and produces enterprise-grade codebases with comprehensive documentation.

#### Simple Workflow (Rapid Prototyping)
<img alt="Simple Workflow Diagram" src="asset/simple_workflow.jpg" />

For lightweight projects or quick iterations, the simple workflow condenses the pipeline into 4 core stages:

```
Orchestrator → Install → Coding → Refine
```

**Streamlined Process**:
1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Unified requirement analysis, architecture design, and file planning in a single reasoning step
2. **Install Agent**: Dependency resolution and environment setup
3. **Coding Agent**: Direct code generation with integrated file ordering
4. **Refine Agent**: Validation and deployment

The orchestrator agent encapsulates the first four stages of the standard workflow, sacrificing granular traceability for faster time-to-prototype. This mode is ideal for proof-of-concept projects, educational demos, or single-feature applications.

#### Workflow Comparison

| Aspect                    | Standard Workflow          | Simple Workflow           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Agent Stages**          | 7 specialized agents       | 4 consolidated agents     |
| **Architecture Quality**  | Explicit, auditable design | Implicit, monolithic design |
| **Generation Time**       | Moderate (thorough planning) | Fast (direct execution) |
| **Use Cases**             | Production systems, complex apps | Prototypes, demos, simple tools |

## 2. Multi-Agent System Design

Code Genesis decomposes project generation into seven specialized agents, each operating on structured intermediate representations to maintain engineering rigor throughout the pipeline.

### 2.1 User Story Agent: Semantic Requirement Engineering

**Objective**: Transform informal user requirements into structured, engineering-grade user stories.

**Methodology**:
- **Semantic Parsing**: Employs natural language understanding to extract functional requirements, quality attributes, and implicit constraints
- **Requirement Augmentation**: Proactively identifies missing specifications (e.g., authentication, error handling, accessibility) based on project type
- **Standardization**: Outputs INVEST-compliant user stories

### 2.2 Architect Agent: System Blueprint Synthesis

**Objective**: Generate a cohesive system architecture with technology stack selection and module decomposition.

**Design Outputs**:
- **Technology Stack (Framework)**: Frontend/backend frameworks, databases, middleware with version specifications
- **Communication Protocol**: RESTful API, GraphQL, or WebSocket with schema definitions
- **Module Hierarchy**: Logical partitioning with explicit inter-module dependencies

### 2.3 File Design Agent: Physical Project Structure

**Objective**: Materialize the architectural blueprint into a concrete file tree with package structures.

**Capabilities**:
- **Layer-Based Organization**: Implements horizontal slicing (services, controllers, repositories, models), grouping same-level components across modules into unified packages
- **Module-to-File Mapping**: Reads the module list from `modules.txt` and designs a complete file list for each module with descriptions

### 2.4 File Order Agent: Dependency-Driven Scheduling

**Objective**: Establish a topologically sorted generation sequence to prevent reference errors.

**Methodology**:
1. **Dependency Analysis**: Analyzes file design and framework specifications to infer dependency relationships between files (e.g., DAO ← Service ← Controller, CSS ← JS ← HTML)
2. **Index-Based Grouping**: Assigns each file an index number where:
   - Files with the same index are functionally independent and can be generated in parallel
   - Files with higher indices can depend on files with lower indices, but not vice versa
3. **Completeness Validation**: Ensures all files from file_design are included in the ordering with runtime assertions

### 2.5 Install Agent: Environment Bootstrapping

**Objective**: Prepare the runtime environment with all necessary dependencies.

**Workflow**:
1. **Dependency Manifest Generation**: Synthesizes complete dependency lists from file design and technology stack
2. **Package Manager Invocation**: Executes `pip install`, `npm install`, `mvn install` within the workspace
3. **Environment Validation**: Verifies installation success and resolves version conflicts

### 2.6 Coding Agent: Topology-Aware Implementation

**Objective**: Generate high-quality, production-ready source code adhering to the established architecture and file order.

**Engineering Rigor**:
- **Topological Awareness**: Strictly follows the dependency-sorted file order to guarantee reference validity
- **Protocol Compliance**: Implements API contracts exactly as specified in the architectural protocol
- **Relative Path Imports**: Uses workspace-relative imports for portability across environments

**LSP Integration**: Each generated file is validated through Language Server Protocol checks:
- **Syntax Validation**: Ensures syntactic correctness
- **Type Checking**: Verifies type consistency (for statically typed languages)
- **Import Resolution**: Confirms all imports resolve to existing files

**Self-Correction Loop**: If LSP reports errors, the agent performs localized revisions without regenerating the entire file, maintaining coherence while fixing specific issues.

### 2.7 Refine Agent: Runtime Validation & Deployment

**Objective**: Serve as the final quality gate through dynamic execution and automated repair.

**Refinement Process**:
1. **Compilation/Execution Testing**: Attempts to run the generated project (e.g., `python app.py`, `npm start`)
2. **Error Pattern Recognition**: Detects common multi-agent hallucinations:
   - Framework version mismatches
   - API signature inconsistencies
   - Protocol violations (e.g., incorrect HTTP methods)
   - Third-party library API misuse
3. **Surgical Corrections**: Applies minimal, targeted fixes to resolve runtime errors
4. **Integration Testing**: Validates frontend-backend communication, database connectivity, and middleware functionality

**Automated Deployment**: Upon successful validation, the agent leverages EdgeOne Pages (via MCP integration) to:
- Packages the project (excluding build artifacts and dependencies) into a deployment-ready archive
- Deploys to EdgeOne Pages cloud platform automatically
- Provides publicly accessible URLs for immediate user interaction and testing
