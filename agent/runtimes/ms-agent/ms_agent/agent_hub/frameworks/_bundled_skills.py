"""Shared bundled/default skill filtering for CoPaw-family frameworks.

Both Hermes and QwenPaw (a.k.a. CoPaw) install a large library of
framework-provided skills (docx, pdf, browser_cdp, cron, QA_source_index, ...)
on startup. Only *user-authored* skills should travel across machines and
frameworks, so this mixin drops every file under a framework skill directory,
identifying framework skills by their ``SKILL.md`` frontmatter.
