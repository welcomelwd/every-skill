"""Bridge between SkillCatalog and the slash command system.

Registers as an interceptor (lowest priority tier) in CommandRouter.
Disabled skills can still be triggered via / (per meeting decision).

Match logic: skill_id (directory name) first, then frontmatter name.

Besides the interactive interceptor path, two public helpers expose the same
expansion semantics to non-interactive surfaces (WebUI backend, future TUI):

- ``expand_skill(catalog, name_or_id, args)`` — structured invocation: the
  caller already knows which skill the user picked (e.g. a composer dropdown
  sent the skill id alongside the message).
- ``expand_slash_text(catalog, text)`` — free-text invocation: find the first
  whitespace-delimited ``/token`` anywhere in the text (Claude-Code-style
  boundary rule, not just line start), gate it against the catalog, and expand
  with the rest of the text as the arguments. Unknown ``/x`` tokens fall
  through (return None) so ordinary prose is never hijacked.
